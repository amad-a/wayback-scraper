<p><font size="3">The Friends of the Blind Association is a charitable institution
concerned with the various aspect of life of the blind. It was founded in the city of
Al-Bireh/Ramallah, Palestine in 1976. Its activities cover all parts of Palestine. FBA is
authorized by the social welfare office in the district of Ramallah and is a member of the
Union of Charitable Associations in West Bank and Jordan.</font><font size="2"></p>
<p></font><u><strong><font size="3">FBA Goals:</font></strong></u></p>
<p><font size="3">The Friends of the Blind Association aims at:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="3">Safeguarding all interests of the blind on all levels</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Working toward the improvement of the conditions of the blind, be they
      social, economic, educational or vocational</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Raising the public awareness as to the situation, needs and conditions of
      the blind people and promoting the public&#146;s understanding and response to the
      problems and needs facing the blind people of the Palestinian population.</font></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p><u><strong><font size="3">Achievements:</font></strong></u></p>
<p><font size="3"><strong>Education:</strong> FBA established The National School for
Blind Girls in 1978 in a building rented from the department of Islamic Waqf. In 1992, the
school acquired a Thermoform Braillion Duplicator and a supply of special Braille paper .
Students&#146; desks were renewed as well. The association also purchased a central
electronic Braille machine (Everest D). To encourage education, the FBA offers
scholarships for its outstanding students to help them continue their education.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><strong>Health:</strong> Admitted students undergo a medical examination
and those classified as treatable get due attention by the association to help them
medically. Most medical care is provided by St. Johns Hospital in Jerusalem (Alquds) and a
doctor visits the school once a week.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><strong>Nutrition:</strong> FBA provides the students with all food
necessities.</font></p>
<p><u><strong><font size="3">Administration and Logistics:</font></strong></u></p>
<p><font size="3">In addition to the school, the FBA has a rented flat for the
accommodation of teachers and for blind girls working in factories Ramallah. The school
obtained a computer and a fax machine in 1992 to facilitate administrative duties.</font></p>
<p><u><strong><font size="3">Future Plans:</font></strong></u></p>
<p><font size="3">FBA is planning to improve and extend its current services. Planned
activities include:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="3">Expanding the school and increasing the number of employees</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Purchasing laundry equipment and a cleaner</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Obtaining a computer and special related equipment/devices to help the
      students learn in an efficient way</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Getting books, equipment and furniture for the school library as well as
      a public library for the blind</font></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p><u><strong><font size="3">If you can help:</font></strong></u></p>
<p><font size="3">Despite the lack of a stable income, FBA managed to support its current
activities thanks to miscellaneous financial help/donations from kind and concerned
people. However, help from local sources is insufficient for our future plans.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The Friends of the Blind Associations will be very thankful to those
who&#146;d like to extend their generous hand and help us achieve our goals. </font></p>
