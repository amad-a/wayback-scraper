<center><h2>Palestine: Destroyed Villages (1948)</h2></center>
<center><hr>
<font size="+1" color="green">"Jewish villages were built in the place of 
Arab villages. You
do not even know the names of these Arab villages, and I don't blame you because geography books 
no longer exist, not only do the boooks not exist, the Arab villages are not there either. Nahlal arose in 
the place of Mahlul; Kibbutz Gvat in the place of Jibta; Kibbutz Sarid in the place of 
Huneifis; and Kefar Yehushu'a in the place of Tal al-Shuman. There is not one single place built in this country
that did not have a former Arab population."</font><br>[ Moshe Dayan, in 
Haifa, quoted by Ha'aretz, April, 4 1969. Reproduced by Ed Walid Khalidi in the book "All That Remains - see below]</center>

Most of the data here come from the book 
<b>All That Remains</b> (Ed. Walid Khalidi, ISBN 0-88728-224-5, published by The Institute for the Palestine Studies.<br>
The map was based on one prepared  by Dr Ghazi Falah (appears in black and white in the book appendix).
<br> Also, info is ocasionally taken from The Arabic desk reference: Mu'jam Buldaan Filastiin (Muhammad Shurrab). More
sources may be used later on.
