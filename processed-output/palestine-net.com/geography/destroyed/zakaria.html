        <font size="3">The village stood on undulating ground that wasunderlain by soft white Eocene limestone, in the westernfoothills of the Heron Mountains. It was next to the road betweenBayt Jibrin and the Jerusalem-Jafa highway. This road linked itto other lateral roads and led to Bethlehem and a number ofvillages, among them Ajjur, Dayr Al-Dubban, and Tall Al-Safi. Thevillage name reflected the cultural continuity of the area'spopulation with the Roman and Byzantine periods; the site wascalled Caper Zacharia during those times and fell witin theadminstrative jurisdiction of Bayt Jibrin. In 1596, Zakaryya wasa village in the liwa of Jerusalem, with a population of 259. Itpaid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat, barley, andolives, as well as on other types of produce, such a goats andbeehives.</font>

        <font size="3">In the late nineteenth century, Zakariyya stoodon the slope above a broad, flat valley, surrounded by extensiveolive groves. The village had a rectangular layout and theresidents, who were Muslim, built their houses of stone and mud.The older parts of the village were located at its center and inits northern and southern quarters. The center consisted of amosque, a shrine for a Shaykh Hasan, a busy marketplace, and an nelementary school. The village expanded on all sides in moderntimes, especially to the north and south. The villagers obtainedtheir drinking water from tow communal wells-the al-Saflani well,drilled next to Wadi Ajjur, and the Al-Sarara well, north of thevillage. Some water also came from domestic wells that gatheredrainwater. Rainfed agriculture represented the backbone of theeconomy; the main crops included grain, beans, fruit, and olives.In 1945 a total of 6,523 dunums was allocated to cereals; 961dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, of which 440 dunumswere planted with olive trees. The second most importantoccupation of the villagers was animal husbandry. They grazedtheir goats and sheep on the wild shrubs and grasses that grew onthe slopes of the hills and wadis. Near the site of the villagewere many ancient localities. About 1 Km to the southwest wasTall Zakariyya, which rises 117 m above the plain. The plain tothe east has been identified with the Valley of Elah where,according to the Bible (1 Samuel 17), David fought Goliath. TallZakariyya was excavated in 1898 and has been identified withAzekah, a town which may have been referred to in a text writtenon a broken shard that was found at Tall al-Duwayr. Azekah wassaid to be the place where Joshua triumphed over the Cannanites(Joshua 10:10)</font>

        <font size="3">Zakariyya first came under attack early in thewar in the course of the battles around the Kfar Etzion Block ofJewish settlements south of Bethlehem. Along with Dayr Aban andBayt Nattif, it was besieged by a Hoganah unit estimated at 100men by Arab sources quoted by the New York Times. &quot;Thepunitive expedition &quot; against the villages, in retaliationfor the ambush of a Plamach shock force nearby, persisted for about twenty-four hours. The times also said the Israeli forcesdirected their fire at the villages on 17 and 18 January 1948.</font>

        <font size="3">Zakariyya was occupied over nine month later,towards the end of operation ha-Har and Yo'av, when Isreal'soperational areas became contiguous in the last week of October1948. Israeli units broke through at the village on 23 October1948, linking the Israeli-held parts of the Hebron hills with theJerusalem corridor. Unlike most of the inhabitants of villagesconquered in these operations, the villagers were not displacedat the item of occupation. However, Israeli historian BennyMorris reports that over a year later, towards the end of 1949,the Israeli military drew up a plan to evict the people ofZakariyya, along with those of some seven other villages (mostlyin the northen Galilee). But Morris adds that &quot;politcalobjections by the Foreign Ministry blocked implementations.</font>

        <font size="3">Efforts to expel the people of Zakariyya wasone of the longest-lasting of these communities, despite the&quot;appalling&quot; health and food situation in the village,according to Morris. In March 1949, the Israeli Interior Minestryofficial in charge of the Jerusalem District noted that &quot;inthe village there are many good houses, and it is possible toaccommodate in them several hundred new immigrants.&quot; InJanuary 1950, Ben-Gurion met with his foreign minister, MosheSharett, and Jewish National Fund official Yosef Weitz anddecided to evict the inhabitants of Zakariyya &quot;(but) withoutcoercion.&quot; They were eventually evicted on 9 June 1950-themeans of expulsion are not mentioned-and most were transferred toal-Ramla, with some possibly going to Jordan.</font>

        <font size="3">The settlement of Zekharya was established in1950 on village land, close to the village site.</font>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="3">The mosque and a number of houses, someoccupied by Jewish residents and others deserted, remain on thesite. Large sections of the site itself were covered with wildvegetations. The mosque is in a state of neglect; segments of itswalls and roof and the surrounding ground are overgrow with wildvegetations. An Israeli flag is planted on top o the minaret. Oneof the occupied houses is a two-story stone structure with a flatroof. Its second story windows have round arches and grill work.Parts of the surrounding land are cultivated by Israeli farmers.</font>

        <font size="3">Many of the original inhabitants and theirdescendants reside in the West Bank towns like Beit Jala, Arouband Duheisha camps. Also some are in Saudi Arabia, the GulfStates, Scandinavia, and the United States</font>
