        <font size="+1">Palestine, the land of the three monotheisticfaiths, is where the Palestinian Arab people was born, on which it grew,developed and excelled. Thus the Palestinian Arab people ensured for itselfan everlasting union between itself, its land, and its history.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">Resolute throughout that history, the PalestinianArab people forged its national identity, rising even to unimagined levelsin its defense, as invasion, the design of others, and the appeal specialto Palestine's ancient and luminous place on the eminence where powersand civilizations are joined. All this intervened thereby to deprive thepeople of its political independence. Yet the undying connection betweenPalestine and its people secured for the land its character, and for thepeople its national genius.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">Nourished by an unfolding series of civilizationsand cultures, inspired by a heritage rich in variety and kind, the PalestinianArab people added to its stature by consolidating a union between itselfand its patrimonial Land. The call went out from Temple, Church, and Mosquethat to praise the Creator, to celebrate compassion and peace was indeedthe message of Palestine. And in generation after generation, the PalestinianArab people gave of itself unsparingly in the valiant battle for liberationand homeland. For what has been the unbroken chain of our people's rebellionsbut the heroic embodiment of our will for national independence. And sothe people was sustained in the struggle to stay and to prevail.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">When in the course of modern times a new orderof values was declared with norms and values fair for all, it was the PalestinianArab people that had been excluded from the destiny of all other peoplesby a hostile array of local and foreign powers. Yet again had unaided justicebeen revealed as insufficient to drive the world's history along its preferredcourse.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">And it was the Palestinian people, already woundedin its body, that was submitted to yet another type of occupation overwhich floated that falsehood that &quot;Palestine was a land without people.&quot;This notion was foisted upon some in the world, whereas in Article 22 ofthe Covenant of the League of Nations (1919) and in the Treaty of Lausanne(1923), the community of nations had recognized that all the Arab territories,including Palestine, of the formerly Ottoman provinces, were to have grantedto them their freedom as provisionally independent nations.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">Despite the historical injustice inflicted onthe Palestinian Arab people resulting in their dispersion and deprivingthem of their right to self-determination, following upon U.N. GeneralAssembly Resolution 181 (1947), which partitioned Palestine into two states,one Arab, one Jewish, yet it is this Resolution that still provides thoseconditions of international legitimacy that ensure the right of the PalestinianArab people to sovereignty.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">By stages, the occupation of Palestine and partsof other Arab territories by Israeli forces, the willed dispossession andexpulsion from their ancestral homes of the majority of Palestine's civilianinhabitants, was achieved by organized terror; those Palestinians who remained,as a vestige subjugated in its homeland, were persecuted and forced toendure the destruction of their national life.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">Thus were principles of international legitimacyviolated. Thus were the Charter of the United Nations and its Resolutionsdisfigured, for they had recognized the Palestinian Arab people's nationalrights, including the right of Return, the right to independence, the rightto sovereignty over territory and homeland.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">In Palestine and on its perimeters, in exile distantand near, the Palestinian Arab people never faltered and never abandonedits conviction in its rights of Return and independence. Occupation, massacresand dispersion achieved no gain in the unabated Palestinian consciousnessof self and political identity, as Palestinians went forward with theirdestiny, undeterred and unbowed. And from out of the long years of trialin ever-mounting struggle, the Palestinian political identity emerged furtherconsolidated and confirmed. And the collective Palestinian national willforged for itself a political embodiment, the Palestine Liberation Organization,its sole, legitimate representative recognized by the world community asa whole, as well as by related regional and international institutions.Standing on the very rock of conviction in the Palestinian people's inalienablerights, and on the ground of Arab national consensus and of internationallegitimacy, the PLO led the campaigns of its great people, molded intounity and powerful resolve, one and indivisible in its triumphs, even asit suffered massacres and confinement within and without its home. Andso Palestinian resistance was clarified and raised into the forefront ofArab and world awareness, as the struggle of the Palestinian Arab peopleachieved unique prominence among the world's liberation movements in themodern era.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">The massive national uprising, the intifada, nowintensifying in cumulative scope and power on occupied Palestinian territories,as well as the unflinching resistance of the refugee camps outside thehomeland, have elevated awareness of the Palestinian truth and right intostill higher realms of comprehension and actuality. Now at last the curtainhas been dropped around a whole epoch of prevarication and negation. Theintifada has set siege to the mind of official Israel, which has for toolong relied exclusively upon myth and terror to deny Palestinian existencealtogether. Because of the intifada and its revolutionary irreversibleimpulse, the history of Palestine has therefore arrived at a decisive juncture.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">Whereas the Palestinian people reaffirms mostdefinitively its inalienable rights in the land of its patrimony:</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">Now by virtue of natural, historical and legalrights, and the sacrifices of successive generations who gave of themselvesin defense of the freedom and independence of their homeland;</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">In pursuance of Resolutions adopted by Arab SummitConferences and relying on the authority bestowed by international legitimacyas embodied in the Resolutions of the United Nations Organization since1947;</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">And in exercise by the Palestinian Arab peopleof its rights to self-determination, political independence and sovereigntyover its territory,</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">The Palestine National Council, in the name ofGod, and in the name of the Palestinian Arab people, hereby proclaims theestablishment of the State of Palestine on our Palestinian territory withits capital Jerusalem (Al-Quds Ash-Sharif).</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">The State of Palestine is the state of Palestinianswherever they may be. The state is for them to enjoy in it their collectivenational and cultural identity, theirs to pursue in it a complete equalityof rights. In it will be safeguarded their political and religious convictionsand their human dignity by means of a parliamentary democratic system ofgovernance, itself based on freedom of expression and the freedom to formparties. The rights of minorities will duly be respected by the majority,as minorities must abide by decisions of the majority. Governance willbe based on principles of social justice, equality and non-discriminationin public rights of men or women, on grounds of race, religion, color orsex, and the aegis of a constitution which ensures the rule of law andan independent judiciary. Thus shall these principles allow no departurefrom Palestine's age-old spiritual and civilizational heritage of toleranceand religious coexistence.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">The State of Palestine is an Arab state, an integraland indivisible part of the Arab nation, at one with that nation in heritageand civilization, with it also in its aspiration for liberation, progress,democracy and unity. The State of Palestine affirms its obligation to abideby the Charter of the League of Arab States, whereby the coordination ofthe Arab states with each other shall be strengthened. It calls upon Arabcompatriots to consolidate and enhance the emein reality of state, to mobilizepotential, and to intensify efforts whose goal is to end Israeli occupation.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">The State of Palestine proclaims its commitmentto the principles and purposes of the United Nations, and to the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. It proclaims its commitment as well to theprinciples and policies of the Non-Aligned Movement.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">It further announces itself to be a peace-lovingState, in adherence to the principles of peaceful co-existence. It willjoin with all states and peoples in order to assure a permanent peace basedupon justice and the respect of rights so that humanity's potential forwell-being may be assured, an earnest competition for excellence may bemaintained, and in which confidence in the future will eliminate fear forthose who are just and for whom justice is the only recourse.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">In the context of its struggle for peace in theland of Love and Peace, the State of Palestine calls upon the United Nationsto bear special responsibility for the Palestinian Arab people and itshomeland. It calls upon all peace-and freedom-loving peoples and statesto assist it in the attainment of its objectives, to provide it with security,to alleviate the tragedy of its people, and to help it terminate Israel'soccupation of the Palestinian territories.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">The State of Palestine herewith declares thatit believes in the settlement of regional and international disputes bypeaceful means, in accordance with the U.N. Charter and resolutions. Withprejudice to its natural right to defend its territorial integrity andindependence, it therefore rejects the threat or use of force, violenceand terrorism against its territorial integrity or political independence,as it also rejects their use against territorial integrity of other states.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">Therefore, on this day unlike all others, November15, 1988, as we stand at the threshold of a new dawn, in all honor andmodesty we humbly bow to the sacred spirits of our fallen ones, Palestinianand Arab, by the purity of whose sacrifice for the homeland our sky hasbeen illuminated and our Land given life. Our hearts are lifted up andirradiated by the light emanating from the much blessed intifada, fromthose who have endured and have fought the fight of the camps, of dispersion,of exile, from those who have borne the standard for freedom, our children,our aged, our youth, our prisoners, detainees and wounded, all those tiesto our sacred soil are confirmed in camp, village, and town. We renderspecial tribute to that brave Palestinian Woman, guardian of sustenanceand Life, keeper of our people's perennial flame. To the souls of our saintedmartyrs, the whole of our Palestinian Arab people that our struggle shallbe continued until the occupation ends, and the foundation of our sovereigntyand independence shall be fortified accordingly.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="+1">Therefore, we call upon our great people to rallyto the banner of Palestine, to cherish and defend it, so that it may foreverbe the symbol of our freedom and dignity in that homeland, which is a homelandfor the free, now and always.</font>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font size="4">In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful:</font>
        <p>
          <font size="4">&quot;Say: 'O God, Master of the Kingdom,</font>
          <p>
            <font size="4">Thou givest the Kingdom to whom Thou wilt,</font>
            <p>
              <font size="4">and seizes the Kingdom from whom Thou wilt,</font>
              <p>
                <font size="4">Thou exalted whom Thou wilt, and Thou</font>
                <p>
                  <font size="4">abasest whom Thou wilt; in Thy hand</font>
                  <p>
                    <font size="4">is the good; Thou are powerful over everything.&quot;</font>
