      Press Release 7/11/2000 
      <br>
      <br>
      In the past twenty-four hours, an attack is being mounted againstGush 
      <br>
      Shalom (The Israeli Peace Bloc). Knesset Member Collette Avital (Labor) 
      <br>
      has actually lodged a complaint with the police, claiming thatcartoons 
      <br>
      presented on our website constitute &quot;incitement&quot;. Andthe powerful American 
      <br>
      Jewish organization &quot;Anti-Defamtion League&quot; found time,even on Elections 
      <br>
      Day over there, to  disseminate a message of defamation againstGush 
      <br>
      Shalom, which already resulted in hate emails being sent to ouraddress. All 
      <br>
      this seems to be part of the ugly atmosphere of witchhunt whichbegins to 
      <br>
      pervade Israeli public life in the past weeks - particularlymanifested in 
      <br>
      inflammatory accusations and police investigations againstKnesset Member 
      <br>
      Muhammad Barake of Hadash and his fellow Arab parliamentarians.This 
      <br>
      campaign is apparently intended to delegitimize all those whodare to speak 
      <br>
      out against the oppressive policies of the Barak Government. 
      <br>
      Following is Gush Shalom's answer to Rabbi David Rosen of the 
      <br>
      Anti-Defamation League. We also advise you to see for yourselfthe cartoons 
      <br>

      Tel-Aviv, 7/11/2000 
      <br>
      <br>
      Dear Sir 
      <br>
      <br>
      In an ADL press release which was published today you are quotedas 
      <br>
      expressing &quot;outrage&quot; at Gush Shalom's portrayal ofPrime Minister Barak as 
      <br>
      a killer of Palestinian children in a caricature on its web site,and as stating 
      <br>
      that &quot;The image of a militant Barak standing on the bleedingbullet-ridden 
      <br>
      body of a Palestinian child is abhorrent&quot;. 
      <br>
      We fully share your feelings of outrage and abhorrence - outrageand 
      <br>
      abhorrence not at a cartoon, a few bytes of virtual reality, butat the true cruel 
      <br>
      reality which that cartoon faithfully reflects. A reality beingenacted day after 
      <br>
      day after day in the Occupied Territories, a reality of Israelimilitary snipers 
      <br>
      taking careful aim with their telescopic sights and shooting high-velocity 
      <br>
      ammunition at unarmed opponents - men and women, boys and girls. 
      <br>
      Snipers aiming carefully at the upper part of the body, shootingwith 
      <br>
      deliberation and the full intention of causing death or graveinjury. One of 
      <br>
      these snipers spoke on prime time Israeli TV two weeks ago,describing 
      <br>
      quite frankly what he is about. He was not particularly happyabout what he 
      <br>
      is doing - which did not prevent him from going on doing it dayafter day. 
      <br>
      (Surely his regret is a great consolation to the parents of hisvictims). 
      <br>
      Yes, we do indeed feel quite a lot of outrage and abhorrence atthis reality in 
      <br>
      which we live: a reality of blood and brains dripping off intothe dust, of more 
      <br>
      than a hundred young lives extinguished, of thousands of otheryoung lives 
      <br>
      irrevocably crippled and blighted. Lives such as that of the 14-yearold girl 
      <br>
      Ghazala Jradat, hit in the head by an Israeli bullet and leftclinically dead on 
      <br>
      the afternoon of Saturday, November 4 - the very same day onwhich Mr. 
      <br>
      Ehud Barak, Prime Minister and Defence Minister of Israel, hadthe 
      <br>
      unbelievable chutzpa to mount the podium at the Rabin MemorialRally in Tel- 
      <br>
      Aviv, address a crowd estimated at 150,000 people and unblikinglypresent 
      <br>
      himself as &quot;A peace seeker&quot;(sic).          
      <br>
      Outrage and abhorrence is, indeed, what we feel. Also some twingeof guilt - 
      <br>
      for not only did practically all of us in Gush Shalom vote 
      <br>
      for Barak last year, but we even published an ad endorsng hiscandidature. 
      <br>
      Of course, we did it in the sincere hope that he would be true tohis 
      <br>
      campaign promises, that he would indeed make a historical peacewith our 
      <br>
      Palestinian neighbors. Neverthless, now that reality turned outto be 
      <br>
      diametrically opposite, we bear a share in the responsibility forhorrors 
      <br>
      perpetrated by the leader we chose. We are all the more dutybound to raise 
      <br>
      our voice in the loudest protest which we could manage with ourlimited 
      <br>
      means and resources. 
      <br>
      The cartoon of which you speak, which depicts Mr. Barak with buta small 
      <br>
      portion of the ugliness with which he so richly deserves to beshown, is part 
      <br>
      of that protest, part of our expression of outrage and abhorrence.Publishing 
      <br>
      it is, in our view, about the most fitting and becoming act whichan Israeli 
      <br>
      organization advocating peace can perform at the present dark andshameful 
      <br>
      period in the history of our country. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Still, after consulting with my fellow activists I am in aposition to make an 
      <br>
      offer. Should a complete week - seven (7) days - pass in whichnot a single 
      <br>
      unarmed Palestinian is killed by the Israeli armed forces whichare 
      <br>
      answerable to Mr. Barak, we would  remove the abovementionedcartoon 
      <br>
      from our website. 
      <br>
      <br>
      As for the ADL - an organization which claims to &quot;counteracthatred, 
      <br>
      prejudice and bigotry&quot; - can you truly find no other placesto search for such, 
      <br>
      with Israeli society in its present condition,  except at ourmodest website?   
      <br>

      ADL Outraged at &quot;Peace&quot; Group's Portrayal of PrimeMinister Barak as Child 
      <br>
      Killer 
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Jerusalem November 7, 2000.The Anti-Defamation League expressed 
      <br>
      outrage at Gush Shalom's portrayal of Prime Minister Barak as akiller of 
      <br>
      Palestinian children in a caricature on its web site. 
      <br>
      <br>
      &quot;The image of a militant Barak standing on the bleedingbullet ridden body 
      <br>
      of a Palestinian child is abhorrent and certainly unbecoming of agroup 
      <br>
      which describes itself as &quot;advocating peace,&quot; saidRabbi David Rosen, 
      <br>
      Director of ADL's Israel Office. 
      <br>
      <br>
      &quot;At this particularly tense time, and as we arecommemorating the fifth 
      <br>
      anniversary of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin it behoovesindividuals 
      <br>
      and organizations to express their political views in aresponsible 
      <br>
      manner avoiding inciteful language and imagery. Regretfully, thisis not 
      <br>
      the only example of offensive and inciteful web postings by GushShalom,&quot; 
      <br>
      he added. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The Anti-Defamation League, founded in 1913, is the world'sleading 
      <br>
      organization fighting anti-Semitism through programs and servicesthat 
      <br>
      counteract hatred, prejudice and bigotry.
