<b>marcel<br>I visited Gaza in 77' and saw the self imposed squalor and filth with my own eyes.The popular lie today that Israel destroyed an infrastructure that 
never existed, even under Egyptian rule is just another of many despicable lies.
Twenty years later on the road to Hebron, I once again witnessed the filth and grafitti and how the people throw their trash out their front door.
To live like pigs and blame it on Israel is not acceptable. Stop with all these lies.   
To blame Israel
for this self inflicted misery is a cowardly copout. </b><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991004060633/mailto:papaya@gdi.net">papaya@gdi.net</a></p><p>
