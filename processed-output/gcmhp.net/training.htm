        When established in 1990, the primarystaff at the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme (GCMHP) recognizedthe absence of training institutes that could adequately prepare mentalhealth professionals in Gaza. To overcome this problem, the Programme embarkedon ambitious 
        <b>
          <a href="#in">in-service training activities</a>
        </b>
         forthe staff at GCMHP and attracted trainers from prestigious training institutesfrom around the world. The trainers provided in-house training to the GCMHPstaff so as to enable them to offer quality services to the Palestinianpopulation. Several selected members of the staff went abroad to furthertheir professional skills and returned with an increased capacity to assistin the training of local staff. The capacity of the Palestinian staff toconduct their own culturally sensitive training has also increased. In1995, a 
        <b>one-year training of trainer’s course</b>
         was conducted forfive mental health professionals from GCMHP. The course aimed to improvethe local trainers' training skills, enabling them to properly train others.

        In addition to training GCMHP staff,the Programme has increasingly been called upon to train other Palestinianhealth care providers in various mental health skills. For example, in1993 the Programme successfully completed a

        </b>
         Twelvenurses from the Palestinian Health System attended the course. In 1994,the department conducted a

        </b>.
        Twelve social workers, psychologists, nurses, anddoctors from different governmental and non-governmental organizationscompleted the course. These promising results encouraged the training Departmentto organize another course in 1995 for another fifteen professionals. Uponthe completion of the course, the Palestinian Ministry of Education employedall students as mental health professionals in health institutions andas school counselors. In 1996, the department organized
