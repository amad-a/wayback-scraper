My daughter says to me, "Mom, why do you do this to yourself? Whydon’t you take a cruise and see nice places instead?" Nevertheless, I goout of principle. Sometimes I foresee the results. I know what is goingto happen before it does. It is like the elections: you know who is goingto win.</font>

        <font color="#000099">This conference is the only one Ihave been to recently about which I felt enthused. The people were genuine,spontaneous. They were so generous and loving! Mind you, I come from avery dry environment. I come from England where every person is like acactus in its own wilderness. Each human being is left on his own.</font>

        <font color="#000099">Another thing is that -- perhaps Isaw it many years ago in Mozambique, Algeria, and Zimbabwe -- people onthe morning of independence, the eve of independence, tend to be romantic,idealistic, and full of hope. They have the capacity to hope. I also sawhow it is possible with people who are committed and selfless to do thingsor try to achieve things. I am happy to have made it this time. I promisedmyself to come and ask you to give me a Palestinian nationality so I couldspend the rest of my life in Gaza. I have been in transit for the last25 years. I do not want to die in England. Here I have my friends whomI do not see or hear from very often, though we remain friends. You areextraordinary. You remain yourself in a world that erodes you and erodesthe hope in your heart. It is something fantastic. It really gladdens myheart. I have to come back again. I feel like I am home. Thank you.</font>

        <font color="#000099">The first time I was inspired to thinkof Palestine was in Shatilla, in Beirut, in 1982. I met a Palestinian doctorwho was about 60. I asked him why he was in Beirut, what had made him come.He said he was an Arab doctor in Tel Aviv, and as an Arab doctor, he wouldbring things to be recognized by the Israelis, and in this way, he forgothis identity. In addition, it suddenly occurred to him that the Palestinianpeople were more important to him than his identity. They were to be respectedby the Israelis. So he left for Lebanon, and he said to me, "No money inthe world, no title in the world gives me greater pleasure than the pleasureI enjoy working with our people in the camps of Shatila and elsewhere."That inspired me; then I went through Shatila, and I went back and wrotearticles on the Palestinian situation. Then when I met Eyad, I came toGaza.</font>

      <div dir="LTR">
        <font color="#000099">I think I am in a unique situationbecause this reminds me of my past [in South Africa], which I share withyou. In such a situation as we are in, we always look forward to somethingbetter, but when you have everything, you have nothing to look forwardto. I think that the most important thing that I’ve experienced here isthat togetherness, that feeling of sharing which is still a part of thissociety. As I said earlier -- and I do not know how to explain it...maybeit's because of the closure of the borders -- this sharing of a commonfate, of a common situation, makes it so that the people in Gaza can beas generous as they are. Here there is a sharing which we do not have anymorein well-developed countries because people are living as individuals andnot as people together. What has produced a situation where individualsleave even their families to become individuals? Here, in the Conference,we saw and heard that children who come from intact families have bettercoping strengths both in the field of education and otherwise. This isfast disappearing in Europe, and everybody is looking forward to somewherewhere they can go back to the roots of family life -- and this I thinkis so important in the Palestinian situation. Whether it will change, Ido not know. But I hope we can change the economic situation without changingthe togetherness, the feeling of group solidarity -- and I must say thatthe Programme has done such wonderful work, especially now that there isdialogue between Eyad and the PA. I hope that the situation will only improve.</font>

        <font color="#000099">I think the conference was extremelysuccessful because, unlike many conferences, I go to -- and I do not attendmany -- this one was not full of hot air. They are usually full of hotair. I have a picture that every word being spoken is a tiny balloon thatis drifting out of his mouth. Why did he have to say so much? If it werelike that, then the whole place would be choked with tiny balloons. Butthere was a genuineness, as somebody said, the feeling of solidarity, andnot much of that feeling of voyeurism, people coming to see how lucky theyare, people coming to wallow in the pleasure people take, to tell theirfriends, "I’ve been to Gaza! I have been to Gaza! We are the rescuers..."-- there was not a significant amount of that. The papers were meaningfuland substantial, and most importantly, it was not a kind of theoreticalreflection. People had a purpose in mind; it was evident in their work.There was closeness; it was not a campaigning, but there was action.</font>

No matter how much progress we ever make, human rightsviolations will always occur, and the struggle for human rights can beextremely exhausting. This conference has given us an opportunity to cometogether and rouse one another’s spirits, give one another ideas aboutprograms that can be successful. For those of us who have been in the strugglefor many years, we are comforted by this gathering; and for those of uswho are just beginning to struggle, we are given inspiration. That hasbeen the real beauty of this conference. It has embraced people from allages and all countries, all orientations, who have come together to sharetheir idea, and we thank the GCMHP and Eyad, and especially those who puttogether the conference.</font>

        <font color="#000099">The conference was held in a largewell-equipped center that combines three huge separate meeting rooms. Throughoutthe conference, there was excellent simultaneous translation. Lunches andcoffees were served there, allowing for maximum interaction among the participants.All of the conference participants were entertained each evening for dinnerin a different restaurant in Gaza City.</font>

        <font color="#000099">It is a challenge to portray the atmosphereof this very significant meeting and the context in which it took place.It attracted several hundred international visitors, including many Israeliacademics and human rights activists. For many of the latter, it was thefirst time they had visited Gaza. Ironically, the only people who had difficultyin attending were Palestinians nearby because of the near impossibilityof their getting permission to come to Gaza from the West Bank!</font>

        <font color="#000099">On the one hand, a realistic view ofthe present situation for the Palestinians in that Gaza is now simply onelarge prison for Palestinians. There are soldiers and police around, butunlike before, it is now possible to walk anywhere at night. During mylast visit, there was still a curfew. Now, there is a busy life on thestreets of Gaza after dark that is very gratifying to see.</font>

      <p dir="LTR">
        <font color="#000099">The logistics of organizing a conferenceof this size in Gaza were, to say the least, challenging for the organizers.Every participant had to be driven in three differently licensed vehiclesto get from the airport, through the 'closures' and into Gaza City. Participantswere housed in six different hotels and transported by bus to and the conferencecenter and to the different locations where dinner and evening entertainmentwas offered. Everything was organized perfectly. In the evaluation, theonly complaints were that the live music was too loud during the dinners!</font>
