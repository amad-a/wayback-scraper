      </b>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066">The Gaza Strip is a relatively smallpiece of land, inhabited by nearly one million people. About 50% of thepopulation are under sixteen. The average population density is approximately2150 persons per square KM, making the Strip one of the most densely populatedareas in the world. Unemployment is very high in the Gaza Strip, with conservativeestimates putting the figure at some 40% in the early 1990s. For this reason,employment in Israel is especially important for people living in Gaza.But this, in turn, leaves Palestinians vulnerable to exploitation on theIsraeli labor market. Unemployment puts a unique stress on the individualand the family, frequently resulting in increased health problems and greaterhealth care needs at a time when income is low.</font>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066">Mental health is one of many neglectedareas in the Palestinian health system. The recently revised national healthplan, while acknowledging the need for rehabilitation on paper, has littleto offer in terms of translating this into practice. There are currentlytwo psychiatric hospitals in the autonomous territories, one in the GazaStrip, and the other in the West Bank. They have limited staff, and offerbedside care without any community mental health services. The 32 psychiatricbeds within the Gaza psychiatric unit represent a figure of 0.04 beds per1,000 people, and in a region afflicted with some of the most acute psychologicalproblems anywhere in the world. Nor are there any NGOs working in the areaof mental health in the Gaza Strip other than the GCMHP.</font>

      <b>
        <font color="#000066">2. Problem Definition</font>
      </b>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066">The Palestinian uprising, "The Intifada",was a mass movement of civil disobedience and rebellion against the foreignmilitary occupation.</font>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066">The cost of the Intifada was high, asthe Israeli authorities exercised violent means to suppress the uprising.&nbsp;50,000 were arrested during the Intifada. 250,000 Files for Palestinianprisoners were opened in Israeli Military court since the occupation in1967.(El Damier, 1997).</font>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066">The Landau Commission, set up by theIsraeli High Court of Justice (Siegel-Itzkovich, 1993), has confirmed thatIsraeli military and secret police use methods of torture, especially duringthe interrogation of the detainee. Landau Commission guidelines themselvespermit the use of “moderate physical pressure”. The UN Committee againstTorture considered Israel’s initial report. The Committee found the authorizationof the use of “moderate physical pressure” to be “completely unacceptable”and expressed concern at the “large number of heavily documented casesof ill-treatment in custody”. The Committee recommended that the interrogationprocedures be published and that all interrogation practices in breachof the Convention be ended immediately (Amnesty International Report, 1995).</font>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066">The report of Human Rights Watch/MiddleEast on Israeli interrogation of Palestinians from the Occupied Territories(Sept. 1997) mentioned that the two main Israeli interrogation agenciesin the Occupied Territories engage in a systematic practice of mistreatmentand torture -- according to internationally recognized definitions of theterms -- when trying to extract confessions or information about thirdparties.</font>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066">The overriding strategy of Israeli interrogationagencies is to get uncooperative detainees to talk. They do so by subjectingthem to a coordinated, rigid, and increasingly painful regime of physicalconstraints and psychological pressures over days – and very often forthree or four weeks – during which the detainees are, almost without exception,denied visits by their lawyers and families.</font>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066">The methods used in nearly all interrogationsinclude prolonged sleep deprivation; prolonged sight deprivation usingblind folds or tight fitting hoods; the forced and prolonged maintenanceof particular body positions, which grow increasingly painful; and verbalthreats and insults. These methods are almost always combined with someof the following abuses: confinement in tiny, closet-like spaces; exposureto temperature extremes, such as deliberately overcooled rooms; prolongedtoilet and hygiene deprivation; and degrading treatment, such as forcingdetainees to eat and use the toilet the same time. In a large number ofcases, detainees are also moderately or severely beaten by their interrogators(El-Sarraj, 1995).</font>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066">Palestinian detainees continued to besystematically tortured or ill-treated during interrogation by the GeneralSecurity Service (GSS), often while held incommunicado. Methods used includedhooding with dirty sacks, shackling in painful positions for prolongedperiods, beatings, sleep deprivation and confinement in dark, closet-sizedcell (Amnesty International Report, 1995).</font>

    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066">In the last three years of PalestinianNational Authority (PNA) rule, it launched a number of collective imprisonmentcampaigns, directed mainly against the members of opposition parties, witha particular focus on Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The number of politicalprisoners has reached approximately 1593 (Palestinian Center of Human Rights1997). From our clinical experience in treating some of these prisoners,we have found that various kinds of torture methods have been employed.In fact, many have been subjected to torture techniques similar to thoseused by the Israelis.</font>

      </b>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066">The Human Rights Team was establishedin 1994 to deal with the consequences of human rights violations. The Teamhad consists of 19 professionals, including psychiatrists, clinical psychologists,social workers, psychiatric nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists,and paramedics. In the last three years, the Team has treated 506 victimsof human rights violations. It utilizes various therapeutic approaches,such as supportive therapy, counseling, cognitive-behavioral therapy, occupationaltherapy, and family counseling in order to study the effects of tortureon its victims, and on the community as a whole.</font>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066">
        The team members participated in GCMHP'ssecond intentional conference, "Palestinians in Transition: Rehabilitationand Community Development”, and

    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066">The Human Rights Team has also launcheda program of various training activities for the local community. In threeyears (1994-1997), 14 journal clubs, study days, seminars, and case conferenceshave been conducted by the Team. Two courses in community mental healthfor 24 health professionals were conducted in the last two years, as wellas six courses for social workers, former political prisoners, communityleaders, and community development workers. 106 people participated inthese courses. Furthermore, 16 workshops were held for health and non-healthprofessionals in the field of mental health and human rights. The Team,in an effort to increase public awareness of the psychological effectsof torture and of new approaches to the torture experience, held 28 publicmeetings. These meetings attracted people from various sectors of societyfrom all over the Gaza Strip.</font>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066">Moreover, Team members have attendedinternational conferences outside Gaza in an effort to share their particularexperience with other professionals in the fields of mental health andhuman rights.</font>
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066">The Team’s continuing in-service trainingis a part of the general training programme. Team members participatedin two courses: A course in group therapy (1994-1998), which is supervisedby a South African consultant psychotherapist, and a course in psychotherapy(1993-1997), which was held at Tel-Aviv University.</font>
