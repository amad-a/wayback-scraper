                    The Sakakini Cultural Centre is an non governmental organization dedicated to the promotion of arts and culture in Palestine. Among its goals and objectives are: 
                    <br>
                    " Organizing distinctive events and activities in the visual arts, literature, music and theater: With a focus on fostering explorations of Palestinian cultural identity, international cultural and artistic exchanges, and showcasing innovative artistic productions,

To try and transport the activities to the public, when the public can't come to the activities.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Current sources of revenue are: (for year 2000) Donations ,41% Project-specific grants 39%, members' dues, partial coverage of overhead costs by the Carmel literary quarterly, and ticket sales from events held at the Centre 20%. The annual budget for 2000 was 64,000$. The Sakakini's first funding priority is to secure more donations to cover the total of the running costs and to fundraise for our endowment fund to enable the Centre to pursue its activities in financial security. The target of the endowment is 2,000,000$, so far, the Centre has managed to acquire 116,000$.

                <b>How was the Sakakini Cultural Centre Founded?</b>
                <br>
                Since its opening in May 1996, the Sakakini functioned as a branch of the Palestinian Ministry of Culture, albeit with programmatic independence. Within a year of its opening, consultations assessing the Sakakini's work recommended that in order for it to better fulfill its mission and serve the local community, the Sakakini should change its status into a non governmental organization (NGO). 
                <br>
                For that purpose, a founding board made up of artists and philanthropists was formed by the Director in July 1997, among its tasks were the drafting of bylaws and helping in fundraising. In May 1998, the Sakakini obtained its NGO registration from the Palestinian Ministry of the Interior, and a tax-exempt status granted to non-profit organizations from the Ministry of Finance. In August 1998, an agreement was signed with the Ministry of Culture, whereby the Sakakini's building remains the property of the Ministry, while its premises are used rent free by the new Sakakini-NGO. The Sakakini's general assembly of about 50 members, elected in October 1998 and February 1999 are the Center's administrative and honorary bodies

                <b>
                  <br>What's the history of the Sakakini Cultural Centre's building?</b>
                <br>
                Situated in a quiet area of the booming city of Ramallah -16 Klm. north of Jerusalem. the building housing the KSCC is a model of traditional Palestinian architecture. Built in 1927 with massive pink stone, floors tiled with traditional Palestinian tiles, it is surrounded by a large garden and orchard. It was built for Khalil Salem Salah as a family home. Salah was mayor of Ramallah from 1947 to 1951. In 1995, the house was sold to the Palestinian Ministry of Culture. Renovated by the architectural conservation firm Riwaq with the financial support of the Japanese government, it was converted into a cultural center inaugurated in May 1996.. The ground floor of the Center is made up of a reception area and four rooms used as exhibit space. The first floor houses the Center's administration and the offices of the Al Carmel literary quarterly, edited by the poet Mahmoud Darwish. The top floor is made up of a large multipurpose hall hosting most of the Center's functions. 
                <br>
                The building underwent a second round of renovation in the summer and fall of 1998, when Riwaq oversaw the installation of central heating, landscaped the garden, converted the garage into a larger space to be used as a bookstore, built additional storage space, and a new outer wall and gate. The works were made possible through a grant from the Arab League Education Science and Culture Organization. In 2001 the former garage was renovated and converted into office space for two Sakakini staffers, as well as storage space for paintings. This renovation was made possible by a generous grant by the Ford Foundation and the Ramallah Sakakini Engineering Firm's donation of their supervision and execution fees.

                <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#655658">Khalil Sakakini was born in Jerusalem on January 23, 1878. He received his schooling in Jerusalem at the Greek Orthodox school, at the CMS College, and at the Zion English College where he read Literature.</font>
                <p>
                  <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#655658">In 1908, Sakakini traveled to the United Kingdom and from there to the United States to study education. However, he was unable to pursue his studies due to financial constraints and returned to Palestine in 1908. During his stay in America, he was active teaching Arabic, translating, and contributing to the Arabic literary magazines of the East Coast. Upon his return, he worked as a journalist for the Jerusalem newspaper Al Asmai' and taught Arabic at the renowned Jerusalem Salahiyya school, and to expatriates at the American Colony.</font>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#655658">
                    In 1909, he founded the Dusturiyyah school, which became known for its Arab nationalism. He pioneered a system he was to use later: there were no grades, prizes or punishments for students; and there was an emphasis on music education and athletics. 
                    <br>
                    Sakakini led a movement to reform and Arabize the Greek Orthodox Church in Palestine, and wrote a pamphlet in 1913 titled "The Orthodox Renaissance in Palestine", which led to his excommunication. Ottoman authorities arrested him in 1917 and jailed him in Damascus for sheltering a Jewish-Polish immigrant who was -unbeknownst to him- an American spy. After his release, he joined the ranks of the Arab Revolt, which anthem he wrote.

                <p>
                  <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#655658">In 1919 Khalil Sakakini went to work for the Educational Authority of Palestine in Jerusalem, and was appointed head of the Jerusalem Teachers’ College. He went on to be appointed Inspector for Education for Palestine, a post he held for twelve years, until his resignation in protest at the appointment of Herbert Samuel as High Commissioner in Palestine. At the same time, he wrote political commentaries for the newspapers Al Muqtataf, Al Hilal and Al Siyassa al Usbu`iyya, composed a number of patriotic poems, and spoke at political rallies. In 1925, Khalil Sakakini founded the Wataniyya school, and in 1938 the Nahda College in Jerusalem.</font>

                <p>
                  <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#655658">Khalil Sakakini's wife, Sultana, died in October 1939. He lived in consummate grief since, and wrote a number of poems eulogizing her. In 1948, a few days before the city was divided and its western part seized by the Israelis, the Sakakinis fled Jerusalem, one of the last Palestinian family to remain in the Qatamon quarter terrorized by Israeli mortar attacks. They left with only their personal effects, and sought refuge in Cairo where Sakakini was nominated by the Egyptian writer Taha Hussein to join the prestigious Arabic Language Academy. The sudden death of his son Sari in 1953 left him in poor health, and he died three months later on August 13, 1953. Sakakini had two daughters, Dumya and Hala, now living in Ramallah, and who have had long careers in education. Hala edited her father's journals published in 1955, and also wrote two memoirs in English: Jerusalem and I, and Twosome.</font>

                    Khalil Sakakini left 12 publications to his name, including educational works, poetry collections, literary, ethical and political essays, and a journal. Over seven books and essays have been published about him. 
                    <br>
                    A street and a school in Jerusalem were named after him, the Jazzar's mosque library in Acre, and a Cairo street. His papers are now at the Hebrew University. He is buried at the Mar Gerges Cemetery in Cairo, his house and the schools he ran are now under Israeli rule in West-Jerusalem, and have been converted to other purposes. 
                    <br>
                    The Sakakini Centre is in the fundraising process of gathering his personal diaries-which span 50 years of Palestinian history- in order to publish them in their entirety.
