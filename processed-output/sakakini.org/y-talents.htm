      <p>In September 1999 the Sakakini center sent 4 young Palestinian artists to Amman’s Darat al Funoun. This most prestigious visual arts organization in the Arab world ( see links section) organized to celebrate its 10 anniversary the first summer academy for young Arab artists, under the direction of Syrian artist Marwan Qassab-Bashi. Other countries participating were Jordan, Bahrain and Syria.</p>
      <p>The month long free style instruction covered etching, printing and drawing. A group exhibit was held at the end of the month. The Sakakini held in December an exhibit for the Palestinian participants: Mohammed Hawajri, Mohammed Abu Sill, Raed Issa and Rana Bishara. The works showed the clear progression and transformation in most of the participants’ work from traditionally symbolic works to more free and thoughtful works. Qassab-Bashi’s works also heavily influenced them, as most of the works produced during their stay were of his favorite subject matter: faces. Issa and Abu Sill concentrated on watercolors, Hawajri on oil and Bishara on mixed media.</p>
