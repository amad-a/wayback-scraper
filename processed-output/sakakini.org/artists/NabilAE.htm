        <font size="4">He privileges the medium in his approach towork. :&quot; In general, what represents for me the strongeststimulus, is the medium with which I work, added to it, a mix ofsensations that come form ancient memory, mixed with the presentand the past... How does it begin ?, a handful of henna thrown ona humid leather hide?, a horizontal line snaking its way onto anunusual surface ?, the dialogue continues until I am convincedthat this work is part of my personal plastic vision&quot;.</font>
