                  <FONT SIZE=+1>Since its opening in May 1996, the Sakakini functioned&nbsp;as a branch of the Palestinian Ministry of Culture, albeit with programmaticindependence. Within a year of its opening, consultations assessing theSakakini’s work recommended that in order for it to better fulfill itsmission and serve the local community, the Sakakini should change its statusto a non governmental organization (NGO).</FONT>
                  <P>
                    <FONT SIZE=+1>For that purpose, a founding board made up of local artistsand philanthropists was convened in July 1997,&nbsp; among its tasks wasthe drafting of&nbsp; bylaws and helping in&nbsp; fundraising. In May 1998,the Sakakini obtained its NGO registration from the Palestinian Ministryof the Interior, and a tax exempt status granted to non-profit organizationsfrom the Ministry of Finance. In August 1998, an agreement was signed withthe Ministry of Culture, whereby the Sakakini’s building remains the propertyof the Ministry, while its premises are used rent free by the new Sakakini-NGO.The first general assembly meeting is due to be convened in September.</FONT>
