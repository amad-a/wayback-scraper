                        The Sakakini received funding from the Ford Foundation for a two-year pilot program to nurture the visual arts. The program will benefit schoolchildren, government school art teachers, and young artists. The program became operational with the establishment of a new office wing at the Centre, and the hiring of a new employee, a visual arts coordinator- to handle all aspects of the Sakakini visual arts programs in general. School workshops began on February 2001. The program includes the following:

                        <li>Organizing school visits by local schools throughout the school year to visit Sakakini exhibits, and receive a free copy of exhibit catalogues. 5 out of 8 of the schools are government schools, three are co-ed., three are girls’ schools, and two are boys’ schools.</li>
                        <li>
                          Holding an art workshop for the students after each visit.

                        <br>
                        This project consists of the publishing the personal diaries of a leading Palestinian historical personality, and the centre's namesake, Khalil Sakakini (1878-1953). The project is based on 34 volumes of diaries, written almost daily between 1908 and 1952. The Sakakini is currently editing and footnoting the texts, as a step towards publishing and distributing them in their entirety. This project is conducted in co-operation with the Institute for Palestine Studies (IPS).

                        <br>
                        The Sakakini is finishing (December 2001) a project dealing with consequences of the Intifada: Four patchwork quilts of embroidery pieces stitched by the mothers of 156 Shaheed, in loving tribute to the lives of their sons and daughters. The project helps the mothers deal with their grief and to give it meaning, and it teaches the seamstresses assembling the pieces a new, and income-generating craft.

                        <br>
                        During Ramadan 2001, the Centre held solidarity Iftars for those who are suffering during the Intifada, such as the injured, students who live away from home, and low ranking soldiers who live outside their headquarters. The four evenings consisted of a break-the-fast meal, a concert, and the distribution of care packages. CNN aired a report about the activity

                        <br>
                        In the autumn of 2001, the Sakakini embarked on a "break the siege" project by conducting 3-4 monthly activities in the village of Birzeit, at Beit-Alhajar, a student meeting place and coffee shop. The activities in Birzeit are extremely popular with the students who flock to Beit-Alhajar to attend them

                        <br>
                        In the summer of 2001, the Sakakini organized in its garden a series of Open Summer Nights Concerts. These evenings showcased the talents of mainly amateur young artists, in poetry readings, sketches, singing, and Dabka. The evenings helped young artists become known, contributed to breaking the siege as many performers came from different villages and towns; and provided the large and diverse audience with an opportunity for family entertainment in a pleasant environment, in the middle of the strangulating conditions of siege.

                        An intensive creative writing project run by Libyan-American poet and creative writing professor Khaled Mattawa was held at the Sakakini in June 2000. The pilot project gathered twelve young writers and was made possible by funding from the US Consulate’s information office and the hospitality of the Qattan Foundation center. Besides helping young writers, the project was instrumental in identifying problems and opportunities in developing creative writing in Palestine. The Sakakini is currently developing follow up initiatives to establish a permanent creative writing program in Palestine.

                        “Behind the Checkpoint” is a documentary born out of the Aqsa Intifada, filming four very different Palestinians who each in his/her own distinct way symbolizes a facet of the Palestinian struggle.

                        This was a two-time experimental project undertaken with Ramallah's Dar-el-Amal, the only rehabilitation center in the West Bank for young offenders. The project consisted the first time of organizing a writing workshop using the life experiences of these young boys, that culminated in their writing a short play made up of skits depicting typical young men's lives in Palestine. The play titled "Hafla" (Party) was bursting with dance and music. Given the success of this project, a second project was started this time in co-operation with the Beit Sahour home for girls, also the only West Bank center for young female offenders. This time there were joint rehearsals between the girls and boys at the Sakakini, that also led to a the writing of a play titled "Moutheer" (Thriller) dealing with issues of love, marriage, criminality, etc.. The two workshops were led by Algerian-French playwright Mohammed Rwabhi, and funded by the Swiss agency pro-Helvetia.

                        1997 marked the 30th anniversary of the occupation of the West Bank &amp; Gaza, and 1998 the 50th anniversary of the Nakba. Because of the capital importance of these events on Palestinian history, present, lives, identity, culture and future; the Sakakini Center devoted the majority of its 1997 &amp; 1998 activities to these issues, in an exercise in dialogue and remembrance. The program featured:

                        <br>
                        The project calls for the establishment of a public sculpture studio in Ramallah, that will make available tools that are expensive to buy, as well as a dedicated space for sculpture now unavailable to the few practicing sculptors in Palestine, and the many would be sculptors. Due to the particular nature of sculpture work (need of a large space, noise, dirt) no Palestinian artist has the means to set himself up in a sculpture studio, despite the plentiful Jerusalem stone, and the importance of stone in Palestinian crafts history and heritage. The Sakakini hopes to foster through this Studio, artistic creativity in harmony with local artists’ natural environment, and to develop young and new talents in the arts. The Studio will be open to all that apply and who meet certain criteria, and they will be provided opportunities for training. There will be a focus in attracting young artists. The project also calls for the establishment of a sculpture focused video slides and book library, and the organization of a hands on initiation workshop at the start of the project with a prominent Arab sculptor, and finally, the sending a of a few sculptors abroad for arts residencies and studies.
