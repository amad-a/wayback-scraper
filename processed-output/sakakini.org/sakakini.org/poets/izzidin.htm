        <b>
          Dawn Visitors 
          <br></b>
         At the entries to capital cities I met him, 
        <dt>distracted and sad,</dt>
        <dt>a man with worry lines</dt>
        <dt>that weighed him down</dt>
        <dt>like a cypress tree, drooping and silent,</dt>
        <dt>despite the winds that ruffled him</dt>
        <dt>whispering in the evenings-</dt>
        <dt>
          but he would not answer the wind.. 
          <br>
        </dt>
        <dt>At the gates of capital cities-I cannot name them</dt>
        <dt>but I sing their Arabic names when troubles reign-</dt>
        <dt>I call on the capitals when shells are slaughtering my people's</dt>
        <dt>children. I call on them, I scream, but no one</dt>
        <dt>answers.</dt>
        <dt>They've all travelled west, and north. I wish</dt>
        <dt>they'd gone east, I wish</dt>
        <dt>they'd become stars in exile, servants to strangers.</dt>
        <dt>At harvest time they sang under the pine trees</dt>
        <dt>but none of the harvests was theirs..</dt>
        <dt>it is for those hard hearted men</dt>
        <dt>who owns the land of exile</dt>
        <dt>Don't bury me in any Arab capital, they've all tortured me</dt>
        <dt>for so long,</dt>
        <dt>giving me nothing but death and suffering and poverty</dt>
        <dt>and the martyred neighbors of my grave,</dt>
        <dt>those new kinsmen, for every stranger is kinsman to the stranger.</dt>
        <dt>No, don't bury me in any Arab capital</dt>
        <dt>
          at the mercy of this ordeal! 
          <br>
        </dt>
        <dt>At the gate of the capitals I met him</dt>
        <dt>his head forever bent,</dt>
        <dt>immortal as the earth of Hebron,</dt>
        <dt>proud as the mountains of Safad.</dt>
        <dt>
          He was soft like old wine when it steeps inside the body. 
          <br>
        </dt>
        <dt>I would have tempted the stars</dt>
        <dt>to accompany his beautiful departure,</dt>
        <dt>a star to guard him, and one lovely maiden</dt>
        <dt>to tend him forever.</dt>
