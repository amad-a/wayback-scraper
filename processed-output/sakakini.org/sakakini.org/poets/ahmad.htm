         Out of what lair did the earthly tyrants escape?
      </dt>
      <dl>
        <dt>Nero burned Rome twice, then composed a discordant tune</dt>
        <dt>he went on playing till the city sang with him.</dt>
        <dt>Holako who inherited that melody</dt>
        <dt>set fire</dt>
        <dt>to the world's library, the river ran</dt>
        <dt>with ink, and from the ashes was born</dt>
        <dt>the language of the locusts which rose</dt>
        <dt>to thank the madman.</dt>
        <dt>After the salutations to madness, Hitler came</dt>
        <dt>(..) but unable to be appeased,</dt>
        <dt>had to include the sea</dt>
        <dt>in his vital destruction,</dt>
        <dt>and war at sea, turmoil on land,</dt>
        <dt>
          combined in their angry conflagration. 
          <br>
        </dt>
        <dt>I too have seen a tyrant-</dt>
        <dt>whose power diminished the other three.</dt>
        <dt>he has committed every atrocity,</dt>
        <dt>and yet: in his day,</dt>
        <dt>there were five poets,</dt>
        <dt>
          who took to silence. 
          <br>
