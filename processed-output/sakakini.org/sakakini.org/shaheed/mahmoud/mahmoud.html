                <b>Mahmoud Al-Emwasi</b>
                <p>24 years old. Leaves behind his wife of two days, his parents, five brothers and two sisters. Mahmoud came from Emwas, a village destroyed in 1967. All of its inhabitants were forced to flee and the land has since been turned into a public park called Canada Park. Mahmoud would often visit the ruins of his village despite the various obstacles placed by Israel, obliging him to walk long distances to reach the place of his roots.</p>
                <p>He was active during the first Intifada and a bullet injured him when he was only eleven years old. The Israeli authorities arrested Mahmoud three times. He told his wife of how once when he lay injured, a collaborator took him to the hospital and denounced him to the Israelis, but his friends were able to take him home and get him treated there.</p>
                <p>Mahmoud felt devastated after his friend, Imad Anati died from wounds sustained in a demonstration. Mahmoud decided to attend Imad's funeral procession without telling anyone, and like Imad, was killed in the ensuing clashes on October 3rd.</p>

                  Mahmoud wanted to have two children: A boy they'd call Yasser after a friend of his, and a girl to be called Doumou' (tears). He had fallen in love with 17-year-old Maraam who had just returned to Palestine with her family from Syria. They married two days before he died. His wife has since returned to school. In the future, she'd like to become a journalist. Of her short-lived happiness with Mahmoud she says, "My new life as a bride was like a dream, and now I will return to my old life with a wounded heart."
