                    <b>By DAVAN MAHARAJ, Times Staff Writer</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>RAMALLAH, West Bank--Some visitors to the KhalilSakakini Cultural Center here come to see the tanhiking boots once worn by Mohammed Durra, the slain12-year-old whose picture--showing him cowering besidehis father--has become one of the most incendiaryimages of the 5 1/2-month-old intifada.</p>
                  <p>Others admire the roughly carved slingshot that15-year-old Fares Odeh used to fling stones at Israelitanks--until he took a fatal bullet in the neck.Or the unfinished piece of embroidery that RahmaHindi, 54, was working on before she was killed by anIsraeli missile.</p>
                  <p>The footwear, slingshot and stitchery are part ofan unusual exhibit of photographs and treasured itemsbelonging to the first 100 people killed by Israelisin the ongoing Palestinian uprising against rule bythe Jewish state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.The idea for the memorial exhibit was hatched inOctober when Palestinians were being killed in clashesalmost every day, their identities unknown to the vastmajority of their compatriots. Since the uprisingbroke out at the end of September, about 425 peoplehave been killed, 80% of them Palestinians.</p>
                  <p>Organizers say the exhibit, funded by the FordFoundation, is intended to help visitors see the deadas individuals, not mere statistics."We want people to get to know them, and we wantto give them back their individuality," said AdilaLaidi, director of the cultural center. "These peoplesacrificed their lives for independence. Why shouldthey remain anonymous?"</p>
                  <p>Many Palestinians are paying attention. Theexhibit, which opened in Ramallah in mid-February andwas expected to run for only two weeks, is now in itsfourth week thanks to hundreds of visitors. Organizersplan to take their show to six cities in the West Bankand Gaza Strip, then on to Jordan, Egypt and Europe.Some Israeli critics say the exhibit is part ofan effort to manipulate the memory of the dead andportray Israelis to the Western world aschild-killers.</p>
                  <p>Laidi defended the show, saying: "When many ofthese people died, their mothers, friends andrelatives did not have a chance to grieve. This givesthem an opportunity for closure."</p>
                  <p>The exhibition hall at the Sakakini centerusually hosts concerts, displays of elegant paintingsand Palestinian folk art. The noted Palestinian poetMahmoud Darwish maintains an office on the secondfloor.</p>
                  <p>But the center has been converted into a shrinefor this exhibit. Tea candles flicker on the barestone floor. Black-and-white photographs of the deadare mounted on the wall. Under each photo is atranslucent plastic box containing a belonging or two,each wrapped with twine like a present.</p>
                  <p>A GameBoy. A soccer ball. Tools. A perfumebottle. An empty bird cage. Crayon drawings of a boyflying a kite.</p>
                  <p>Descriptions of the dead are contained in a208-page catalog that Laidi and the staff of hernonprofit organization compiled. The stories, Laidisaid, bear witness to the Palestinian condition. Manylived in cramped and miserable refugee camps. Somewere so poor that they hadn't had their pictures takenin years, forcing the exhibit's curators to usewhatever pictures their families could muster.</p>
                  <p>Many died in clashes with soldiers. But there aremany exceptions. There's Harald Fischer, a German-bornchiropractor who was killed by an Israeli missile ashe tried to help neighbors. And Bassam Bilbeissi, anambulance driver who was slain as he tried to rescueDurra. Bilbeissi's paramedic uniform is part of theexhibit.</p>
                  <p>Chadi Barghouti, a Sakakini employee who gathereditems for the exhibit, said he left with stories evenmore precious.</p>
                  <p>
                    On the day that 15-year-old Nizar Eideh ofRamallah died in clashes with soldiers, he released abird he had bought three days earlier. Barghouti saidthe boy explained to his mother that he didn't wantthe bird's mother to miss him.
