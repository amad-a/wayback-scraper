                  This project was conceptualized as a way to pay tribute to the fallen ofthe Aqsa Intifada, the uprising that began in Jerusalem on September29th, 2000. The idea was to shine a beacon of light onto the deathsurrounding us, to break the mind-numbing anonymity of daily deathcounts, and to honor the families who must live with the absence oftheir loved ones and the injustice of their parting. 
                  <p>It seemed that the most humane way to honor the Shuhada is to celebratetheir lives, with love and dignity. To try to see them as human beings -a boy, a teenager, a young man, a father, a grandfather, a grandmother.To try to feel what their lives encompassed, understanding their realityand dreams through an anecdote, a toy, or a photograph. The banality andfragility of each object helps us retrace a life, intact.</p>
                  <p>Etymologically, a Shaheed is also a “faithful witness”. Thus, thereading of each life compellingly bears witness to a whole greater thanthe sum of the 100 biographies: An eloquent testimony to what it meansto be a Palestinian. A condition transcending and determining the courseof each life</p>
                  <p>The Shuhada, regardless of age, background or geographic origin, sharedthe reality of lives shackled by occupation. This starts with a family’sloss and uprooting in the Nakba. It continues with the subsequent deniedopportunities, and miseries of a refugee’s condition. It progresses witha litany of deprivation, servitude, interrupted childhoods, Odysseanlike exiles, house demolitions, killings, injuries, and imprisonements.Even those whose lives appear removed from the yoke of occupation,succumbed to its reach with the premature timing and brutalcircumstances of their deaths.</p>
                  <p>
                    Yet, these lives also incarnate the irrepressible human longing forfreedom, and the indomitable spirit of struggle. We hope that one day wecan go beyond honoring our dead, to live, as they should have been ableto: Free.
