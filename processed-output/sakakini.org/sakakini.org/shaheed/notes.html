                  This project was conceptualized in mid October 2000. With the project'sinitial idea, the memorial exhibit and accompanying catalogue wereenvisioned to be life-affirming, minimalist in nature, and to primarilyaddress the visual and emotional senses. Further, since one of theproject's goals was to give back each Shaheed his/her individuality, afew governing principles for the realization of the exhibit andcatalogue were set from the start. 
                  <p>First, each Shaheed would have his/her own personal space, featuringhis/her name, photograph and personal object. The Shuhada would also bepresented by order of age. The objects and photographs would speak forthemselves, on their own terms, going beyond death to recreate a life;without the clutter of text or obtrusive display devices. Artist SamirSalameh was remarkably successful in fusing all these concepts into aunified design for the exhibit, in a matter of only two weeks. He usedunobtrusive and individualized translucent plastic display cases foreach Shaheed. Above each one floats a transparent sheet of paper bearingthe name, and a small black and white photograph of the Shaheed. Toemphasize the sanctity of the objects displayed, he carefully wrappedthe objects, tying them with a ribbon of twine.</p>
                  <p>At the same time, artist Sharif Waked conceptualized the catalogue'sdesign, whereby each Shaheed was allocated two pages, between them atransparent page covering the Shaheed’s face, echoing the exhibit'sdisplay cases. To deal with the multiplicity of colors of the personalobjects and photographs, photographer Isabel de la Cruz decided tophotograph the objects in sepia, which subsequently became the unifyingcolor scheme of the entire catalogue. She also pre-selected the objectsdisplayed from the many objects each family provided. Curator SamirSalameh made the final selection.</p>
                  <p>Initially, it was planned to include all the Shuhada of the Intifada inthis memorial. Sadly, it quickly became clear that the Palestinian deathtoll would only continue to rise. It was, therefore, decided to limitthe scope of this tribute to the first 100 Shaheed. The fallen representall geographic areas of the country, including Jerusalem, the West Bankand Gaza Strip, as well as Palestinian populated areas within Israel.</p>
                  <p>Then, each of the Shuhada’s families received a personal letter,outlining the project's aims and a varied list of personal objectsneeded. We are grateful to the Ministry of Social Affairs’ GeneralDirectorate of Shuhada affairs, and to its field offices, for providingus with a list of the Shuhada, and for diligently contacting themajority of the families to obtain the information and objects. Inaddition, the Sakakini Centre hired a number of field workers to collectcomplementary information in a few hard to reach areas.</p>
                  <p>The preparation stage of the project was to have taken a month, but infact lasted more than three months and a half, due to the encirclementof Palestinian towns and villages, which made reaching the families ofeach Shaheed almost impossible. In addition to the siege, the griefsuffered by the families further made the personal informationcollection more arduous. This part of the preparation work was the mosttime consuming of the whole process, as new information, stories, andanecdotes were constantly sought out, gathered, added, verified forconsistency and accuracy, edited, translated, etc.. Yet, there stillremains Shuhada whose biographical information remains brief. We hope tocomplete it at a later stage, as this is a work in progress.</p>
                  <p>This memorial will be on display in seven Palestinian cities. It openedto the public at Ramallah’s Sakakini Centre on February 20th, 2001. Aspecial visiting day was set aside for the families of the Shuhada. Weare still waiting to see whether the siege will allow the exhibit to beseen in Bethlehem, Gaza City, Hebron, Jerusalem, Nablus, and Nazareth.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, we hope that when the Aqsa Intifada ends, this memorial exhibitwill be enlarged to include the remaining Shuhada and installed in apermanent locale, serving as an enduring tribute to the fallen. Beyondcurrent limitations, this memorial is a symbolic tribute to allPalestinians who have lost their lives in the quest for freedom.</p>
