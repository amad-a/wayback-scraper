      The Centre hosted the&nbsp; exhibit of Syrian artist Marwan Qassab Bashi.Marwan is one of the most important Arab artists working today, and enjoysgreat fame in Europe. This exhibit,&nbsp; organized in cooperation withthe Ramallah Goethe Institut, was held as a result of&nbsp; Marwan’s wishto donate&nbsp; to&nbsp; “the children of Palestine” a collection of 75etchings of great value on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of theNakba. These were distributed between the Sakakini and Bir Zeit University. 
      <p>Professor Jorn Merkert, director of the Berlin Museum of Modern Artand chief expert on Marwan's work, attended the opening, commented a shortdocumentary film on Marwan after the opening, and gave a lecture and slideshow at the Bir Zeit opening.</p>
      <p>This important gestures underscores the solidarity of internationalartists with the struggle of the Palestinian people, and the gift willserve as the nucleus for a museum of contemporary art works donated byinternational&nbsp; artists, in solidarity with the people of Palestine,that the Sakakini will try to establish in Ramallah.</p>
      <p>The exhibit featured mainly prints and etchings that showcased the mostimportant phases of Marwan’s career: faces, people standing, face-landscapes,marionettes, etc.. The donation also featured a number of unique prints(1/1) and&nbsp; watercolors. The exhibit’s poster was also a rare limitededition signed serigraphy.</p>
