      This show is the fruit of a collaboration between Boullata &amp; theSyro-Lebanese poet Adonis. After a joint 1995 visit to the Alhambra, Adoniswrote a poem in homage to Granada, &amp; Boullata executed 12 serigraphs(silk screens) echoing the architectural motifs &amp; colors of the Alhambra,also following up on his two-year research into geometric patterns in Islamicart in Morocco and Spain. 
      <p>With the support of the UNESCO, 50 linen &amp; wood hand-crafted casescontaining the serigraphs &amp; 2 books of Adonis' poem were made, &amp;distributed to selected heads of state &amp; art institutions around theworld. The books are of an accordion format, &amp; feature 3-dimensionalcarved pop-ups echoing some architectural motifs of the Alhambra (a pictureof the book can be seen in the Sakakini October 98 News section).</p>
      <p>
        The serigraphs are divided into 3 triptychs, each named for one of the4 rivers believed to exist in Paradise, 2 of which were named after springsin Palestine (Bisan and Jaihun). The 4-river motif is also found in theLions’ Courtyard of the Alhambra.

        This exhibit -viewed for the first time after its 1998 Alhambra opening-&nbsp;is made possible by the UNESCO's donation of all the works exhibited tothe Sakakini. We hope to display the series the near future in a permanentgallery, along with other works of art donated to the Centre.
