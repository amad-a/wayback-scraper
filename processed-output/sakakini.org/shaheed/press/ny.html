                    AMALLAH, West Bank, Feb. 19 — In one translucent plastic box, there is a single sock, recovered by the widow of 25-year-old Bilal Affaneh after he was shot dead by Israeli forces outside the Aksa Mosque in Jerusalem last September.
                  </p>
                  <p>It is tied up like a gift, with twine for a ribbon.</p>
                  <p>In another box, another totem: pint-sized Fares Odeh's rough-hewn slingshot. It flung its last rock at an Israeli tank on Nov. 8, when the 15- year-old boy took a bullet in the neck.</p>
                  <p>The Sakakini Cultural Center here has been converted into a spare, somber shrine to the first 100 Palestinians killed in the uprising that began in late September. Each life is summed up by one or two objects, selected by the family and wrapped into a tidy bundle, boxed and mounted beneath a photograph of the deceased. The curator is a French-Palestinian artist, Samir Salameh.</p>
                  <p>"I didn't want to entomb the martyrs," Mr. Salameh said in French, looking more Rive Gauche than West Bank. "The clear boxes are like windows into their souls. The objects are banal but they are made precious by those who died. They are wrapped because the people gave their lives like a present to their country."</p>
                  <p>Encased on the gallery's stone walls are book bags, soccer balls, boxing gloves, Gameboys, prayer shawls, teacups, wedding pictures and water pipes. Seventeen-year-old Sami Balawneh is represented by his Israeli security clearance card, expiration date: May 19, 2001. He was killed last October.</p>
                  <p>Israeli critics would say that the exhibit, "100 Martyrs — 100 Lives," glorifies death and encourages the cult of the shaheed, or martyr. But Adila Laidi, the cultural center's director, said that she feared death was so routine that the dead were becoming "dismissable statistics."</p>
                  <p>Ms. Laidi said that she intentionally focused on the lives of those who were killed rather than on their deaths. In fact, she said, she declined to include the photograph of one young man because it was taken during his autopsy.</p>
                  <p>"Can you imagine that the only picture ever taken of this poor boy showed the entrance wound for the bullet that killed him?" she asked.</p>
                  <p>After four months of violence, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has come again, inescapably, to define life in the West Bank and Gaza. Some Palestinians are angry, some are depressed and some are numb.</p>
                  <p>They continue to endorse the uprising, including attacks on Israel. Support for Hamas, the Islamic militant group, is increasing. But the intifada is also wearing people down. In a recent Bir Zeit University poll, some 75 percent of Palestinian respondents reported psychological and emotional difficulties as a result of "economic and political hardships."</p>
                  <p>In one telling indication of the desperate economic situation, one-third of Gazan respondents said they were forced to sell their wives' dowry or wedding gifts to feed their families.</p>
                  <p>Those who have died in the intifada have always occupied a special place in Palestinian society; their families receive monthly checks from the social welfare ministry that is run by Minister Um Jihad. (Her name means Mother of Jihad, or Holy War).</p>
                  <p>Lately some of those checks have been bouncing because of the Palestinian Authority's crushing fiscal problems. But the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, has more than compensated for the bad checks with one-time payments of $10,000 to the families.</p>
                  <p>Last fall, some of the first Palestinians killed became household names, their pictures plastered on town walls, their deaths memorialized in Egyptian pop songs.</p>
                  <p>Mohammed al-Durra, a 12-year- old boy represented here by his worn tennis shoe, became the leading example, after his killing was captured on videotape and broadcast around the world.</p>
                  <p>But as the Palestinian death toll climbs past 370, that level of attention has not been sustained.</p>
                  <p>That is why Halimeh Nabrissi, the aunt of 21-year-old Ahmad Nabrissi, who was killed in October, welcomed the cultural center's memorial, which includes Israeli Arabs killed by the Israeli police inside Israel.</p>
                  <p>"This way the families know that their sons are still alive in the minds of the people, that the people value what they have done, and that they didn't die in vain," she said in a telephone interview from her Nablus home.</p>
                  <p>Samir Maslamani of Jerusalem lent the exhibit a safari-style vest that his 15-year-old son, Madje, used to wear. "If you ask me to close my eyes and describe him, he is wearing that vest and eating maybe chocolates or a biscuit," Mr. Maslamani said in a telephone interview. "It's not a painful thought. I feel proud. This was Majde's destiny, and I couldn't intervene."</p>
                  <p>Another youth, Nizar Eideh, is memorialized by an empty bird cage. On the morning before Nizar was killed, he released his bird so that it could fly back to its mother, his family said. Then, ignoring his mother's pleading, he headed toward the site of clashes with Israeli troops in Ramallah.</p>
                  <p>"God will protect me," he said.</p>
                  <p>Putting last-minute touches on the exhibit, Mr. Salameh worked to arrange the cage just so, and to position the boy's picture beside it in an evocative manner. Inside this restored Palestinian villa, the cage was a long way from the boy's refugee camp home — just as the elegantly mounted exhibit was far from the messy clashes that took the lives being memorialized.</p>
                  <p>The promoters hope to turn the exhibit into a pilgrimage site, and the cultural center, with its graceful arches, high ceilings and recessed lighting, into a kind of temple of reflection. Indeed, the effect of these objects, all tied up into neat little packages, is wrenching; it contrasts so sharply with the chaotic violence that ended the encapsulated lives.</p>
                  <p>Among the larger objects that don't fit into the clear plastic boxes is a boy's bicycle with a plump red stuffed heart between the handlebars that says in English, "I love you this much." Yazan Halayqa, a 14- year-old from Bethlehem who was killed on Nov. 2, used to ride that bike everywhere.</p>
                  <p>"It was his best friend," said his father, Muhammad Halayqa.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Halayqa, who owns several quarries and lives in a grand house, said that his son's presence in the exhibit demonstrates that it is not only poor youths with nothing to lose who are willing to put their lives on the line.</p>
                  <p>"What can I say?" he said. "It's like I lost a part of my liver with this boy. But everybody's saying that only the sons of poor people die, and it's good for them to know that also those of rich people do. The intifada is for all Palestinians."</p>
