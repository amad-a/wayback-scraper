The Lemon smell, Moonlight, and saltiness of its sea&#133; This is Jericho which allows you to penetrate into a journey of ten thousands years ago on a bicycle that you ride in its old streets while all of your senses are completely provoked because of the Lemon smell and plush-pink colored mountains, voices of frogs and beetles around its agricultural lakes and wheat fields.</b></p>
<p><b>The bigger sized moon in Jericho is more than anywhere else so it was called &quot; the City of Moon&quot; The river that passes by its eastern side is holier than any other river as far as Jesus Christ was baptized, The sea which surrounds its southern side is the saltier than any other sea worldwide so it was called the Dead Sea, Its Human Civilization on Earth, this secret is still completely unknown the same as the secret of choosing one of its mountain's caves by Jesus Christ to fast in there and resist the Devil, its was repeatedly said by old people that this secret is concealed to sweet fresh water of its spring which the Holy book indicates it was bitter before one of Jesus Christ virtuous followers washed himself up in it.</b></p>
<p><b>Because of its spring's fresh water, because of the saltiness of its sea, because of its warm winter, because of the lemon smell, the Orange and Banana's smell which is mixed with the desert sand smell and the shadow of the huge trees here and there&#133; and after all those elements were created by a powerful, Experienced hand (GOD'S Hand), Jericho was formulated even though you could smell one of those elements when its name is mentioned in front of you even if you were hundreds or thousands miles a way.</b></p>
