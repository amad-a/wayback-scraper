      On Thursday night, as we huddled around radio news reports, we heard there were tanks surrounding Ramallah. Today, we saw them. This photo is of a tank moving into position on the hill above Ramallah, kicking up clouds of dust. There's an old street fighters' proverb that says, "Don't pull a knife unless you are prepared to use it." Although Netanyahu clearly wanted to engage in a bit of territorial swaggering, it didn't seem that impossible to us on this side of it's cannon that he would be stupid enough to use them. The feeling that war had been declared through this escalation of weaponry was undoubtedly in the air. A little unnecessary when you consider that the only weapons Palestinian police have are AK-47's, each with 30 bullets.

      An Israeli tank overlooks Ramallah skyline. Were the tanks to roll into Ramallah there would be a massacre. I am willing to bet real money that the soldiers and population here would throw stones at the tanks if they had nothing else. People wouldn't stay in their homes passively while Israel reoccupied the town. There would 
      <i>have</i>
       to be a massacre.

      Above an ancient wall, the barrel of a tank's cannon points directly down at Ramallah. Many more surrounded Ramallah and other Palestinian towns.
