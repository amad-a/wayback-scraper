    <h3>Update: Saturday September 28, 1996</h3>
    <p>
      <b>The Health Development Information Program</b>
       issued an urgentappeal on September 28, 1996, in which the following wasstated:
    </p>
    <p>Since clashes between Palestinians and Israeli militaryforces began on September 25, 1996 there have beencontinuous violations of medical neutrality by the Israeliarmy. Medical personnel have come under attack, and thesick and wounded have had their access to medical caredeliberately restricted.</p>
    <p>In one of the most serious cases, a 27 year old nurse,Bassil Naem, who worked in the delivery suite at A-ShifaHospital in Gaza City, was shot and killed by Israelisoldiers on September 26. A number of medical personnelhave received injuries whilst trying to administer medicalcare at the scenes of the recent violence. Dr. MustafaBarghouthi, President of the Union of Palestinian MedicalRelief committees, was shot while administering emergencytreatment to someone suffering severe injuries and bleeding.Dr. Barghouthi received injuries to the back, shoulder, andface, from a high velocity sniper's bullet, despite beingclearly visible in a doctor's white coat. Dr. Barghouthireceived treatment in Ramallah hospital and was laterdischarged. One health professional was shot whileattending to someone inside an ambulance. Israeli soldierswere clearly trying to prevent the wounded from receivingmedical assistance.</p>
    <p>Among other health workers injured are Mohammed Al Nimnim, a40 year old ambulance driver from Gaza who received bulletwounds; Mohammed Imad, an operating theater nurse from Gaza;Mohammed A-Shemali, 40 years old, a staff member of RamallahHospital who was shot in the left leg; and Aamar AhmedKhalil Da'as, a 22 year old ambulance driver working withthe Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Al-Bireh.</p>
    <p>Many of those with injuries were unable to receive promptmedical treatment because the Israeli army restricted themovement of ambulances carrying life saving equipment andpersonnel to the sites of the clashes. In addition, thosenot injured during the conflict itself have also become thetarget of Israeli aggression. Najat Mustafa Mohammed Musafrom Burin was in advanced labor and trying to reach ahospital in Nablus when she arrived at an Israelicheckpoint. Israeli soldiers detained her at the checkpointfor several hours, refusing her admission to Nablus. As aresult she delivered her child in a car beside thecheckpoint without appropriate medical supervision.</p>
    <p>Earlier today two cars carrying urgently needed medicalsupplies were trying to reach the northern West Bank. Thecars were stopped by Israeli military personnel at Beit Eland near Jalazon refugee camp, and the medical supplies wereremoved from the cars.</p>

The European foreign ministerscalled on both parties to show restraint and also demandedthat Israel reconsider its position in opening the tunnelthat caused the recent confrontations. The European Unionstatement also called on Israel to lift the closure imposedon Palestinian territories and to start redeployment fromHebron.

            <h3>Friday October 4, 1996</h3>
            <p>Israel deployed over 3,000 soldiers and police near the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem andstopped many Palestinians from entering. Hundreds ofPalestinians were arrested throughout the cities andvillages of the Palestinian territories duringconfrontations, which continued sporadically throughout theday.</p>
            <p>Israel reintroduced a strict closure over the Palestinianterritories, this time adding an �internal closure,� wherebyself-rule Palestinians cannot move from one town to another.A curfew Israel clamped on Hebron during the second day ofclashes remains in force.</p>
            <p>Israel today stated that the PA�s use of live ammunitionagainst Israeli troops is also a "severe violation of thePeace agreements". However, it is difficult to find abasis for such statements. The recent violent clashesbetween Palestinians and Israeli forces were the firstdirect engagement between the two sides since the signing ofthe Oslo Accords. However, provision was made in theInterim Agreement for such an eventuality. The followingexerpts of the Interim Agreement were taken from today�sissue of the Palestine Report, a weekly publication of theJerusalem Media and Communication Center:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <h4>Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreements on the West Bank andthe Gaza Strip: September 28, 1995</h4>

              </p>
              <p>a. For the purpose of this Article, �engagement� shallmean an immediate response to an act or an incidentconstituting a danger to life or property that is aimed atpreventing or terminating such an act or incident, or atapprehending its perpetrators.</p>
              <p>b. Within the territory under the security responsibilityof the Palestinian Council, in places where Israeliauthorities exercise their security functions in accordancewith this Annex and in their immediate vicinities, theIsraeli authorities may carry out engagement steps in caseswhere an act or incident requires such action. In suchcases, the Israeli authorities will take any measuresnecessary to bring to an end such an act or incident with aview to transferring, at the earliest opportunity, thecontinued handling of the incident falling within thePalestinian responsibility to the Palestinian Police. ThePalestinian Police will immediately be notified, through therelevant DCO, of such engagement steps.</p>

          <p>In the early hours of 26 September 1996 the Israeliauthorities imposed a military siege on the towns andvillages of the West Bank by declaring Area C (Palestiniancontrolled areas) to be a closed military areas. Area C isabout 70 per cent of the entire area of the West Bank andits closure consequently isolates all Palestinian populationcenters, regardless of whether they are located in Areas A,B, or C. The siege is still in effect.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Economic and Agricultural Losses:</b>
          </p>
          <p>According to the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture, theagricultural sector lost at least 1.5 million US dollars perday from the combined effects of the internal siege and thestrict closure of Israel and Jerusalem from the rest of theWest Bank and from the Gaza Strip. According to thePalestine General Federation of Trade Unions, the closure ofIsrael and Jerusalem prevented 32,000 workers fromproceeding to their work (17,000 from the Gaza Strip and15,000 from the West Bank). In addition, 20,000Palestinians who normally work illegally inside Israel andJerusalem were also unemployed. During the current periodof closure and siege the rate of unemployment is estimatedto have risen to 70% in the Gaza Strip and 55% in the WestBank. The PGFTU has also quantified the total losses to thePalestinian economy caused by the siege and closure asamounting to about 10 million US dollars per day.</p>
          <p>Al Haq will report on the exact sequence of events and finalstatistics will be published in a longer report to be issuedby al-Haq in the coming few days.</p>
