      <h2>JOINT PRESS RELEASE</h2>
      <h3>PALESTINIANS SUFFER FROM THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF ISRAEL'S TOTAL MILITARY SIEGE ON THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES</h3>
    </center>
    <h3>1 October 1996, For Immediate Release</h3>
    <p>The undersigned Palestinian human rights and non-governmental organizations are gravely concerned by the deteriorating human rights situation in the Occupied Territories of the West Bank and theGaza Strip. In addition to the Israeli military authorities' use ofexcessive force in the last few days, resulting in the deaths of 60Palestinians, including 10 children, and at least 1,600 injuredpersons, the Israeli authorities have imposed a military siege on thetowns and villages of the West Bank.</p>
    <p>The Israeli authorities haveisolated Palestinian towns and villages in the West Bank by declaringArea C to be a closed military area. Area C is about 70 per cent of thetotal area of the West Bank and its closure consequently isolates allPalestinian population centers, whether they are located in Areas A, B,or C. This action places Palestinian residents in a situation similarto town arrest. Restrictions on movement have also been imposed withinthe Gaza Strip.</p>
    <p>Some areas are completely isolated as a result of thesiege. In addition, the complete closure of East Jerusalem, imposed inJanuary 1991 and intensified in March 1993, continues to prohibitPalestinians from the Gaza Strip and the rest of the West Bank fromentering Israel and Jerusalem. On 30 September 1996, the Israel DefenseForces stated that Israeli journalists were prohibited from enteringArea A, which is under the control of the Palestinian NationalAuthority. The Israeli authorities announced yesterday that they haveintroduced a permit system for internal travel within the West Bank.</p>
    <p>The siege imposed has had detrimental effects on the life of the residents of the area. The following is a summary of the main areas ofconcern:</p>
    <p>
      <b>Health and medical treatment:</b>
       Reports indicate that shortages of medical supplies are already emerging. Ambulances and medical personnel have been prevented from moving freely from one area toanother, especially to major clinics and hospitals located in the maintowns and cities of the West Bank. Patients are also prohibited fromleaving their places of residence to enter areas where medicalfacilities are located, and from entering hospitals inside Israel wherethey receive treatment. Preliminary documentation reveals that at leastseven women have been restricted from proceeding freely to hospitals togive birth. Medical supplies are also not reaching pharmacies andhospitals, particularly since the main sources of pharmaceuticals arelocated in the main towns of the West Bank, and exchange of goodswithin the West Bank is very difficult. Medical personnel areexpressing deep concern over the rapidly deteriorating health situationand potential emergence of new problems and health complications. Thesituation is particularly acute since more than 1,600 persons in thedifferent parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have been injuredin the current violence and are currently receiving medical treatment.Further, 14 patients from the Gaza Strip were prohibited on 29September 1996 from leaving the Gaza Strip to receive medical treatmentin Israel and Jerusalem. They were delayed for more than two hours atErez checkpoint by the Israeli forces, and were eventually turned back.Shortages in baby milk have also started to appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The economy and agriculture:</b>
       The closure has also affected the economy and has severely disrupted normal life in the West Bank. The agricultural sector is suffering since many farmers and theirworkers are not able to reach their fields. This is expected to haveserious effects on crops that are in season. There is particularconcern about the olive crop, which has just come into season. Thesiege also prevents farmers from marketing their produce outside theirown place of residence, causing them economic hardship. As a result,there are shortages of fresh basic produce in the main towns,particularly since produce from the north of the West Bank and Jerichoarea are the main sources of supply for the rest of the West Bank.Workers are also generally not able to reach their places of workinside the West Bank. In addition more than 50,000 Palestinians areprevented from reaching their places of work in Israel and Jerusalem.Since 26 September 1996, the Israeli authorities have prohibitedPalestinian fishermen in Rafah, Khan Younis and areas surrounding GushKatif from access to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Education:</b>
       The closure is also disrupting education, particularly sinceit is common for students and teachers to attend or teach in schools invillages and towns other than those where they live.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Prisoners in Israeli Jails:</b>
       Family visits to the more than 3,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons and detention centers are alsocanceled now until further notice because of the siege.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Disruption of the Work of the Palestinian Courts and Lawyers:</b>
       Normalinternal legal proceedings in the West Bank are paralyzed. The militarysiege has prevented court employees, including members of thejudiciary, from reaching their places of work in Area A. In additionlawyers cannot reach their clients or represent them in the courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Curfew:</b>
       A strict curfew has been in effect since 27 September 1996 onHebron city and the nearby villages of 'Aroub and Beit Ommar. Parts ofHalhoul in Hebron district were also placed under curfew in the earlyhours of Saturday 28 September 1996. Baqa al-Sharqeya in Tulkaremdistrict is under curfew for the fifth consecutive day. Hizma inJerusalem district is under curfew for the third day. The curfew waslifted on Hebron for four hours on Sunday commencing at 4:00 a.m. Thiswas relatively useless for residents as they could not purchase theneeded supplies. The curfew was lifted again in Hebron city yesterdaymorning for three hours from 5:00 a.m. As of yesterday evening,'Einabous and Howwara near Nablus were also under curfew.
    </p>
    <p>In addition, there is a heavy Israeli military presence of personnel,arms, jeeps, tanks and armored personnel carriers, at the entrances ofthe main towns, particularly Hebron, Nablus, Jenin, Ramallah,Bethlehem, and in the Gaza Strip. The latest statements by Israeliofficials, particularly by Mr. Netanyahu, and the unusual increase ofthe Israeli military presence is alarming. It causes fear that furthermilitary operations against Palestinians may take place any minute.</p>
    <p>
      The isolation of Palestinian towns and villages in the West Bank wasfirst imposed by the Israeli military authorities in March 1996.Instead of the Israeli-Palestinian Agreements being used as a means offurthering the prospects of peace, its provisions, particularly thoseconcerning the division of the West Bank into enclaves, have been usedby the Israeli authorities as an instrument of control. The siege is inclear violation of the Israeli-Palestinian Agreement, particularlyArticle XXI(8), which emphasizes that 
      <blockquote>"the West Bank and the Gaza Strip[are] a single territorial unit, the integrity and status of which willbe preserved during the interim period."</blockquote>
       The closure and restrictionson movement are measures of collective punishment in clear violation ofArticle 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention Relative to the Protectionof Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949.
    </p>
    <p>The continuation of the siege, and the other measures imposed by the Israeli authorities, such as curfews and heavy deployment of Israeli military personnel and tanks outside the main towns increasestension. Military helicopters are still roaming over the area. In thepast, the undersigned human rights and civil society organizations havewarned of the consequences of such measures, which in fact provokefurther confrontations. Israel must be held fully responsible for anyconsequences and deterioration in the human rights situation that mayresult. The undersigned organizations call on the internationalcommunity of states and on international and local non-governmentalorganizations to intervene with the Israeli authorities immediatelydemanding:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the immediate lifting of measures restricting movement imposed in theWest Bank and the Gaza Strip, including the lifting of the currentsiege and general closure; 
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
          a refraining from any unilateral measuressuch as house demolition, settlement expansion, land confiscation,detention and torture, which are illegal and attempt to change thestatus and character of the West Bank, particularly Jerusalem, and theGaza Strip. In particular it should be demanded that Israel shouldclose the Western Wall Tunnel in Jerusalem immediately; 
          <br>
          <br>
          <li>
            full respectby Israel for its obligations under the Israeli-Palestinian agreements;the immediate cancellation of all Israeli policies and measuresdesigned to create facts on the ground which prejudice and pre-empt theoutcome of the Israeli-Palestinian final status negotiations.
          </ul>
          <p>The international community is also responsible for ensuring the fullprotection and security of Palestinian civilians in the currentsituation.</p>
