                      </a>

                      Zakah does not only purify the property of the contributor but also purifies hisheart from selfishness and greed. 
                      <br>

                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Although Islam does not hinder private enterprise or condemn privatepossessions, it does not tolerate selfish and greedy capitalism. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Islam adopts a moderate but positive and effective course between individualand society, between the citizen and the state, between capitalism andsocialism, between materialism and spiritualism.

                      Taxes paid to the government do not substitute for this religious duty.Contributor should not seek pride or fame, but if disclosing his name and hiscontribution is likely to encourage others, it is acceptable to do so.

                      <br>
                      Peace is the dominant theme. Peace with God, with one's soul, with oneanother, with all living creatures. To disturb the peace of anyone or any creaturein any shape or form is strictly prohibited. 
                      <br>

                      Muslims from all walks of life, from every corner of the globe assemble in Meccain response to the call of God. There is no royalty but loyalty of all to God, thecreator. 
                      <br>
                      <br>

                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Muslims go to Mecca in glory of God, not to worship a man. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      The visit of the tomb of the Prophet Muhammad at Madena is highlyrecommended but not essential in making the Hajj valid and complete.
