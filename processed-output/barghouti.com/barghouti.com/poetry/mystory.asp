<title>My Story</title>

<h1>My Story</h1> 
<br>
<br>
<font size="+1">
My destiny is to be lost in life<br>
Without your love my days are bitter<br>
So cure my heart and come back with my happiness<br>
For my soul lives in agony everyday<br>
Do I blame my heart for loving you?<br>
Or my soul? And how can I blame it?!<br>
I intuitively knew love from you<br>
And I see our hearts going towards their goals<br>
They fall in love because of emotions<br>
And it is hard to understand their actions<br>
I thought love was sweet in my mouth<br>
But I found how bitter this sweetness is<br>
A lover? Or this is only my wide imagination<br>
That lives off of misery if her image disappears<br>
A friend? Is this why I fly in happiness<br>
In yearning and love when her name is mentioned?!<br>
My tortured heart is my sole problem<br>
And my soul will not be cured without her words<br>
Will I lose my life in the moment<br>
When her verdict is "NO"?!<br>
What should my heart do<br>
While my soul yearns to achieve its dream?<br>
O Lord! This is my story<br>
So give my soul patience from its pain<br>
