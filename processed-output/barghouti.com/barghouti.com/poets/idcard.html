      <h1>Identity Card</h1>
      <i>Mahmoud Darwish - 1964</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">
        Record! 
        <br>
        I am an Arab 
        <br>
        And my identity card is number fifty thousand 
        <br>
        I have eight children 
        <br>
        And the nineth is coming after a summer 
        <br>
        Will you be angry? 
        <br>
        <br>
        Record! 
        <br>
        I am an Arab 
        <br>
        Employed with fellow workers at a quarry 
        <br>
        I have eight children 
        <br>
        I get them bread 
        <br>
        Garments and books 
        <br>
        from the rocks.. 
        <br>
        I do not supplicate charity at your doors 
        <br>
        Nor do I belittle myself at the footsteps of your chamber 
        <br>
        So will you be angry? 
        <br>
        <br>
        Record! 
        <br>
        I am an Arab 
        <br>
        I have a name without a title 
        <br>
        Patient in a country 
        <br>
        Where people are enraged 
        <br>
        My roots 
        <br>
        Were entrenched before the birth of time 
        <br>
        And before the opening of the eras 
        <br>
        Before the pines, and the olive trees 
        <br>
        And before the grass grew 
        <br>
        <br>
        My father..descends from the family of the plow 
        <br>
        Not from a privileged class 
        <br>
        And my grandfather..was a farmer 
        <br>
        Neither well-bred, nor well-born! 
        <br>
        Teaches me the pride of the sun 
        <br>
        Before teaching me how to read 
        <br>
        And my houseis like a watchman's hut 
        <br>
        Made of branches and cane 
        <br>
        Are you satisfied with my status? 
        <br>
        I have a name without a title! 
        <br>
        <br>
        Record! 
        <br>
        I am an Arab 
        <br>
        You have stolen the orchardsof my ancestors 
        <br>
        And the landwhich I cultivated 
        <br>
        Along with my children 
        <br>
        And you left nothing for us 
        <br>
        Except for these rocks.. 
        <br>
        So will the State take them 
        <br>
        As it has been said?! 
        <br>
        <br>
        Therefore! 
        <br>
        Record on the top of the first page: 
        <br>
        I do not hate poeple 
        <br>
        Nor do I encroach 
        <br>
        But if I become hungry 
        <br>
        The usurper's flesh will be my food 
        <br>
        Beware.. 
        <br>
        Beware.. 
        <br>
        Of my hunger 
        <br>
        And my anger!
