      <br>

      <font size="+1">
        My destiny is to be lost in life 
        <br>
        Without your love my days are bitter 
        <br>
        So cure my heart and come back with my happiness 
        <br>
        For my soul lives in agony everyday 
        <br>
        Do I blame my heart for loving you? 
        <br>
        Or my soul? And how can I blame it?! 
        <br>
        I intuitively knew love from you 
        <br>
        And I see our hearts going towards their goals 
        <br>
        They fall in love because of emotions 
        <br>
        And it is hard to understand their actions 
        <br>
        I thought love was sweet in my mouth 
        <br>
        But I found how bitter this sweetness is 
        <br>
        A lover? Or this is only my wide imagination 
        <br>
        That lives off of misery if her image disappears 
        <br>
        A friend? Is this why I fly in happiness 
        <br>
        In yearning and love when her name is mentioned?! 
        <br>
        My tortured heart is my sole problem 
        <br>
        And my soul will not be cured without her words 
        <br>
        Will I lose my life in the moment 
        <br>
        When her verdict is "NO"?! 
        <br>
        What should my heart do 
        <br>
        While my soul yearns to achieve its dream? 
        <br>
        O Lord! This is my story 
        <br>
        So give my soul patience from its pain 
        <br>
