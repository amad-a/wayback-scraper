              <br>
              There is a sleeping giant 
              <br>
              Who goes by many names: 
              <br>
              Avenger, Warrior, Punisher; 
              <br>
              His greatest name is Servant. 
              <br>
              His size is overwhelming, 
              <br>
              His strength beyond a legend. 
              <br>
              His purpose is to serve his 
              <br>
              Many names: Morality and Truth; 
              <br>
              Righteousness and Trust; 
              <br>
              Compassion, Brotherhod and Family Love; 
              <br>
              Honesty and Ethics; 
              <br>
              Justice and Respect; Honor, Goodness, 
              <br>
              And so many more; 
              <br>
              The giant has been tricked 
              <br>
              by corruption, lies, deceit, 
              <br>
              Into falling deep into 
              <br>
              A dreamless sleep. 
              <br>
              But beware, whosoever of you 
              <br>
              Bathe in evil, and prevail 
              <br>
              Upon others to do great wrongs, 
              <br>
              Beware! 
              <br>
              Run and hide behind your trees, 
              <br>
              For the giant, whose greatest name 
              <br>
              Is Servant, is awakening, 
              <br>
              And his roars of anger 
              <br>
              Will crumble mountains.
