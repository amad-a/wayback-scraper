              <br>
              Oh, Palestine 
              <br>
              that heart of yours 
              <br>
              made out of gold 
              <br>
              made out of jewels. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Oh, Palestine 
              <br>
              my Palestine 
              <br>
              the land of olives 
              <br>
              the land of vine. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Oh Palestine 
              <br>
              just tell me now 
              <br>
              what took so long 
              <br>
              for me to vow. 
              <br>
              <br>
              My love for you 
              <br>
              is ever so great 
              <br>
              this is my story 
              <br>
              I'll tell it straight. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Your city of peace 
              <br>
              the city of love 
              <br>
              with its olive branch 
              <br>
              carried by a dove. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Deep in my heart 
              <br>
              deep in my soul 
              <br>
              your cities of love 
              <br>
              I miss them all. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I come to you 
              <br>
              with an open arm 
              <br>
              I miss you true 
              <br>
              and miss your charm. 
              <br>
              <br>
              You gave me love 
              <br>
              and lots of hope 
              <br>
              with my loneliness 
              <br>
              I must cope. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I have no reason 
              <br>
              for being cruel 
              <br>
              since I had left you 
              <br>
              I felt like a fool. 
              <br>
              <br>
              But I promise you now 
              <br>
              in all God's might 
              <br>
              you won't be abandoned 
              <br>
              day or night. 
              <br>
              <br>
              You will be free 
              <br>
              and will be loved 
              <br>
              you won't be forgotten 
              <br>
              you won't be shoved. 
              <br>
              <br>
              This song is yours 
              <br>
              for being mine 
              <br>
              my love for you 
              <br>
              will always shine. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I will be there 
              <br>
              always be yours 
              <br>
              in your mountains 
              <br>
              on your shores. 
              <br>
              <br>
              From now on 
              <br>
              my dear Palestine 
              <br>
              I will be yours 
              <br>
              and you'll be mine. 
              <br>
              <br>
              No more good-byes 
              <br>
              no more so-long 
              <br>
              we will remain 
              <br>
              together 
              <br>
              FOR&nbsp; LONG.
