      he folktale was the major nightly entertainment in the early days before television and radio. The story teller was usually the grandfather, the grandmother, or one of the parents. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In every town there used to be what was called 
      <i>madhafah</i>
       (guest house) where visitors to the town would stay and be welcomed. The 
      <i>Hakawaaty</i>
       (story teller), who was the entertainer in the 
      <i>madhafah</i>,
      would tell the audience a story while playing a soft tune on his
      <i>rababah</i>
       (one-stringed violin-like instrument). The 
      <i>Hakawaaty</i>
       would tell stories such as 
      <i>Kulaib and Zeer, Abu Zeid, 'Antara, Arabian Nights</i>,
      and other short ones he might have heard in other towns.
      <br>
      <br>
      The family would enjoy their story time at night especially in the winter. The children would be sitting around the 
      <i>kanoon</i>
       (brazier) while the grandfather, the grandmother, or whoever is the story teller would be telling the story of that night.
