      Zarief E-ttool is the symbol name for the handsome, courageous Palestinianyoung man. Not necessary the beloved one, but also the strong fighter whodefend his country. In the Arabic language, Zarief E-ttool is a two syllabusexpression. It is composed of two words. Zarief, the first word, "comesfrom the infinitive "THURF", that means nice, handsome, or thegood looking

    </p>
    <p>Those two characters were presented in the Palestinian culture throughdances, songs, and tales. No matter in which shape they appeared, theirstory was the same.

      </p>
    </center>
    <p>Once upon a time, in the old days, there was a very rich trader whohad business and trades all over the Arabic world. He had a lot of peopleworking for him, among them was an intelligent young man. He was knownby Zarief E-ttool among the people of the city. He was very handsome, polite,dependable, but a poor person too. The trader used to depend a lot on Zarief.He used to leave the country and leave every thing for Zarief to take careof.</p>
    <p>One day, the trader's daughter came to the store looking for her father.She wanted to tell him that a very important visitor sent a message withhis servant, notifying them that he will come over for an urgent reason.When she came in, Zarief was serving a customer. She salute him, he lookedat her and did not believe what he saw: She was extremely beautiful. Withbig dark eyes, long, black, slightly-wavy hair, and her shy red cheeks,she meant beauty by all means. He answered her and promised to deliverthe message to her father. In her way out, he wanted to ask her about hername, but he could not dare asking about any personal information. Sincethat moment, Zarief's life was turned upside down. He could not sleep,he could not eat, her image was coming back to him every morning and night,till he started imagining seeing her every where. So, he decided to dowhatever it would take him in order to know more about her.</p>
    <p>One day, Zarief went to his boss's house as to bring some samples ofnew material. The trader welcomed him, called his daughter, and asked herto prepare some tea...And at that moment, Zarief was all ears to receivethe name of his beloved lady: Ataba. When she was back with the tea, herfather had excused himself to see someone at the door. So, Zarief tookthe chance, and complimented her name as she served him tea. She was veryshy that she could not lift her gaze. He apologized, and introduced himselfto her. And there, he was surprised that she knew his name from her father.She wanted to leave the room, but he stopped her, and asked her if he canmeet her at the river the next morning. She told him that this was notappropriate, and he would better not try cross his limits.</p>
    <p>That night was a long one for Zarief. He thought a lot about what heshould do so he can see Ataba. Finally, he decided to ask for her hand.So, the next morning, he went to the store, and waited for Ataba's father.When he came, Zarief asked him for Ataba's hand, and the father was shocked.He refused Zarief's demand, and told him that he can't supply Ataba withthe fine, high quality things that she was used to have. Zarief told himthat he can, and that he would do what ever he would ask him for in orderto prove that he wants Ataba. After arguing for a long time, the fatherdecided to give Ataba for Zarief if he would bring the best grapes in thecountry. So, Zarief accepted the condition, and started getting ready forthe trip. In his way, he met Ataba, and told her about his request andher father's condition. She was very shy when she told him that she knowsthat he can do it, and that she will wait for him. He was very happy, anddecided not to come back alive if he wont get the grapes. So, he went toKHALIL city, where the best grapes where grown. He bought some with allthe money he had, and started his way back. When he got to his city, heheaded to Ataba's house and gave the grapes to her father. The father wasdisappointed. He did not think that Zarief will survive till he gets toKHALIL city and comes back. So, he decided to send him to a farther city:YAFA to bring the best oranges.</p>
    <p>Zarief kept on going and coming back, every time he brings something,Ataba's father asks for something else. He traveled all around Palestine,used different ways of transportation, and met all kinds of people. Inhis way, he sang for Ataba in a sad theme, describing her and her smile,describing his love for her, and how he misses her. So, all the peoplearound Palestine knew him and his story with Ataba. They learned his songsand repeated his words as symbols of true love.</p>
    <p>His last trip was to Egypt. There, he had a friend who held the positionof the representative of the king (Mukhtar). So, Zarief went to see him,and told him about his story. The Mukhtar smiled, and told him not to worrybecause he will come back with him and talk to Ataba's father who was avery dear friend of his. Zarief was very happy in his way back, and couldn'twait to see Ataba. When they arrived to Palestine, they headed to Ataba'shouse. The father was happy when he saw his old friend, and asked him howhe decided to come all this way from Egypt to pay this visit. The Mukhtartold him about his request, and how he would guarantee Zarief as to bethe ideal man for Ataba. So, the father finally agreed and announced thepreparations for his daughter's marriage.</p>
    <p>
      Ataba's and Zarief's marriage was in a very big party. People from allover Palestine attended. "And Zarief's friends were singing a songfor Zarief congratulating him and telling his story in a very happy tone,accompanying the singing with the traditional dance: DABKEH

    <p>That was the story. Now if we analyze the characters, we will see howthe story carried the basics of the Arabic morals and traditions, and specifically,the Palestinian culture.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The trader</b>,
      for example, represented the typical sort of fatherwho would not give his only daughter to a poor man. Specially if she usedto live in a high class life style. He also showed the importance of oldfriendship when he accepted Zarief's request for his friends satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Mukhtar</b>
       is a wise man. That what his actions reflects. Heknew how to help Zarief, and in the same time without letting his old friendlooses his face and his self dignity between his other friends and customers.He shows how people should act in such sensitive situations, and how theyshould not omit social rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ataba</b>
       is the character of the Arabic shy girl, who would hideher love and keep her silence till the man makes the first move. She alsodid not accept meeting with him, although she loved him, because she wasa respectful girl who would not waste her and her family's status becauseof a stupid act.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Zarief E-ttool</b>,
      who was the main character of the story, wasnothing but a good human being. He presented the ideal Arabic, courageousyoung man who would do any thing for his girl. He also knew how to dealwith her father by setting a deal, knowing that a high status family won'tgive their daughter easily for a poor young man if he did not have themain other qualifications such as: intelligence, courage, force, morals...etc.He also knew whom to choose as a middle man, which is the way most of thepeople follow to get their requests in the Arab world.
    </p>
    <p>
      After looking at the main events of the story, and after analyzing thecharacters, we can see that the moral of the story is

    <p>The story was told in different ways for different purposes. The advantagesof telling the story for children are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>to learn the names of the big cities in Palestine.</li>
      <li>to know the agricultural resources in Palestine, and their locations.</li>
      <li>to know the ways of transportation used in Palestine at that time,and hence, the geography of Palestine.</li>
      <li>to know their traditions and culture.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The advantages of telling the story to young men and women are differsfrom the children's. Because by that time, they don't need to know aboutagriculture or ways of transportation, they want to know how the societysystem goes, and how they can reach their dreams. So, they will ...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>know that the pure love is a true, long- lasting love, and how to havea pure love.</li>
      <li>know the importance of traditions.</li>
      <li>know the importance of the good reputation about girls and how it concernsthe whole family.</li>

       : is known as "a special type of slowsad folk-songs. People sing it in weddings as an introduction before fastsongs" 
      <font size="-1">5</font>.
      It is mostly sang by men during theirlong nights, while they are sitting around the fire, relaxing and talking-outtheir problems. Ataba is a song that talks about the beloved girl's beautyand shyness, as well as how desperate the young men are because of themany unsuccessful ways they tried in order to win or even to get the attentionof the lovely "Ataba". So, the song takes the form of takingturns. Each one sing a verse of it when his turn comes. Usually, it takesthe whole night, not because it is a long song, but because young men getinvolved and passionate. So, they start making-up verses that tells eachone's love story.

       : is also known as a fast rhythmfolk-song. "it is sang at weddings and other happy occasions. It isthe type of fast, steady rhythm song, and it is accompanied with a specialfolk-dance called DABKEH." 
      <font size="-1">6</font>
       The song is sangin two ways: either the singers talk about the deeds of the courage ofZarief in wars and fights while defending his country and properties. Or,they talk about the looks of the handsome, charming young man. Mostly womensing this type, describing their feelings and yearning, each one of themfor her "Zarief E-ttool".
    </p>
    <p>In both types, Zarief E-ttool is usually away. He is living far fromhis country or his "Ataba". He does the impossible for his return,and beats all the dangers and difficulties that stands between him andbeautiful Ataba.</p>

        <font size="+1">Ataba &amp; Zarief E-ttool in the Arabic World:</font>

    </p>
    <p>
      In other countries than Palestine, Ataba is known in the same type ofsong, but with different words. In 
      <i>Lebanon</i>,
      for an example, peoplesing some "Ataba" before any other folk-song in different occasions.It has the same impression on them as in Palestine, because of it's sadtheme, and the sensitive love feelings expressed by the singers. Lateron, people in Lebanon and other countries such as:
      <i>Jordan</i>,
      <i>Syria</i>,
      and
      <i>Iraq</i>
       started singing "Ataba" as a theme. They changedthe words only from love songs to yearning words for their countries, relatives,friends, and even asking God to help them in their life.
    </p>
    <p>Zarief E-ttool, like Ataba, kept it's theme and dance too. Whereverpeople sang Zarief E-ttool, they accompanied it with a DABKEH. In Lebanon,Syria, and Jordan, the topic of the song is always the same. Where thewords are concerned, only slight changes occurred due to the differentaccents.</p>

        <font size="+1">In Conclusion:</font>
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>At the present time, "Ataba" and "Zarief E-ttool"are considered as important parts in the Palestinian heritage. They carrythe bases of the Palestinian folklore: songs, dances, and tales. That iswhy we; Palestinians; teach this tale at our Arabic schools in Montreal.So the children would have the chance to get the objectives and the advantagesof the events of the story , just like their brothers and sisters backhome in Palestine.</p>
