              Computerized 3D graphics has played a big part in bridging the gap between reality and the imagination. With today's 3D tools becoming more enhanced and affordable, it would be safe to say that computerized 3D graphics and animation is here to stay, and will be available to a wider range of users with time.

              With the use of computerised 3D, graphic artists and non-professionals alike can produce imagery and animations that can be applied to a wide variety of industries and professions. With use of such software, users are no longer bound by convention, but only by the limitations of their own imagination.

The features of this package are outstanding and available at a cost of well under $NZD1000, which 2 years ago would of cost a buyer well in excess of $NZD$5000.</font>
