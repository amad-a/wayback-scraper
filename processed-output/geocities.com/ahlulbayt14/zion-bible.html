              <p align="justify">I wish to make it plain at the outset that my remarks are directed to oneaspect of Zionist claims-the claim to fulfil scripture by the establishment of aJewish state in Palestine-and must not be interpreted in any other way or betaken to prejudice the claim of the Jews to be allowed to make a home in Palestine.</p>
              <p align="justify">To a superficial reader it well might seem that a divinepromise to give a land to a particular people made some four thousand years agoand often repeated constituted that people owners of that land by divine right.Now if this is the Jewish title to Palestine it must be carefully scrutinized.Accordingly I propose to examine a few texts which are familiar to allpracticing Jews, and which have profoundly influenced some Christian bodies, particularly in America.</p>
              <p>
                The points which are of importance are: 
                <br>
                (1) To whom were the promises made? 
                <br>
                (2) What was the extent of the land which was promised? And 
                <br>
                (3) Was the promise irrevocable or was it subject to any conditions?
              </p>
              <p align="justify">

                    <font color="#0000FF">(1) TO WHOM WERE THE PROMISES MADE?</font>
                  </u>
                </b>
              </p>
              <p align="justify">The first explicit promise of Palestine to the descendantsof Abraham was at Shechem (now Nablus) in Genesis xii, 7: 'Unto thy seed will Igive this land.' Ch. xiii, 15, when Abraham is standing on a hill near Bethel,has the words: 'all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thyseed forever'. xv, 18 is more explicit: 'Unto thy seed have I given this land,from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates'. The promisesare repeated to Isaac; and to Jacob in xxviii, 12: 'the land where-on thouliest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed, and thy seed shall be as thedust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east,and to the north, and to the south; and in thee and in thy seed shall all thefamilies of the earth be blessed'. When Abraham made a covenant with God throughcircumcision (xvii, 8) all the land of Canaan was promised to him as 'aneverlasting posses貞ion.' Other passages might be quoted, but these are repre貞entative,and others add nothing that is relevant here.</p>
              <p align="justify">
                Now it is generally supposed that these promises were madeto the Jews, and to the Jews alone. But that is not what the Bible says. Theword 'to thy seed' inevitably include Arabs, both Muslims and Christians, whocan claim descent from Abraham through his son Ishmael. (Here we are notconcerned with the Muslim tradition that Abraham was once at Meccah and leftIshmael there). Ishmael was the reputed father of a large number of Arab tribes 
                <sub>3</sub>
                 and Genesis records that Abraham became the father of many north Arabiantribes through his concubine Keturah. It cannot be argued that the words ofGenesis xxi, 10-12, necessarily cancel the promises made to Abraham's seed as awhole: '(Sarah) said to Abraham, Cast out this bond-woman and her son: for theson of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son Isaac. And the thing wasvery grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son. And God said untoAbraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because ofthy bondwoman: in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice: for inIsaac shall seed be called unto thee. And also of the son of the bondwoman willI make a nation, because he is thy seed'. It is true that henceforth among thedescendants of Isaac 'the seed of Abraham' was taken to mean the Israelites; butfrom the beginning it was not so, and the descendants of Ishmael had every rightto call and consider themselves of the seed of Abraham. .
              </p>
              <p align="justify">Moreover, when the covenant of circumcision was made withAbraham (Genesis xvii) and the land of Canaan was promised as 'an everlastingpossession', it was Ishmael who was circumcised: Isaac had not then been born.</p>
              <p align="justify">From this brief study of the divine promise to the descen苓antsof Abraham we see that the first promise necessarily included all thedescendants of Ishmael; but that afterwards in the time of Isaac and Jacob thepromise was narrowed to their descendants, though not in such a way as toexclude explicitly their Arab brethren; and it is well known that many Arabsaccompanied Moses and Joshua into Palestine when the country was partiallyoccupied; and not a little of Moses' success was due to the kindness andhospitality of Jethro the Midianite, who was of course an Arab and Moses'father-in-law.</p>
              <p align="justify">

              </p>
              <p align="justify">
                The second question as to what was the extent of 'ThePromised Land' is a little difficult to determine (3). The passages quoted under(1) begin with a vague reference to 'this land' from the starting point ofShechem (Nablus), and go on to include all the area from 'the river of Egypt' tothe Euphrates; the third passage speaks of Abraham's descendants spreading outin all four directions. Here, again, it is important to note that the promise ofdominion from Nile to Euphrates was made before the birth of Ishmael and beforethe birth of Isaac, so that this territory was not to be necessarily andexclusively Israelite; 
                <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">and save for theshort period when Solomon's authority was recognized in this area (I Kings iv,21) it has always been in the possession of the Arabs.</i>
              </p>
              <p align="justify">Looking again at Genesis xiii, 15, it is clear that Trans虻ordaniawas included in the promise to Abraham, because it would be plainly visible fromthe hill at Bethel; but this promise again predates the birth of Ishmael andIsaac, and so cannot be held to constitute an exclusively Israelite claim to theterritory on the other side of the Jordan.</p>
              <p align="justify">
                However, in the Book of Deuteronomy Moses told the peoplethat God had commanded them to go in and occupy the country from theMediterranean in the west to the Euphrates in the east, and from the Negeb inthe south to the Lebanon in the north. These instructions the Israelites didnot, or could 
                <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">not,</b>
                 carry out. Theycould not occupy the coast land which the Philistines held, and they neverpossessed the ports or the hinter衍and of Phoenicia. Some centuries later inthe reign of David, they did gain possession of Damascus, and David entered intoa treaty of friendship with Hiram, king of Tyre; so that when Solomon held agreat service of dedication when the temple building was completed deputies camefrom as far north as the region of llama and from the south as far as the modernEl-'Arish. But before Solomon's reign had ended much of David's empire hadreturned to its former possessors. Everyone is aware that the process ofattrition went on until the kingdom of Judea was confined to a few hundredsquare miles of land round Jerusalem, and even this was lost to the Babyloniansin 597 B.C.

                  <font color="#0000FF">
                    <u>(3) WAS THE PROMISE IRREVOCABLE?</u>

                <o:p></o:p>
              </p>
              <p align="justify">
                It will have been observed that two of the passages quotedunder (1) use the words 'for ever' and 'everlasting' of what is to be a futureIsraelite occupation of Palestine. The same word stands for both the Englishrenderings in the Hebrew original; and 'everlasting' is not the proper meaning.The word 
                <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">('olam)</i>
                 means a long time','antiquity', 'futurity', and we read of 'days of old', 'waste places of old','gates of old', 'from of old', and similar expressions, all of which employ thisword rendered above 'for ever', or 'everlasting'. Again, a psalmist says: 'Iwill sing for ever', an expression which the most literal interpreter of HolyScripture can hardly suppose to be the literal meaning!
              </p>
              <p align="justify">Thus, summing up the evidence so far adduced, one is forcedto the conclusion that the land of Palestine was not originally promised to theJews exclusively, and that the first promise was indefinite ('this land') andwas subsequently enlarged to include Transjordan, Syria, the Lebanon, and thenomad's land as far as the Euphrates. Lastly we see that there never was anunconditional promise of an everlasting possession; though a long and indefiniteperiod was intended.</p>
              <p align="justify">We are now led to a stage of history and prophecy whichbear more directly on current misunderstandings of Hebrew prediction. Had we noprophetic messages to guide us it would be apparent that these promises ofpossession of the land of Canaan were not unconditional: the covenant relationbetween Israel and God demanded loyalty from the people, and indivi苓ual andcorporate righteousness. Were the people to fail in these respects a terribledoom awaited them. The following words spoken by Moses in the 28th ch. ofDeuteronomy apply in parts so easily to the sufferings of Jewry in the past fewyears that many have seen in them a prophecy of our own times:</p>
              <p align="justify">"It shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken untothe voice of the Lord thy God to observe to do all his commandments and hisstatutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come uponthee and shall overtake thee... And the Lord shall scatter you among thepeoples, from the one end of the earth; and there thou shalt serve other gods,which thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers, even wood and stone. And amongthese nations shalt thou find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the soleof thy foot; but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart and failing ofeyes, and pining of soul; and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee...</p>
              <p align="justify">Here it is clear that the divine promises to the patriarchshave been annulled by the national apostasy; and when the Assyrian captivityremoved the population of Samaria, and the Babylonian captivity the people ofJudah, the prophets saw in the disasters a vindication of the divine justice ona disobedient and gainsaying people.</p>
              <p align="justify">But they taught their people that a remnant would return,and would restore the temple and the religious life of the com衫unity; and theylooked forward to a time when the earth would be filled with the knowledge ofthe Lord. It is often forgotten that these men were inspired poets who mingledvery practical matters like the Return from the Babylonian Exile with sublimepictures of the desert blossoming as the rose, the lion lying down with thelamb, men beating their swords into pruning hooks, and forsaking and forswearingwar for ever. They also prophesied of the setting up of the kingdom of David.</p>
              <p align="justify">Unhappily, the practical was fulfilled and the ideal re衫ainedan ideal. Owing to the fact that the things that religious men yearn for werenot realized when the Jews returned to Palestine there has been a tendency inthe past to interpret not only the eschatological passages in the prophets butalso the practical and political prophecies, of some time in the future; and asall prophecies in the Old Testament necessarily and inevitably center round theJewish people and their relation to God, the Golden Age is inseparable from theHoly City inhabited by holy Israelites. It would seem to be the hope of somethat if the Jews could be returned to Palestine and form a state the Golden Agewould, in some mysterious way, appear on earth.</p>
              <p align="justify">But such views are a distortion of the Old Testamentprophecies which predicted a return from Babylon and from all the lands whitherthe Jews had been exiled. And these pro計hecies were fulfilled. The Jews didreturn to Judea, they did rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, and they did rebuildthe temple; and after fluctuating fortunes they did secure a brief period ofpolitical independence and expansion under the Maccabbees. Thus the propheciesof the Return have been fulfilled, and they cannot be fulfilled again. Withinthe canonical literature of the Old Testament there is no prophecy of a secondreturn after the return from the Babylonian Exile; because (a) after the Exileall the Jews who wished to do so had returned to the Holy Land, though a greatmany more preferred to remain where they were and formed the Diaspora whichafterwards became the backbone of the Christian Church; and (b) the last of theprophets died centuries before the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.</p>
              <p align="justify">It would be possible to criticize the claim that Scriptureprophesies Jewish supremacy in Palestine from the point of view of the HigherCriticism of the Old Testament; but this has been intentionally ignored; and theBible has been left to speak for itself.</p>
              <p align="justify">Again, it would be possible to use the New Testamentargument that the Church is now the Israel of God; but this seems inadvisable.This short study is in no sense a polemic; but a brief examination of what theOld Testament says on matters in which its authority has been evoked.</p>
