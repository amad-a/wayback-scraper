            If Prophet Muhammad (s) visited you 
            <br>
            Just for a day or two, 
            <br>
            If he came unexpectedly,I wonder what you'd do,
          </font>
        </p>
        <p>
          <font face="verdana," helvetica="" size="3" color="cc44aa">
            Oh, I know you'd give your nicest room 
            <br>
            To such an honored 
            <br>
            And all the food you'd serve him, 
            <br>
            Would be the very best,
          </font>
        </p>
        <p>
          <font face="verdana," helvetica="" size="3" color="cc44aa">
            And you would keep assuring him, 
            <br>
            You're glad to have him there, 
            <br>
            That serving him in your home, 
            <br>
            Is joy beyond compare.

        </p>
        <p>
          <font face="verdana," helvetica="" size="3" color="cc44aa">
            But ... when you saw him coming, 
            <br>
            Would you meet him at the door, 
            <br>
            With arms outstretched in welcome 
            <br>
            To your visitor?
          </font>
        </p>
        <p>
          <font face="verdana," helvetica="" size="3" color="cc44aa">
            Or ... would you have to change your clothes 
            <br>
            Before you let him in? 
            <br>
            Or hide some magazines and put 
            <br>
            The Qur'an where they had been?
          </font>
        </p>
        <p>
          <font face="verdana," helvetica="" size="3" color="cc44aa">
            Would you still watch the same movies 
            <br>
            On your T.V. set? 
            <br>
            Or would you switch it off 
            <br>
            Before he gets upset?
          </font>
        </p>
        <p>
          <font face="verdana," helvetica="" size="3" color="cc44aa">
            Would you turn off the radio, 
            <br>
            And hope he hadn't heard? 
            <br>
            And wish you hadn't uttered that last hasty word? 
            <br>
            Would you hide your worldly music,
          </font>
        </p>
        <p>
          <font face="verdana," helvetica="" size="3" color="cc44aa">
            And instead take Hadith books out? 
            <br>
            Could you let him walk right in, 
            <br>
            Or would you have to rush about?
          </font>
        </p>
        <p>
          <font face="verdana," helvetica="" size="3" color="cc44aa">
            And, I wonder ... if the Prophet spent 
            <br>
            A day or two with you, 
            <br>
            Would you go right on doing the things 
            <br>
            You always do?
          </font>
        </p>
        <p>
          <font face="verdana," helvetica="" size="3" color="cc44aa">
            Would you go right on saying the things 
            <br>
            You always say? 
            <br>
            Would life for you continue, 
            <br>
            As it does from day to day?
          </font>
        </p>
        <p>
          <font face="verdana," helvetica="" size="3" color="cc44aa">
            Would your family squabbles 
            <br>
            Keep up their usual pace, 
            <br>
            And Would you find it hard each meal 
            <br>
            To say a table grace?
          </font>
        </p>
        <p>
          <font face="verdana," helvetica="" size="3" color="cc44aa">
            Would you keep up each and every prayer 
            <br>
            Without putting on a frown? 
            <br>
            And would you always jump up early 
            <br>
            For prayer at dawn?
          </font>

        <p>
          <font face="verdana," helvetica="" size="3" color="cc44aa">
            Would you sing the songs you always sing, 
            <br>
            And read the books you read? 
            <br>
            And let him know the things on which 
            <br>
            Your mind and spirit feed?

            Would you take the Prophet with you 
            <br>
            Everywhere you plan to go? 
            <br>
            Or, would you maybe change your plans 
            <br>
            Just for a day or so?

            Would you be glad to have him meet 
            <br>
            Your very closest friends? 
            <br>
            Or, would you hope they stay away 
            <br>
            Until his visit ends?

            Forever, on and on?

            Or would you sigh with great relief 
            <br>
            When he at last was gone?
