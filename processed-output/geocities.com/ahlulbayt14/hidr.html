      <pre>Be it Badr, Uhud or Khaibar,We hear the cry, Haidar - Haidar.We see his shining sword strikethe ones who Allah dislikes.All those who even dareto fight him and aren't awareof his valor - can't survive.They shall loose their lives.And there is one who claims to bethe greatest warrior of Arabia - but seethe mighty sword falls on him too.Even though to challenge him were few.The Muslims are struck with terror.They can't conquer the fort of Khaibar.Each attack they make is turned back.The will to fight they utterly lack.The one who Allah loves, then comesand out of fear the enemy is numb.He takes the standard in one handand leads this seemingly defeated band.A group of losers, say the books of historyunder his command proceed to their victory.His advances no one can ever cut short.Finally he conquers the impenetrable fort.In another battle the Prophet is betrayed.As his followers have become so afraid.They leave him wounded and run away.Kufr still seems to hold it's sway.But there is Haidar e Karrar to aid him.A lost battle, he will be able to win.Whenever Asadullah will be there,to fight Islam, no one shall dare.These astonishing feats no one can hide,as time and again he turns the tide.A battle comes and a battle goes byIslam's standard always remains high.So when in Ghadir - he is proclaimedMawla - that Muslims should follow him.The Prophet's mission is complete. He alonecan bear the burden of this throne.Only he can feel the Muslim's needs,make sure they perform good deeds,and guide them to the path of salvation.He deserves the rulership of this nation.He has the understanding and wisdomto be the Imam in Allah's kingdom.He is the gateway to the city of knowledgeand above all he has the most courage,which is seen by his extraordinary feats.With his scholarly skills none can compete.Admire his piety. He is not guided by greed.The Prophet of Allah - only he can succeed.</pre>
