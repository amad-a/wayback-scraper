      O you who seek 
      <b>truth</b>,
      come, have pity on yourself. Find a cure for thesickness of ignorance by which you take your imagination to be reality andfrom which you suffer all your life. While you can, search for a cure dayand night, until you feel secure from all that you fear.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">You do see some people at peace, saved from the disease of ambition, thoughthey have less than you do while you are in pain and oppressed by all thatyou have.</p>
    <p align="justify">
      A day will certainly come when you will regret all this, but it may be toolate. Seek wisdom now, start to learn and leave this ignorance which youtake for knowledge. Seek the company of those who have come to know the 
      <b>truth</b>
       and learn their language so that you understand what they say.Salvation is in a perfect man.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      After you find the perfect teacher for you, let your love for him be yourguide. It is from him that you will learn to find yourself and find the 
      <b>truth</b>
       in your own being.

    <p align="justify">Imam Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, asked the Messenger ofAllah (s): "What action can I take that is not totally lost and worthless?"</p>

      <font color="navy">Seek the company of the wise, who know.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
      <font color="navy">Agree with what they say, for one understands only that with which one agrees.</font>

    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      O seeker of 
      <b>truth</b>,
      the path to
      <b>truth</b>
       is very short. It is closer to youthan your jugular vein, yet there are seventy thousand barriers, allcreated by you.
    </p>
    <p>The one who already knows, understands. What have I told you the one who isheedless?</p>
    <p>He is not here.</p>
    <p>And what does animal hear but noise?</p>
    <p>It either runs away or comes here.</p>
    <p>If you did not understand you are not here.</p>
    <p align="justify">Let me tell you so that you can judge yourself. If you know, you would bewith Man, not with animals shaped like men.</p>
    <p align="justify">One day the inhabitants will leave this place. Your every cell will returnto dust, and you will be left by yourself. Woe to the one who does not knowhimself! Then you will walk alone.</p>
    <p align="justify">
      O you who wish to understand wake up from heedlessness, look at reality,admit that now you are drunk and that all you know is your imagination. Ifyou hinestly seek 
      <b>truth</b>,
      if you really wish to wake up, you must firstattain the
      <b>truth</b>
       of dying before dying. You must die before dying in orderto be alive. You must leave the imagination of this world so that you canarrive.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      To learn constancy and love you have to suffer the beloved's hiding fromyou, and only if you are patient in suffering will you find faith. But ifyou claim you are faithful already, and exhibit yourself worshiping the oneto whom you claim to be faithful, hoping to receive His reward...suddenlyone day you may find yourself face to face with the 
      <b>truth</b>
       that should havebeen worshiped. Only it will be too late. You will be dead. You will regretit, but to no avail.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">I have gone there and came back and am giving you the news. Only when yoursoul is in human shape can you gain or lose. Take lessons from all you see,but never say, "Why is it not another way?"</p>
    <p align="justify">They are but bits and pieces and they seem disconneceted. Try to gatherthem together; your reason is the means. Be in the now, but contemplateyour end.</p>
    <p align="justify">I know that this realm has an owner and the Sultan lives in the palace ofyour being. Know yourself so that you will not be ashamed when you meetHim. Don't look down on anything, don't try to take someone else's share,know right from wrong, just from unjust for the human being is built fromthe brick of lawful sustenance and the mortar of the advice of the wise.The human being is destroyed by that which is unlawful, by the chatter ofthe ignorant.</p>
    <p align="justify">
      Be concious, take advice from what you see. Listen to your conscience andtalk with with reason. Behave correctly even when you are by yourself. Knowyour place and be humble. Kneel and sit low in the presence of the wise. Donot speak before being asked. If asked, be brief and say which you know. Donot be selfish. Know that 
      <b>truth</b>
       is with you always and everywhere. Be loyalto your friends and trustworthy to all.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">Speak gently to the ignorant. Be polite and quiet in the presence of thewise. If you ask of a teacher, ask with respect. Never ask a question withan intent to test, and accept the answer and agree with it, even if it isnot what you expected. If you reject, you will be rejecting yourself.</p>
    <p align="justify">In this palace of your being there are many chambers with His secrettreasures, but the palace is His. There is none other than He. If youaccept yourself as His servant, behave as a servant, but if you have becomethe perfect man then you are sultan; all is yours and you have to keep itsafe and secure.</p>
    <p align="justify">If you do not know yourself, you are neither sultan nor slave. Be prepared,then to be put to shame and never to see the sultan of the domain. Then youare only the dust thrown hither and thither with each breath. Hold on tothe one who knows so that you know also. Otherwise, you will bedisconcerted and confused.</p>
    <p align="justify">
      The purpose of coming to this world is to know yourself and know the 
      <b>truth</b>.
      At this stage of your eternal life you must learn on differentiate
      <b>truth</b>
       from falsehood. Do not spend your one and only lifetime in vain.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">If you call yourself a human being then climb to the summit of your being,where you will find reason, and seek. Look at the flat lands, the climbs,and the falls for there are many fearful chasms so that you will be securefrom fear.</p>
    <p align="justify">
      Those who are unable to discern 
      <b>truth</b>
       from falsehood walk through this lifeblindly. They still run in circles today.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">Each man is responsible for his own soul. For many, what they think theyknow is a veil preventing them from finding the secret. they ask eachother, What is this place? Who built it? bewildered, the blind leading theblind.</p>
    <p align="justify">The one who feels he is high peers down and looks for below. The one who oslow keeps up and seeks it above.</p>
    <p align="justify">From the time He gathered the souls and asked them: "Am I not your Lord?"until the coming of the perfect human being, one hundred and twenty fourthousand blessed messengers came and passed.</p>
    <p>Each said one thing and many took heed.</p>
    <p align="justify">Then the last blessed one came and saw the builder within what He built,showed Him to us manifest in what He created. The one who sees, sees. Whatis it to the blind? If you are bind, find a guid who sees. But how do theblind know if someone else sees?</p>
    <p align="justify">
      The 
      <b>truth</b>
       you seek has neither before nor after, is not in the past nor inthe future. It is in the now. It has no above nor below. It is where youstand. It has neither right nor left. It is the center. It is an ocean thatfits into every existance, for everything that exists is from oneexistance.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">The ones who see anything ugly in it are rejected, because the light comesfrom the flame as in a crystal chandelier, where each crystal reflects thelight of the same candle. All creation is but one being. Alas, they speakdifferent tongues.</p>
    <p align="justify">
      It was not my intention to give you any advice, for often the 
      <b>truth</b>
       is toldand all who hear depart. Only the ones who are destined to hear, hear.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      I do not speak of myself. It is the 
      <b>truth</b>
       that speaks, out of compassion.The 
      <b>truth</b>
       wills none to burn. Someone destitute with pockets full of gems,someone who refuses to put his hands in his pockets, cannot call tyrant theone who gave him the treasures, and the hands to hold them. He is theJustest of the just who said:
    </p>
    <p>The one who does an atom's worth of good, will receive good.</p>
    <p>The one who does an atom's worth of harm, will meet with harm.</p>
