      Thirty years have passed since Messianic Jews tried to and partially succeeded in burning-down Islam's third holiest sanctuary, Al-Masjid al-Aqsa. The nefarious sacrilege was by no means, as the Israeli government then suggested, an isolated act committed by a deranged man who acted on his own. Quite the contrary, the morbid Israeli designs against the sacred Muslim shrine show that diabolical feat was a deliberate collective act of aggression carried out with the unmistakable acquiescence of the Israeli political establishment and the active encouragement of much of the world's Jewry and their fundamentalist Christian allies. The following is a list of the acts of aggression and desecration against the Al-Aqsa Mosque since June 7, 1967: 
      <br>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">June 7, 1967: The occupation authorities confiscated the keys of the western gate known as Bab-el-Maghrabia immediately after Israeli troops seized the town from the fleeing Jordanians.</p>
    <p align="justify">June 9, 1967: The congregational Friday Prayer was not held on orders from the occupation authorities. That was the first time the Juma'a prayer didn't take place since the liberation of Jerusalem from the hands of the crusades in 1187 A.D.</p>
    <p align="justify">June 21, 1969: An Australian-born Zionist terrorist, Denis Michael Rohan, entered the mosque and set the magnificent Nurrudin Zinki Mihrab on fire. The fire gutted the unique Mihrab, which has been restored. The sacrilegious act against the mosque was condemned worldwide, but was praised by the wide segments of world Jewry and Christian fundamentalists who view the creation of Israel in Palestine as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy and a precedence to the second advent of Jesus.</p>
    <p align="justify">November 16, 1969: The Israeli occupation authorities seized the Fakhriyya corner on the south-western side of the Haram-al-Sharif.</p>
    <p align="justify">August 14, 1970: The Gershon Salmon group, an ultra-fanatic group dedicated to the so-called rebuilding of the temple of Solomon on the site of Al-Masjidul Aqsa after it is demolished, forcibly entered the premises of the Haram, but were repulsed by Muslims. The confrontation resulted in tens of worshippers being injured by Israeli troop gunfire.</p>
    <p align="justify">April 19, 1980: A group of Jewish rabbis and sages held a semi-secret conference devoted to exploring ways and means "to liberate the Temple Mount from Muslim hands."</p>
    <p align="justify">August 28, 1980: The Israeli occupation authorities dug a tunnel right underneath he mosque.</p>
    <p align="justify">March 30, 1982: Numerous letters were sent to Muslim Waqf authorities urging them to abandon the temple mount and warning them of the dire consequences of their "usurpation of our temple". The letters were written in Hebrew, English, French, Spanish and Polish. May 20, 1982: Several Zionist organizations sent death threats to Waqf officials.</p>
    <p align="justify">April 11, 1982: An Israeli soldier named Allen Goodman stormed the interior of the mosque spraying worshippers with bullets from his M-16 assault rifle, killing and wounding over 60 Palestinians.</p>
    <p align="justify">March 26, 1983: The main entrance to the Jerusalem's Waqf department collapsed due to Israeli excavation underneath.</p>
    <p align="justify">August 21, 1985: The Israeli police permitted Jewish extremists to hold prayers within the confines of the Haram promises.</p>
    <p align="justify">August 4, 1986: A group of Rabbis issued a final ruling allowing Jews to pray at the Haram-al-Sharif, and demanded the establishment of a synagogue in the area.</p>
    <p align="justify">May 12, 1988: Israeli soldiers opened fire on a peaceful Muslim march at the Haram, killing, and wounding about a hundred Palestinians.</p>
    <p align="justify">August 8, 1990: The Israeli authorities committed a grisly massacre at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, killing 22 worshippers and injuring over 200.</p>
    <p align="justify">July 25, 1995, the Israeli high court of justice issued a ruling, allowing Jews to pray at the "Temple Mount". The decision sparked off widespread protests among Muslims.</p>
