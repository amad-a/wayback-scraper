          MASS OF THE DRUNKIn circles mystic I found notThe pleasantness I soughtIn monastery was not audibleThe music which love wroughtIn school I did not find to readAny book to be from the friendIn minaret it was hard to findThe voice to be of him to tendIn love of books I could not seeThat veiled beauty's faceIn sacred writs I could not getThe destination's traceIn idol-house my life's spanWas wholly spent in vainIn rivals' gathering I sawNeither remedy nor painThe lover's ring now must I joinHaply to find for solaceFrom the rose- garden of the belovedA pleasing breeze or a trace"We" and "I" are both from reasonThat are used as ropes to bindIn mass of those who are drunkNeither "I" is nor "We" to find

          LOVER'S RAPTUREOh That heart is no heart at allWhich loves thy fair face notOh that wise is no wise at allWho craves not thy beauty spotOh for the heart - raptured loverPapture's all that's in thy wineFor me save this rapture aloneWhat else has this life's confineWho hath thrown me in this desertIt was love of thine, o my friendWhat act now can rescue meNowhere seen is the desert's endIf thou art a heart - raptured loverPut soon then thyself aside'Twixt you and him there's noneBut wall of your self- prideIf you are an traveller of lover's pathShun prayer- carpet, cloak thenNo guide's there but love aloneIn love thyself soak thenIf thou art real lover thenBe not mystic - pious proneAs none can enter lovers' ringBut the lovers' group aloneI wish to play with his ringleted hairWhat's bad in that what's vileOne mad touch and one wild strokeWhat else can give love imbecileGet hold of my arm and set freeMy soul from this robe cantAs this robe is nothing elseBut the refuge of ignorantKnowledge, mysticism leave them asideThey lead not to the wine - houseAs in the place where lovers resideFalsehood cannot find spouse

          DRUNKARDS' FOLDO for the dayThat I be the dust of his wayThat I give up life for himThat his true lover I stayO for the dayThat a cup soul- stirringI get from his kind handAnd, forgetting both worldsBe chained to his hair's strandO for the dayThat my head be at his feetKissing till life's time is upAnd I be, till doomsdayDrunken from his cupO for the dayThat I burn like a loverAlways for him and gazeAt his sweet faceIn drunkard's dazeO for the dayThat I be fully drunkIn drunkard's foldAnd come to know allIts secrets untoldO for the dayThat I have at bed's endMy Joseph's merrimentAnd if not, like JacobBe enamoured of his scent

          LOVE'S GLANCEO my love, my world beginsAnd ends at your doorIf my life be spent hereI need nothing moreIn tavern, mosque, monasteryAnd idol- temple floorI bow down in the hope thatYou would bless me and adoreNot a cure could find seminaryFor my troubles nor the saintO get me out of messWith your glance ere I faintO full of ego was the mysticAs far as I could gleanO let me have your visionSo my heart remains cleanI have shunned myself's loveSo do I now existO have your gracious look at meThis insignificat gistThey call me man of pleasureAnd they name me just a loverO my joy- shorn heart be sureHas never worn this coverLife of hermit have I chosenFor that veiled darlingSo that with his amorous glanceThis drop be sea snarling

          SICKLY EYESWhat charming mole thy lips haveBehold! that I am caughtPray, what thy sickly eyes haveThat sickened is my heartI have shunn'd my self's loveNow truth is none but meI will see the gallows alsoAs did Mansur seeO darling, it's thy thought's flameThat sets my heart afireIf I am now the talk of townMy name thou didst inspireKeep the door of tavern openFor me night and dayFarewell seminary, farewell mosqueLet me go my wayIt was quite ere long you knowThat pietistic garment I toreThe tavern- keeper's patched dressTo find the way I woreLo! city's priest tortures meWith sermons vile and rotWhere art thou! do rescue meHearken, the spirit of sotO what a place is idol-houseGood memories let me cherishThe tavern- keeper's magic touchHast made my sleep perish

          SEA OF ANNIHILATIONHow I long for the dayThat thy lane be my homeFor this joy, for this sorrowMy heart's desires roamI wish I had in my handFrom thy locks just a knotThat would serve as a keyTo my evey troubled spotLast night without youWas obscure heart of mineIn that house thy thoughtWas the only piercing shineAll the friends in that gatheringWere drunk, senselessAnd the wise like meWas ill- fated in the messHe who broke open prisonsWas oppressor, illiterateAbout the self, universeAll clean was his slateFor the lovers all knowledgeIs nothing but a veilHe who went beyond the veilUpon the truth could prevailLo the lovers out of loveIn the sea of annihilation swamAnd those on the shores darkLooked ignorant and shamI did find the spiritual worldAs I fell in love with the sweetAll I read and heard beforeWas false, counterfeit

          GARMENT TEARINGHow crave I from my love's handTo drink a cup of wineO with whom to share this secretWhere to take this grief of mineI gave away my life in hopeThat I could see the friend's face'Am butterfly making rounds of lamp'Am seed burning in fireplaceThis robe dseceptive and so cantThis prayer- mat with false stateWould that I could tear them offRight in front of tavern's gateIf friend out of love's cupBe willing to give a small sipThis soul in my life's cloakSo happily would I give in tip'Am old though yet can be youngDo favour with thy sweet glanceSo that from this small houseOf universe I make advance

          SWEET ENDWith wine o my loveFill up this cup of mineLet not my honour growLet not my name shineThat kind pour in cupWhich overpowers meWhich purifies the soulOf artifice to teeThat fine blissful wineWhich sets the soul freeWhich makes splendour runWhich makes glory fleeThat unrespected wineWhich all the graceless drinkIn which submissions drownIn which humilities sinkIn rose - cheeks' sacred sancturyIn tavern come and seeFrom every slit I enterThe fairies welcome meNow haply should I goTo the ring of drunken peersWith wine cleanse who mindsOf thoughts in low gearsO thou rarified airGive mine wish and greetingWhen passing other world's riverTo that valley's sweetingIn goblet one I crossedThis life's road bendLet know the monastery headHow sweet was my end
