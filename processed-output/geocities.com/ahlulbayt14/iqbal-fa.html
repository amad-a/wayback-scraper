      <pre>Mary is hallowed in one line alone,That she bore Jesus; Fatima in three, (*)For that she was the sweet delight of himWho came a mercy to all living things,Leader of former as of latter saints,Who breathed new spirit into this dead worldAnd brought to birth the age of a New Law.His lady she, whose regal diademGod's words adorn Hath there come any time,The chosen one, resolver of all knotsAnd hard perplexities, the Lion of God,An emperor whose place was a hut,Accoutered with one sword, one coat of mail.And she his mother, upon whom revolvesLove's compasses, the leader of Love's train,That single candle in the corridorOf sanctity resplendent, guardianOf the integrity of that best raceOf all God's peoples; who, that the fierce flameOf war and hatred might extinguished beTrod underfoot the crown and royal ringHis mother too, the lord of all earth's saintsAnd strong right arm of every freeborn man,Husain, the passion in the song of life,Teacher of freedom to God's chosen few.The character, the essential purityOf holy children from the mothers come.She was the harvest of the well-sown fieldOf self-surrender, to all mothers sheThe perfect pattern, Fatima the chaste.Her heart so grieved, because one came in need,She stripped her cloak and sold it to a Jew;Though creatures all, of light alike and fire,Obeyed her bidding, yet she sank her willIn her good consort's pleasure. FortitudeAnd meekness were her schooling; while her lipsChanted the Book, she ground the homely mill.No pillow needed she to catch her tears,But wept contrition's offering of pearlsUpon the skirt of prayer; which Gabriel stoopedTo gather, as they glistened i the dust,And rained like dew upon the Throne of God.God's Law a fetter of locks about my feetTo guard secure the Prophet's high behest,Else had I surely gone about her tombAnd fallen prostrate, worshipping her dust.</pre>
