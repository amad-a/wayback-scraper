        <b>al-Quds: The Focus of Muslims Grief</b>
      </font>

    <p></p>
    <hr size="1">
    <p align="justify">"To liberate Quds (Jerusalem), Muslims must depend on the power of Islam."</p>
    <p align="justify">"The day of Quds is a day when all the Islamic nations must concentrate on Islam."</p>
    <p align="justify">
      "The Muslims should keep the day of Quds alive." 
      <b>Imam Khomeini</b>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">The last Friday in the month of Ramadan is the Day of Quds. In remembrance of "al-Quds" Muslims worldwide should proclaim their support of the Islamic nation of Palestine. The holy city of Jerusalem is where the al-Aqsa Mosque, referred to as the remote mosque in the Qur'an is located.</p>
    <p align="justify">"Glory be to Him Who made His servant to go on a night from the Sacred Mosque to the remote mosque of which We have blessed the precincts, so that We may show him some of Our signs; surely He is the Hearing, the Seeing." Holy Qur'an (17:1)</p>
    <p align="justify">It was from this mosque that the Prophet ascended to heaven in order to observe the wonders therein. Near the mosque is the Dome of the Rock on which the hand print of the Angel Gabrial, who accompanied Prophet Mohammad (s) on his journey, still remains. This sacred, holy land has been usurped by Zionist Jews. United, the Muslims of the world will one day soon (God willing) liberate al-Quds.</p>
    <p align="justify">Realizing the importance of publicity, the Zionists deliberately altered historical facts in a chaotic and insinuating manner. This caused many Muslims to doubt their religious background. It also depicted that anyone who defended his country as a terrorist in order to justify the massacres that were planned to evacuate the land. Eventually, Palestine became "A land without a people" owned by a "A people without a land".</p>
    <p align="justify">In their cultural invasion against the Islamic nation of Palestine, the Zionists used religion as their main weapon. They planted spies among the people and spread their propaganda through the country, beginning a psychological invasion of this Islamic nation.</p>
    <p align="justify">Adopting a nationalistic pose, Zionists claimed to be the "Jewish Nation" which was established by Abrahim (a). In order to confirm this they tampered with the Old Testament or (Torah), and created their own history books.</p>
    <p align="justify">The Zionists knew that their movement must find a place to settle in. With the help of America and England they chose Palestine and it became their 'Promised Land'. They figured that the Muslims there could not defend themselves as it is a poor land. When they immigrated to Palestine, the Hebrew language was adapted and made the official language. After the usurping of Palestine in 1948 A.D., names were changed, Palestine became Israel, Al-Quds became Jerusalem, Khalij Al-Akaba became Khalij Suleiman, Safad became Safat, etc.</p>
    <p align="justify">Since publicity overwhelms the world, Zionistic movements monopolized international publicity and used it to defame and humiliate Muslims. Most of papers of the world are owned by these movements. For example, Time magazine points out in its issue of 1/21/1974, "There are 1700 newspapers in America, and Jews control 1,000 of them".</p>
    <p align="justify">The Zionist movement incarnated by "Nazi" thought has adapted its theoretical and practical applications. This is revealed in articles written by Jewish scholars in the "Modern Ages" French magazine. Zionist Jews have successfully spread propaganda which intends to justify the shedding of Arab blood and the killing of Arabs by any means whether by hanging, shooting or bombing residential areas.</p>
    <p align="justify">The Zionists believed that the Muslims were passive and could not successfully resist being low on arms and independent they could not defend themselves against their U.S. backed campaign. But they were proven wrong when Palestine was being usurped, bloody confrontations took place and changed the Zionists estimation of Muslims who proved to be fearless and ready to die in their struggle to regain their homeland and their human rights. Palestinians who are deprived of their homeland are now called terrorists so as to rouse public attention against them and justify mass killings of Palestinian people.</p>
    <p align="justify">The Palestinians has become the offering that must be sacrificed in order to set the spirit of the so-called 'Chosen people of God' at ease. The blood shed in "Sabra" and "Shatial" is one of the results of this.</p>
    <p align="justify">The Zionistic movement, that uprooted the Palestinians from their land and built a terrorist country on the remains, now feels threatened because one billion Muslims do not vouchsafe its existence. The Zionists have good reason to feel threatened as millions of Muslims prepare to liberate al-Quds. Surely the sun will shine once again over the Muslim nation of Palestine.</p>
    <p align="justify">Imam Khomeini the founder and the late leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran has declared the last Friday of the month of Ramadan as 'Quds Day'. Millions of Muslims march throughout the world on this day calling for the freedom and the return of the Muslim nation of Palestine which is under the oppression of Zionists.</p>
