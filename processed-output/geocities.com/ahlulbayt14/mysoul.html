      <pre>
        <p>You are the light of our eyes.Without you we are like orphans,somehow scared and heartbroken.Now we seek condolence in roses;we see you in their beautyand feel your smell intheir sweet scent.</p>
        <p>We are so honoured tobe a part of your nation.We love you dearly.We admire and envy thosewho love you even more.You know how one waits andlongs for meeting with thebeloved. That's how we arelonging for our meeting withyou in Paradise.We get encouraged and hopefulwith your saying "you are withthose whom you love" andeagerly wait for ourmeeting by the Riverof Kawthar.</p>
        <p>Our Lord the Exalted who createdyou and made you His Beloved and askedthe believers to love you and followyour example has taught us the prayersof invoking Allah's blessings on you tohelp ease our pain of missing you untilthe day we meet in Paradise.</p>
        <p>"Allah and His Angels send blessingson the Prophet. O you who believe!Send your blessings on him, and salutehim with all respect" (33:56).</p>
        <p>Every time we ask Allah to send HisPeace and Blessings on you we also feelthe blessings of Allah on us.We almost visualize the pigeonsof prayers that we set free inthe destination of Madinah reachingto your blessed garden of rest andyou holding and pitting them gently.</p>
        <p>The World Has Defeated UsThe world is a place of traveland we are the passers by.In this foreign land we oftentrip over and fall into traps.Our Lord, the Exalted, Who sentus to this world has made you ourguide. He told us to follow yourexample. We constantly rememberyour guidance not to make a wrongstep; striving to be like you wecontemplate on every issue and thinkhow you would have acted if you wereamong us now; how you would haveremembered and worshipped Allahor deal with people or eat and sleep.We consider you as more importantthan our own lives and love thosewho love and follow you.</p>
        <p>O the best of all the Prophets</p>
        <p>O the master of all messengersEven though we consider it thehighest honour to sacrifice ourlives in the cause of Islam, wehave a difficulty in breakingthe idol of our own ego. Youreminded us that the World withits sweetness and attractionsmay deceive us.</p>
        <p>You warned us of the danger ofattaching our hearts to the World.You told us that the world and allthat is in it is of no real value.You warned us against collectingworldly properties.You told us that we will be testedwith material gains and that thereal life we should strive for isthe Hereafter. You advised us tobe like a traveller passing by.You did exactly what you told usto do. There were time you did notfind a few pieces of date to eat.From the time you honoured Madinahuntil the day you passed away youdid not find to eat wheat breadconsecutively for three days.</p>
        <p>O Rasoolullah,</p>
        <p>O Habibullah,the world has defeated us.The world has become a giantand we became like the dwarfs.</p>
        <p>The Abolishment of Oppression</p>
        <p>O Rasoolullah,Our main goal is to striveagainst our ego, to reviveourselves with the guidanceyour brought, to live likea Muslim and to stay as a Muslim.The World is playing tricks on uscoming up in different costumes,telling us how to live our livesand what to do and how to dress.They do not give us the right tolive like a Muslim and like adignified human being. You haveabolished oppression with thereligion you brought and savedthe victims fragile necks fromthe bloody hands of oppressors.The way you saved humanityfourteen thousand years agofrom oppression and injustice.</p>
        <p>The victims, all their rightswere to be oppressed, revived.The oppressors, never thought offailure, died. Through the religionyou brought, the oppression hascollapsed. You were the answer forthe hopeless. You have brought thevalue that the human being deserves.Now the oppression awakened and witthe strength it gained, it is pressingdown on our throats. Every time weare faced with oppression we findthe condolence in you. We think ofthe oppression you had gone through,and can not help but think as if youcame to this world to endure hardship.Remembering that you were an orphanand all the other hardships you weretested with is like an ointment onour own injuries. We think of thetimes that you were seeking guidancein the mountain of Nur, tired of thedisorder in the World. We know thatthe bats who were scared of the lightthat you brought from the mountainswere disturbing you. Yet, you weresteadfast and patient despite allthis hardship. Just as we are aboutto sink in the swamp of irrationaloppression, we reach out to the Ropeof Allah that you brought for us.Once again we realize why Allah HadMade you our guide and example. Withthe pleasure of realizing that youare a mercy to the World we shed tears.</p>
        <p>From Humiliation to Exaltation</p>
        <p>O Rasulallah,</p>
        <p>O Habibullah,We learned how to be a dignified humanbeing from you. With the religion youbrought, Allah Exalted us from humiliationto sovereignty, from a hole to the citadel.When we embraced Islam Allah Made us thebest of nations. We became the superpowerthat others bent down on theirknees and opened their hands seeking help.In those magnificent times that we ruled,we followed your example in forbiddingevil and oppression and giving therights of the victims.Unfortunately, as we shifted away fromthe beauty of Islam we dried up, we gotoppressed, we bent down on our knees andopen our hands begging. Since then no onetakes us seriously nor treat us with aworthy treatment. We want to wake up andrevive and come back to our senses andraise from humiliation to sovereigntyand live as Muslims.</p>
        <p>O beloved of the World!We want our children to live likeMuslims, to follow your footsteps,and to be saved from the Hellfire,whose fuel will be people and stones.We want those who try to preventus from our way to have mercy on us,and to recognise us and to know thatwe want nothing but the pleasure ofAllah. We ask Allah to Give themguidance and to grant us patienceand success in our struggle.</p>
        <p>O Rasulallah,We truly want to be betterservants of Allah and betterbelievers again. We want to becomea nation you deserve and be proudof. We want to be those successfulbelievers who humble themselves intheir prayers; who avoid vain talk;who are active in giving Zakat; whoguard their modesty; who faithfullyobserve their trust and theircovenants; and who guard theirprayers (23:1-11). These days,one of the sayings that give ushope and keep us going is thatyou gave the glad tidings to thoseservants of Allah who are oppressedand are patient in enduring it willbe exalted by Allah. We have beenoppressed and humiliated and lookdown on. However, we believed thesovereignty belongs to Allah andHis Prophet and the believers (63:8).We pray to Allah to be among thosewho are patient and thus willreceive sovereignty and honorthat they deserve. We also prayto be among those who will besubjected to your intercessionon the day of judgement.</p>
