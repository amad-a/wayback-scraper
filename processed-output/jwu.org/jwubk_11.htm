          <i>EFFICIENCY IN THE UNDERTAKING</i>
        </center>
      </h2>
       In keeping up with its reputation as the most efficient Water Authority in the West Bank and Gaza, JWU continuously strives to improve its performance in all areas. The quality of a water service is measured not only by its effectiveness in providing a continuous, clean water supply to the consumer, but also by its efficiency in producing the water at minimum cost and providing it at reasonable prices. The determination of the real cost of water is a matter that involves the evaluation of every phase and aspect in the water supply and distribution system in search for least cost solutions. However, first the costs themselves must be studied in order to determine the major cost items so as to gain insight and determine the areas that should be given the most consideration and which will have the greatest effect on reducing the overall costs. JWU was one of five water utilities in the eastern Mediterranean region chosen by an international organization to participate in a water cost study. Two more studies dealing with cost recovery and affordability are underway in the Undertaking.

          <a name="_Toc342547251">EFFICIENCY MEASURES</a>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>To provide additional insight into the nature and characteristicsof the operation at JWU, efficiency measures have been calculatedwhich provide some additional data to support and complement thecost analysis.</p>
      <p>The efficiency measures used, include a number of indicators relatedto water consumption, the water distribution system, personneland unaccounted-for water (UFW). The values for these indicatorswere calculated for the five years in which costs were evaluated(1990 - 1994) and will be used in the cost analysis.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that in all indicators that use the populationserved as a basis of calculation, the population is divided intotwo parts. The local population includes all normal (single) usersand the population of the two local municipalities, Beitunia andBir Zeit, who purchase in bulk. The remaining population served,which includes the inhabitants of the six Israeli settlementsin the area and the official and military camps are estimatedat 10,000 inhabitants.</p>
      <p>The indicators address various areas of operation and performanceat JWU including Water Consumption, Water Distribution, Personnel,UFW and others. A review of the values provides some indicationon the nature of the JWU operation. In general, no significantchanges for the better or for the worse are indicated during thepast four years by these indicators. However, some general observationscan be made from these indicators:</p>

          Net water consumption in the area, at about 90 liters percapita/ day, is relatively low in comparison with published valuesfrom other countries. The net usage per connection, 22 m 
          <sup>3</sup>
           /connection/month,is still low but does not display such a high gap from the valuesof other countries due to the relatively large average familysize in the area (over 6 individuals/ connection).

      <ul>
        <li>The per capita consumption of people in the two municipalities(Beitunia and Bir Zeit) who purchase water in bulk is much higherthan that of the remaining local populations. Their consumptionis estimated at over 100 liters/capita/day, while that of theremaining local populations is about 90 liters/capita/day. Thereason for this is most likely that the consumption of the municipalitiesincludes the losses in the local distribution network and is alsodue to the consumption of Beir Zeit University.</li>
        <li>Although no data is available regarding the number of inhabitantsof the Israeli settlements, a conservative estimate of a totalof 9,000 individuals plus Israeli Security Forces living in armycamps would indicate a daily per capita consumption of about 300liters, almost four times that of the local populations.</li>
        <li>Other than the period 1991 - 1992 that is considered to bean abnormal period in which rare weather conditions affected thearea, the consumption habits of the local population have followedan increasing trend.</li>
        <li>The Ramallah region is considered to be relatively urbanizedand contains more industries than most areas in Palestine, however,the industrial water consumption and the commercial consumptionis 8.7% for both.</li>
        <li>The water supply/ km pipe/ day ratio has increased over thepast four years. While the length of the distribution networkhas increased by about 6.6% in the past four years, the totalsupply (produced and purchased water) has increased by about 20%during the same period.</li>
        <li>
          Personnel costs have on the whole increased in the past fouryears. The staff/[1000] water connection's ratio shows no apparenttrend, the [1000]m 
          <sup>3</sup>
           sold/year/staff has actually decreased slightly,the km pipe/staff ratio has decreased but this is probably a reflectionof the slowness of the network growth and the Intifada.
