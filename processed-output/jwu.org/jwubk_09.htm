          <em>UNACCOUNTED FOR WATER (UAFW)</em>
        </h2>
      </center>
       In the last 18 years, UAFW was gradually reduced from a peak level of 33% to its present level of 25%. While the Undertaking understands that this level is higher than internationally accepted ratios, it is much lower than other water authorities in the area. Recognizing the loss problem, JWU has embarked on an ambitious plan to replace the obsolete water network with the aim of reducing the present ratio to about 15% of the total water supply.

      <p>Many factors determine the quantity and percentage of UFW. Thesediffer from one network to another or even in the same network.The following tables show the water losses over the years 1991-1994and illustrate the reasons, percentages and the cost of UFW atJWU as recorded in 1994:</p>

           LOSSESIN MAIN SUPPLY LINES
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>These losses may be defined as the quantities of water lost inthe main lines between water sources and the distribution network.These losses are caused by leaks or damages to the lines due toexcessive water pressure, damage by external factors or corrosion.The percentage of this kind of loss is small because JWU startedto replace old deteriorated lines with new 6", 10",and 16" diameter pipes. These pipes are installed below theground surface at depths between 80 - 125 cm according to engineeringspecifications. Pressure is monitored in most of these lines throughelectronic control systems that signal the pumps when the pressureis nearing a dangerous level thus preventing the pipes from bursting.</p>

      <p>
        <b>LOSSES IN THE NETWORK</b>
      </p>
      <p>These losses constitute the quantity of water lost between themain supply lines and the consumers meters. These losses constitutethe highest percentage of water losses and can be credited tothe deterioration and aging of the pipelines which do not conformto standards and have been laid either exposed or more than twometers below ground surface. Water losses in the network can bedetected and traced by many methods, some of which are the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Direct observation by the public or by JWU employees</li>
        <li>Assumption that old pipelines are either damaged or deteriorated.</li>
        <li>Inspection of consumer's water meters</li>
        <li>Installing main water meters at the entrance of each localityand comparing the readings with the total of all consumer metersof that locality. The difference in the readings can be consideredas water losses and can be dealt with on a priority basis.</li>
        <li>Performing a general survey using electronic leak detectionin suspected localities.</li>
      </ul>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>LOSSES IN METERS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Water losses in meters can be defined as the quantity of waterthat is consumed by consumers but not recorded by the meters.The reasons for these losses may be credited to the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The accuracy of the 1/2" meters in use is + or - 2% ata flow rate of 22.7 liter per hour when installed. However, withpassage of time, the meter may stop recording due to failure inits internal gears.</li>
        <li>Water supplied to consumers is usually stored in small tanksbuilt on their roofs. These tanks lower the water flow throughmeters and since the 1/2" meter does not record any flowless than 3.4 l/h, a large quantity of water is not recorded andis thus recorded as losses.</li>
        <li>Meter accuracy is reduced due to scale deposits on the internalgears or to dirt.</li>
      </ul>

        <b>BLACK LOSSES</b>
      </p>
      <p>The illegal consumption of water has increased in the last fewyears due to lack of law enforcement and to the hard economicaland social circumstances in the area. JWU is combating this trendby raising the awareness of the consumers and by increasing inspectionand imposing penalties on the violators.</p>
      <p>

      <p>
        <b>WATER LOSSES DETECTION</b>
      </p>
      <p>A simple method is used by JWU to detect the exact quantity ofwater losses in private meters. Main standard meters were installedon different main lines supplying certain sectors of consumers.By comparing the consumption recorded by private meters with thaton the main meter, it appeared that the recorded quantities ofwater flowing through private meters were on the average 11.3%less than the quantities of water flowing through the main standardmeters. This difference shows the actual water losses which privatemeters fail to record.</p>

           FUTUREPLANS IN THE METER SECTION
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Customer Relations Unit</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is perhaps one of the most important developments requiredin the organizational structure of JWU. Constant interruptionsby subscribers with complaints and other requests plague manyemployees. In addition, conflicting answers to the subscribersquestions do not give a good image of JWU's organization. TheCustomer Relations Unit should deal directly with all customercomplaints and requests and follow the necessary procedures toexecute the requests and answer their questions without requiringthe customer to speak with any other individual at JWU exceptin extreme cases.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Monitoring of Consumer Consumption for Irregularities</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since consumer consumption is already entered into the computerfor billing purposes, this information should be used to monitorconsumption and automatically report on irregularities. Limitsshould be set as 'normal' consumption (say, plus or minus 20%of the average consumption of the specific consumer) and allowancesmade for seasonal changes (an increase in the expected consumptionin summer). Any consumption outside these limits should be checked.The responsibility for this activity should be assigned to theCustomer Services Division (Meters).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Incentives for Collectors</b>
      </p>
      <p>In order to decrease the number of unpaid bills and control thetime the meter bill collectors spend in the field, incentiveson bill collecting should be implemented. Bill collectors shouldbe given a bonus based on number of bills and amounts collected.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Installation of Main Water Meters</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Undertaking prepared a project to install main water metersat the entrances of villages and distribution localities in orderto compare the reading from these meters with the collective readingof all the meters in each village or locality. This action, willdetermine the amount of water losses and possibly its location.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Installation of Water Meter Test Bench</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Undertaking recognizes the need for improving the efficiencyof its water meters, hence it introduced a project to purchasea new improved water meter test bench. This test bench has thecapability to test 50 meters at one time which will make it feasibleand possible for the Undertaking to test a much larger numberof consumer meters in order to maintain the efficiency and accuracyof these meters.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Data Terminals for Meter Readers and Collectors</b>
      </p>
      <p>This will increase the number of meters read daily ( currently85 meters per reader per day) by 70%-100% . Additionally, thereadings gathered by the readers will be entered into the computersystem automatically.</p>
