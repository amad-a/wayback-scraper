       For the last 28 years, JWU built up an excellent reputation locally and internationally. JWU was mentioned in the World Bank Report (Volume V) that was published in September 1993 more than once as the most efficient and best run water authority in the West Bank and Gaza. Jerusalem Water Undertaking with its limited capabilities and human resources, plays a major role in participating in major activities whether initiated by JWU or by the communities it serves.

           ATTHE NATIONAL LEVEL
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The following are samples of some JWU activities:</p>
      <p>
        <b>National Public Awareness Campaign.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With the participation of many Agencies and Non-Governmental Organizations,and the UNDP, an awareness network was established to make thepublic aware of the water shortage problems and how to rationthe use of it. JWU established an in house committee to find waysand means to polish the image of the Undertaking and coordinatethe awareness efforts with the established network. It is importantto mention that a work plan has been designed and parts of itwill be implemented in the coming years. The main points of thiswork plan are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Selecting the target groups for the awareness campaign toration the use of water</li>
        <li>Improving the image of the Undertaking</li>
        <li>Improve the awareness of the Undertaking's employees in asfar as the Undertaking's local, national and international activities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Also, the JWU Board of Directors decided to participate with municipalitiesand other organizations in the region to facilitate the work ofthe Solid Waste and Waste Water Treatment Committee that was establishedwith the full support of the GTZ and the UNDP. The committee'smain function is to look for the most efficient ways and meansto dispose of solid waste in a safe manner.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Training</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jerusalem Water Undertaking realizes the importance of improvingthe capacity of the water sector employees in general and itshuman resources in specific. Keeping up with modern methods thatmeet international standards necessitates having appropriate trainingprogram in place, to meet the training requirements of the Undertaking.JWU sees itself in the near future as a regional training centerin the Water and Waste Water fields. International organizationssuch as the World Bank, GTZ and CDG and UNDP are working withthe Undertaking to develop a training concept and facilities thatwill benefit the Undertaking and the region as a whole.</p>
      <p>CDG planned a training workshop that was held in Bethlehem inMarch of 1995 for which JWU was a facilitator. JWU professionalsand other organizations in the West Bank and Gaza were invitedto come up with a training program in the water and waste waterfields. The outcome of the workshop was a comprehensive reporton training in the fields of water supply and waste water management.Problems and training needs have been identified and a trainingprogram was developed.</p>
      <p>GTZ on the other hand signed an agreement with JWU in which improvingthe management and staff skills is one of the results expectedafter three years.</p>
      <p>JWU conducted a training program for staff from 6 West Bank villages.This training session, was funded by the UNDP and it requiredthe participation of more than 20 management and staff membersfrom JWU to conduct training lectures after work hours and onthe job training for 6 weeks. The participants of this trainingsession benefited greatly and UNDP was extremely pleased withthe results of this training. A training booklet for techniciansand accountants was published by JWU. It included the lectures,the training materials, diagrams, specifications and methods tobe followed in managing the small scale water utilities. Anothergroup from two villages also sponsored by the UNDP started trainingat the Undertaking in October 1995.</p>
      <p>Additionally, JWU is constantly providing on the job trainingfor graduates of educational and vocational institutions in theWest Bank. These graduates gain the knowledge provided by themany years of experience the employees of JWU posses and go intothe work market prepared in their fields.</p>
      <p>JWU is also very keen on providing training for its own staff.During the last few years a number of its employees were sentabroad for administrative and technical training and many participatedin courses sponsored by local universities and continuing educationinstitutions, to enhance their knowledge and expand their knowhow.</p>
      <p>JWU initiated and implemented a rotating employment program for2-6 months periods to absorb some of the community un employedand provide training to the graduates of education and vocationalinstitutions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Workshops</b>
      </p>
      <p>During the last few years, JWU was a major contributor and participantin many workshops held locally and abroad. These workshops weresponsored by either local or international organizations and coveredfield such as integration of water and sewerage authorities, waterresources management, rehabilitation of water networks, waterauthorities institutional development, public awareness, watercost, water saving and planning for the training needs of thewater authorities in the area. In all events, JWU was chosen toparticipate in these workshops due to its favorable reputationand its wealth of technical and administrative knowledge and thereadiness of its management and staff to contribute to the improvementof their organization.</p>
