      <bold>Introduction:</bold>
       Jerusalem Water Undertaking has to purchase more than 60% of its current drinking water supply from the Israeli Authorities. Even with these quantities, there was a real water shortage in the JWU distribution area during the last years which caused JWU to ration water supplies to the different areas. JWU sees a diehard reason for increasing the water sources in the area to accommodate the increasing demand for water especially since there will be an expected population increase because of the peace effort in the area. Hydrologists and Hydrogeological engineers pointed out certain sites in which drilling for water should commence. One of these sites is the Ein Samia well field which is located in the Eastern Groundwater Basin. After drilling Well No. 6 in this area, it is believed that any further drilling in this vicinity will not be productive.

        <i>Ein Samia Well Field (Ein Samia Plains)</i>
      </center>
      <p>The Western Groundwater Basin of the West Bank is considered asone unit called the Nahr El-Auja-Tamaseeh Basin. Water is dischargedseaward beneath the coastal plain. The annual renewable rechargeof this basin is between 335-380 MCM. A small portion of the rainwaterthat seeps through the exposed parts of the Cenomanian and Turonianaquifers in the Western Groundwater Basin flows in springs drainingthe sloping aquifers - but most of the water reaches the regionalaquifer and it is tapped by wells on both sides of the 1948 ArmisticeLine between the Palestinian Territory's West Bank and Israel- with the greater usage being now on the Israeli side.</p>
      <p>From Israel's own reporting, it is stated that the high usageby the Israelis of the Western Groundwater Basin is causing thewater level in this Western Basin to drop 0.79-1.03 meters/year.To keep the majority of the water of this aquifer for themselves,the Israeli government, who of course also controls the landsin the West Bank through its military forces and military laws,prevents Palestinian farmers (especially in the western half ofthe West Bank) from drilling new wells for agriculture and restrictrehabilitation and maintenance of their old wells.</p>
      <p>Although most of the groundwater of the West Bank's Western Basinarea is actually under the western part of the West Bank, thesewater resources are used in the water supply of Israel as mentionedabove. The amount of water provided by this western basin of theWest Bank supplies about 25% of Israel's total water supply througheither natural discharge or by wells pumping within Israel. Theoveruse and misuse of this water basin by the Israelis is oneof the most sensitive issues between Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
      <p>The service area of the Jerusalem Water Undertaking (JWU) is partiallylocated on this Palestinian Western Groundwater Basin. Despitethe need for water in the area, the Israeli government did notallow during the 28 years of occupation any water resource developmentfor JWU in this western part of the watershed.</p>
      <p>Prior to the 1967 Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the Jordaniangovernment did however drill five exploratory wells in the WesternBasin in 1964 in order to test and monitor the availability ofwater in the area for the JWU. In fact, a pumping test was doneon exploratory well No. 2 in the Shibteen area on May 6, 1967,only one month before the occupation. Since 1967, three of theseexploratory wells have been capped and two are being pumped bythe Israelis and these two wells serve about 22 villages and 6Israeli settlements under the jurisdiction of the West Bank WaterDepartment of the Israeli military government's civil administrationand do not contribute in any way to the water distribution networkunder the jurisdiction of JWU.</p>
      <p>JWU was supposed to utilize the Shibteen well field for the futuredemand of the central part of Palestine since it is obvious thatthe only water source left for fulfilling the demand is the WesternBasin.</p>
      <p>During the peace talks, the Palestinian negotiators insisted ontheir surface and groundwater rights in the West Bank, especiallyin the Western Basin.</p>

      <p>The following are the ongoing activities and future plans to overcomethe water shortages in JWU's area of supply and to bring to anend the Undertaking's dependency on purchased water:</p>
      <p>
        1. Well No. 2a at Ein Samia.

        <b>
          To replace the old irrigation well with new 
          <br>higher yield Well:</b>
         The drilling, civil works, electrical works,pumping equipment and performance tests are completed. The Wellwill be fully operational by December 1, 1995. Funding is fromthe German Government through GTZ

      <p>
        2. Well No. 3 at Ein Samia.
