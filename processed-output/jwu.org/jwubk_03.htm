      Jerusalem Water Undertaking is located in the Ramallah District of the Palestinian Territories. This district includes one major urban area, the twin cities of Ramallah / El-Bireh, and about 100 villages, municipalities and refugee camps. The region that obtains its water services from the Jerusalem Water Undertaking includes the Ramallah / El-Bireh cities, four other municipalities, 40 villages and 5 refugee camps. (The remaining villages in the Ramallah District that are not served by JWU are either provided with water by the Israeli Civil Administration or not yet served ). The served area extends over 500 square kilometers and includes over 25,000 connections serving a population of over 200,000 people.

        <b>HISTORICAL REVIEW</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Until the later 1950s, the population of Ramallah and El-Birehdepended almost entirely on cisterns for drinking water with theexception of a few local springs. Following the war of 1948 andthe resulting influx of Palestinian refugees into the area, theneed to increase the water supply in the region became vital.Thus the Ramallah / El-Bireh Water Company was established todeal with this burden and supply water to the area. The new companyplanned to draw on Ein-Fara Springs northeast of Jerusalem andsucceeded in concluding an agreement with Arab east JerusalemMunicipality. 
        <br>
        A distribution network and a main pipeline were constructed forthe purpose of conveying water from Jerusalem to the Ramallah/ El-Bireh area. The limited quantities of water were insufficientfor the population of these communities and search for new watersources is necessary.
      </p>
      <p>In 1963, the Jordanian government concluded an agreement withthe International Development Agency (IDA) for a loan of $3.5millions to develop drinking water projects in parts of the Kingdom.The government decided to utilize the underground water at Ein-Samiaand started to build what later became known as the Ein-SamiaWater Project.</p>
      <p>Pursuant to the agreement made between the Jordanian governmentand IDA, a law was issued in 1966 for the establishment of theJerusalem Water Undertaking (Ramallah District) with authorityto develop new water resources and control all water projectsin the area and with the responsibility of providing the populationwith potable water. According to this law, the JWU was establishedas a non-profit, independent, civil organization run by a Boardof Directors which includes representatives from the three mainmunicipalities in the area.</p>
      <p>Since the occupation in 1967, the Israeli authorities subjectedall works and projects pertaining to water and water resourcesto its direct supervision or control through the military orderNo. 92/1967. The said order prevented any organization or undertakingfrom the execution of any work connected with the running, management,maintenance or development of water services or resources withoutthe prior approval and licensing from the Israeli military authorities.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in 1982 the Israeli occupation authorities dissolvedthe city councils of Ramallah and El-Bireh thus disabling theJWU Board of Directors that consists of two members from eachcity from performing its duties. For five years and without theBoard of Directors, the general manager took it on his part tomake all the daily and strategic decisions to achieve the Undertaking'sgoals and proceed with its strategic plans.</p>
      <p>At the end of 1987, the Intifada started in the Occupied PalestinianTerritories. The whole political, social and financial situationin the area changed. Many people became out of work thus puttingextra burden on the Undertaking as far as collecting water feesfrom the consumers. Even through these tough days of Intifada,the Undertaking managed to survive and even came out strongerthan ever.</p>
      <p>JWU expected production for 1996 will exceed 5.0 MCM of water.Since the total supply required will exceed 10 MCM, JWU will purchasethe remaining quantity, about 50% of its total supply, from theIsraeli company Mekeroth and the Jerusalem Municipality. In 1993(before the operation of Well No. 4 and the utilization of thenewly drilled well no. 2 and the upgrading of well no. 3) thispercentage was even higher with 70% of JWU's supply purchasedfrom outside sources. This problem of insufficient resources isthe greatest problem faced by JWU and is clearly reflected inthe annual shortages that occur especially at the onset of thesummer season.</p>

        <b>Legal Status of JWU</b>
      </p>
      <p>Law No. 9 for the year 1966 was issued providing for the establishmentof an Undertaking under the name of Jerusalem Water Undertaking(Ramallah District) empowered to develop new water resources andcontrol all water projects in the area and entrusted to provideall the water needs for drinking and other municipal and domesticpurposes. According to the stated law, JWU was authorized to prescribewater tariffs, cost of services, collection procedures, financial,administrative and technical regulations to be approved by itsBoard of Directors.</p>
      <p>The JWU Board of Directors has introduced regulations and by-lawsto regulate all aspects of activities such as procurement, stores,employees and fees. It has been noticed that JWU regulations andby-laws do not cover certain activities that usually lie underthe responsibility of water utilities in the absence of any otherregulatory body, such as those activities that might have a negativeimpact on water resources, environment, safety regulations, technicalstandards and specifications as well as the licensing of contractorsworking in this field.</p>
      <p>Also, its envisaged that the existing regulations must be amendedif the responsibility for wastewater collection, treatment andreuse is transferred totally or partially to JWU ( after the evaluationstudies taking place presently in this concern are completed andfound feasible).</p>
