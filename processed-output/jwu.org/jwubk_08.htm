       JWU used a variety of 1/2 inch water meter types in the past years ( such as ROLEX, POLEX, SOLONGEN, ANDRIA, PHL, ANISBACH, RAUTER and others), which depend on the water velocity to measure the flow. KENT volumetric water meters are in use at JWU since 1966. They have a great degree of accuracy and ease of maintenance with possibilities of direct reading by the consumers. Also, locally produced [1 and 16] inch meters in diameter were used to facilitate maintenance and avoid difficulties of import from abroad.

      <p>Presently, the Undertaking has about 24000 KENT water meters inuse, and about 300 Israeli made and other types of meters. KENTwater meters are made and imported from the United Kingdom. Themeters have proved to be the best and have many technical advantagesover the other types. KENT meters have the volumetric Rotary-Pistonprinciple of measurement ensuring a remarkable accuracy of registrationeven at the very lowest rates of flow. The water flowing throughthe meter, drives the circular piston in an eccentric path aroundan accurately machined thermoplastic measuring or working chamber,each revolution representing the transfer of a known quantityof water. The rotary action of the piston is transferred to adog drive coupling from which it is transmitted to the combinedreduction gear and counter unit. The combined counter and gearunit is fully sealed, vacuum filled, with a simple straight-readingpresentation.</p>
      <p>When KENT meters were compared with other in-use meters, theywere found to be more accurate and have a longer lifetime in additionto being easy to dismantle and maintain. KENT Meters have a uniqueadvantage over other meters, they can be mounted either verticallyor horizontally with the same efficiency and accuracy.</p>
