          <em>THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF JWU</em>
        </center>
      </h2>
       The current organizational structure of JWU is the result of years of minor adjustments and changes to the original structure. Thus, the current structure does not properly reflect the distribution of functions and responsibilities among divisions and employees within the organization. JWU management recognizes these defects and sets its goals to achieve improvements in clearly defining the levels within the structure, structuring the lower levels, proper distribution of functions among organizational sections, separating customer services division and creating an Administrative Division that will report directly to the General Manager and bringing together existing functions such as the secretarial and computer services, as well as personnel and public relations.

      </p>
      <p>Administrative Affairs are run by a team of aides attached tothe General Manager's office. Presently, three sections reportdirectly to the Manager:</p>
      <p>the Computer Section is running two Local Area Networks ( LANs) operating 24 hours a day. The capacity of these networks is4.5 GB. They support 25 concurrent users working on accounting,engineering, invoicing, storing, personnel, word processing, transportand technical services. The hardware and software in this sectionare upgraded constantly to keep up with modern software programs,thus improving the efficiency and the performance at JWU.</p>
      <p>The Secretarial and General Services Section handles most of theday-to-day secretarial activities in JWU. All of the word processing,typing and filing takes place in this section. Consumers records,contracts, national and international aid and all other kindsof files are kept and maintained in this section.</p>
