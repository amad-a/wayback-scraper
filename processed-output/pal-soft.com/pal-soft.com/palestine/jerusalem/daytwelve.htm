Jewish  settlers  abducted  a  Palestinian  farmer  Isam Judeh Mustafa
Hamed, 47 years old , from his olive orchard, took him to their nearby
settlement,  bludgeoned  him to death with clubs and axes and then set
his mutilated body on fire.
Two  Palestinians  were  killed  and  many  were  injured when a Jewis
settlers   attacked   Arab   homes   and  Businesses  in  Nazareth  in
1948-Palestine  Sunday  night. Omar Muhammed Akkawi, 42 years old, and
Wisam  Yazbak,  22,  were shot dead , two other Palestinians sustained
critical injuries.
Jewish settlers, armed with automatic rifles, axes, and clubs, went to
Hebron  for  the  third consecutive night, smashing the windshields of
Arab cars and firing heavily on Arab windows.
Jewish  settlers  continued  their attacks on Palestinians within East
Jerusalem,  shooting  live ammunition, rubber coated steel bullets and
smashing  cars  and  shops.  Two Palestinians were martyred . They are
Abdul  Hameed  Tayeh,  of  al Mazra'a al Sharkiyya , and Ali Sayel ali
Ishak from Azzoun .
It  has  been  reported  that the Palestinian Authority had started to
prevent   Palestinian   citizens   from  throwing  stones  at  Israeli
occupation  troops.  Policemen  drew  back  the demonstrators from the
Nitsarim juncture while the Israeli soldiers continued to fire at them
injuring 12.
Tanks  and armored military vehicles were deployed along the Jerusalem
main  road near Shufat and Beit Hanina. A number of injuries have been
reported.  Moreover, Jewish setterls, who have apparently given a free
rein  to  attack  unarmed  Palestinians,  continued to rampage through
isolated Arab villages and hamlets.
The  Israeli  foreign  ministry has asked families of its diplomats in
the Arab countries to return home immediately,
