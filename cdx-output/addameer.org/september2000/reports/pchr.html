<br><br>“Journalists engaged in dangerous professional missions in areas of 
armed conflict shall be considered as civilians … They shall be

August 1949 ‘Protocol 1.’) ------- 

<br><br>Introduction: 

<br><br>
Since the outbreak of what has come to be known as "Al-Aqsa Intifada," 
journalists and reporters of local and international press agencies 
have not been immune to blatant violations perpetrated by the Israeli 
occupation forces against defenseless Palestinian civilians. Many of 
these journalists, especially photographers and cameramen who were 
covering the incidents of Al-Aqsa Intifada, were chased, intimidated 
and shot by the Israeli occupation forces. Shooting at international 
and local journalists and reporters, to hinder their covering of these 
incidents, has become a prominent aspect of a policy adopted by the 
Israeli occupation forces, which aims at hiding their crimes and 
killings against defenseless Palestinian civilians. These particular 
actions escalated after waves of criticism directed at the Israeli 
government by the international community and public opinion. Million 
of people watched on television stations the willful cold-blooded 
killing of Palestinian children and young men by the Israeli 
occupation forces, especially the assassination of the child Mohammed 
Al-Durreh at Al-Shuhada’ (Netzarim) junction in the Gaza Strip. This 
child was assassinated before the eyes of the world, as a brave 
journalist covered it for all television stations in the world. This 
crime has shaken all human feelings, and has revealed the real face of 
a racist and inhumane occupation. 

<br><br>Despite the consensus of the international community that journalists 
must be protected while carrying out their duties, the Israeli 
occupation forces, on several occasions willfully shot at them while 
they were covering clashes of Al-Aqsa Intifada, in a blatant violation 
of relevant international conventions and law. These practices come 
as a tangible expression of slighting international law and 
international humanitarian law by the Israeli occupation forces. 
These laws ensure, inter alia, the protection of journalists and the 
right to receive and impart information as preconditions to 
implementing the right to a free press. The following section surveys 
significant practices by the Israeli occupation forces against 
journalists since the outbreak of clashes between Palestinian 
civilians and the Israeli occupation forces. 


<br><br>Israeli Practices against Journalists: 

<br><br>Israeli occupation forces shot at journalists and staff of 
international and local press agencies on several occasions during the 
period of September 28-November 20, 2000. These shootings are 
summarized below. 

<br><br>On September 29, 2000: 
<br>A unit of the Israeli occupation forces beat the journalist Khaled Abu 
Akar, correspondent of France 2 and correspondent of The New York 
Times, when he was covering clashes between Palestinian civilians and 
the Israeli occupation forces inside Al-Haram Al-Sharif (the Holy 
Sanctuary). The incident took place when Abu Akar refused to hand a 
rubber-coated metal bullet he found on the ground to an Israeli 
soldier. Israeli soldiers started to beat the mentioned journalist 
with sticks. On the same day, while he was covering the same clashes, 
the journalist Mahfouzh Abu Turk, a cameraman of France 2, was wounded 
with a rubber-coated metal bullet in the left side, shot by the 
Israeli occupation forces inside Al-Haram Al-Sharif. This incident 
took place while Abu Turk was photographing clashes between 
Palestinian civilians and the Israeli occupation forces from behind a 
stone bar inside Al-Haram Al-Sharif. Soldiers of the Israeli 
occupation forces also beat journalist Khaled Zaghri, a photographer 
of Reuters, while he was covering the same clashes. The journalist 
Hazem Bader, a photographer of the Associated Press, was wounded with 
a rubber-coated metal bullet in the right eye. Soldiers of the 
Israeli occupation forces also beat Awadh Awadh, a photographer of 
Agence France Presse, and tried to break his photography equipment, 
while he was covering the same clashes. 

<br><br>In Hebron, the Israeli occupation forces shot at Aamer El-Jabari, a 
reporter of NBC, wounding him with a bullet in the head, while he was 
covering clashes between Palestinian civilians and the Israeli 
occupation forces. The wounded reporter was evacuated to Hadasa 
hospital. The Israeli occupation forces also shot at Naji Dana, a 
cameraman of France 2, wounding him with a rubber-coated metal bullet, 
while he was covering the same clashes. The Israeli occupation forces 
beat Luai Abu Haikal, a reporter of Reuters, and wounded Wael 
El-Shiokhi, an independent journalist, with a rubber-coated metal 
bullet in the side. Read Awadh, a cameraman of the Palestinian 
television channel Watan, was wounded by a bullet in the foot. 

<br><br>Rami Noufal, a reprter of the Palestinian Broadcasting Station, was 
beaten by Israeli occupation troops at a roadblock stationed by these 
troops in Bethlehem. 

<br><br>In Gaza, the Israeli occupation forces beat Wafiq Mattar, a journalist 
of the Palestinian Political Steering Bueau, injuring him in several 
parts of the body. 

<br><br>On September 30, 2000: 
<br>The Southern Commander of the Israeli army Yom Tov Samia, issue a 
decision preventing all those of Israeli nationality, including 
journalists and reporters, from entering the areas of the Palestinian 
National Authority. This decision aimed at hiding facts about what was 
taking place in the occupied Palestinian territories, and preventing 
Arab citizens in Israel from learning what was going on there. 
<br><br>
Mouaffaq Turki Qassem Mattar, 46 years old, a photographer of 
Falasteen Al-Yawm (Palestine Today) Press in Ramallah, was wounded 
with a rubber-coated metal bullet in the head, while he was covering 
clashes between Palestinian civilians and the Israeli occupation 
forces near Al-Shuhada’ (Netzarim) junction to the south of Gaza City. 

<br><br> On October 2, 2000: 
<br>The car of Mawan El-Ghoul, a cameraman of CBC, and director of Mayadin 
Company for Media and Television Production, was shelled by an Israeli 
combat helicopter. It was completely destroyed. This incident took 
place near Al-Shuhada’ (Netzarim) junction in the Gaza Strip, while 
El-Ghoul was covering clashes between Palestinian civilians and the 
Israeli occupation forces. El-Ghoul stated that his car was 
distinguished from all cars in the area as a press car by identifying 
signs in Arabic and English. Inside the car, there was photography 
equipment estimated to be valued at no less than US$ 20,000. 

<br><br>Hazem Bader, a photographer of the Associated Press, was wounded with 
a live bullet in the right hand, shot by the Israeli occupation 
forces, while he was covering clashes between Palestinian civilians 
and these forces inside Al-Haram Al-Sharif. 

<br><br>Israeli occupation troops shot at Mazen Dana, a photographer of 
Reuters, wounding him with a rubber-coated metal bullet in the right 
leg, while he was covering clashes between the Palestinian civilians 
and the Israeli occupation forces in El-Shallala street in Hebron. 

<br><br>On October 4, 2000: 
<br>Atta Oweisat, a photographer of Zoom 77 press agency, was beaten and 
humiliated by Israeli occupation troops, while he was covering a 
funeral procession of a Palestinian martyr, Mohammed El-Sarkhi, in the 
village of Jabal El-Mukabber near Jerusalem. Oweisat stated that a 
group of seven Israeli soldiers attacked him, forced him to lie down 
and started hitting him in the stomach and neck. As a result, he 
fainted and was evacuated to hospital. He left hospital on the same 
day. 

<br><br>On October 9, 2000: 
<br>Israeli occupation troops shot rubber-coated metal bullets at Luce 
Delahye, a photographer of Newsweek, hitting and damaging the lens of 
his camera. The incident took place while he was covering clashes 
between Palestinian civilians and the Israeli occupation forces in 
Ramallah. A week later, in the same city, Delahye was wounded by a 
rubber-coated metal bullet in the forehead, while he was photographing 
a young Palestinian man who had been wounded by a live bullet in the 
head during clashes between Palestinian civilians and the Israeli 
occupation forces. 

<br><br>On October 14, 2000: 
<br>The car of journalists Hssan El-Titi and Abdel-Rahman Qousini, of the 
Associated Press, was attacked by Jewish settlers near the village of 
Hawwara near Nablus. The front part of the car and its glass were 
crushed. 

<br><br>On October 17, 2000: 
<br>
For the second time, the Israeli occupation forces shot at Mahfouzh 
Abu Turk, a photographer of Reuters, wounding him with a rubber-coated 
metal bullet in the hand. This incident took place while Abu Turk was 
covering clashes between Palestinian civilians and the Israeli 
occupation forces in Bethlehem after a funeral procession of a 
Palestinian martyr. Abu Turk was evacuated to Beit Jala hospital for 
treatment and left the hospital on the same day. 

<br><br>On October 18, 2000: 
<br>
Israeli occupation troops shot at Patrick Baz, a photographer of 
France Press, wounding him with a rubber-coated metal bullet in the 
hand. This incident took place while he was covering clashes between 
Palestinian civilians and the Israeli occupation forces in Ramallah. 
Eyewitnesses asserted that Baz was with another photographer and was 
wearing a helmet and a bulletproof vest, and that it was clear that he 
was a journalist photographing clashes between Palestinian civilians 
and the Israeli occupation forces. 

<br><br>On October 20, 2000: 
<br>
Israeli occupation forces shot at Abdel-Rahman El-Khatib, a 
photographer of Al-Ayyam daily local newspaper, wounding him with a 
rubber-coated metal bullet in the mouth. This incident took place 
while El-Khatib was covering clashes between Palestinian civilians and 
the Israeli occupation forces near a military post of the Israeli 
occupation forces known as “Al-Nouria,” to the west of the refugee 
camp of Khan Yunis. El-Khatib informed PCHR that on Friday, October 
20, 2000, while he was photographing clashes between Palestinian 
civilians and the Israeli occupation forces near Neve Dekalim 
settlement from behind a big stone, he was shot with a rubber-coated 
metal bullet in the mouth by the Israeli occupation forces. Following 
this, El-Khatib was evacuated to hospital where physicians found an 
injury in the upper lip, and a break in the right part of the upper 
teeth. 

<br><br>Hammed Eghbareya, director of Sawt Al-Haq Walhorreya (the Voice of 
Right and Freedom) in Nazareth, was attacked by Israeli police and 
border guards while he was covering clashes between them and Arab 
citizens. Israeli troops shot at Mahfouzh Abu Turk, a journalist from 
Jerusalem, wounding him with a bullet in the shoulder. 

<br><br>On October 21, 2000: 
<br>Jacques-Marie Bourget, a reporter of Paris Match, was wounded with a 
live bullet in the left lung shot by the Israeli occupation forces, 
while he was covering clashes between these forces and Palestinian 
civilians in Ramallah. Bourget was evacuated to Ramallah governmental 
hospital in serious condition before being transferred to Paris for 
treatment. Thierry Esch, a photographer for the same magazine, who was 
behind Bourget, stated to his magazine that there was no doubt that it 
was Israeli occupation troops that shot Bourget. Patrick Jarnoux, an 
editor of the same magazine, stated to The Toronto Star, that based on 
the place where Bourget was, no one could hurt him except those who 
were in front of him -- namely, the Israeli occupation troops. 

<br><br>Israeli occupation troops shot at Bruno Stephen, an independent 
photographer of the French Liberation and the German Stern, and nearly 
wounded him in the throat. This incident took place while Stephen was 
covering clashes. During the same clashes, another two journalists 
were moderately to seriously wounded. They are: Ibrahim Al-Hosari, of 
Watan Television Channel, who was wounded with a bullet in the ear; 
and Jamal Aarori, a photographer of Al-Ayyam daily local newspaper, 
who was wounded with a rubber-coated metal bullet in the hand. 

<br><br>On October 23, 2000: 
<br>The Israeli occupation forces prevented the access of Nasser Shiokhi, 
a correspondent and a photographer of Associated Press, to the village 
of Al-Sammoua near Hebron. He was attempting to cover clashes taking 
place at the time between Palestinian civilians and the Israeli 
occupation forces. These forces also confiscated his press identity 
card. 

<br><br>On October 24, 2000: 
<br>Jewish settlers near the village of Hawwara in Nablus attacked the car 
of Abdel-Rahman Khbeisa, a photographer of the Associated Press, with 
a huge rock that could easily have killed him. Khbeisa stated that he 
was surprised by a huge stone that weighed about 10 kilograms being 
thrown at his car from a blue Subaru of Jewish settlers. The front of 
his car and the front glass were hit. He miraculously escaped death 
as he was driving his car at high speed and the stone was huge. This 
incident took place in front of a feed factory at the entrance of the 
village of Hawwara, while Khbeisa was on his way to work. 

<br><br> On October 29, 2000: 
<br>Israeli occupation troops shot at three journalists who were 
travelling by car to Jericho hospital to see patients who were wounded 
during clashes between Palestinian civilians and the Israeli 
occupation forces in the refugee camp of Aqbat Jaber near Jericho. 
They journalists are: 1) Aadel Abu Abu Naeima, a correspondent of 
Al-Ayyam daily local newspaper and Reuters; 2) Fathi Brahma, a 
correspondent of Sawt Fasteen (Voice of Palestine); and 3) Emad Abu 
Sonbol, a correspondent of Al-Hayat Al-Jadida daily local newspaper 
and France Press. It is worth mentioning that none of the 
above-mentioned journalists were hurt. 

<br>On October 31, 2000: 
<br>The Israeli occupation forces shot at Ben Wedeman, 41 years old, an 
American, and a correspondent of CNN, wounding him with a live bullet 
in the right side. He was evacuated to Shifa’ hospital. This 
incident took place near Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet, when Wedeman was 
covering clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and the Israeli 
occupation forces. Eyewitnesses asserted that Wedeman was wearing a 
helmet and a bulletproof vest. They added that the situation in the 
area was relatively calm, but it escalated when the Israeli occupation 
forces started to shoot intensively and "walk" tank shells in the 
direction of Wedeman and other journalists. Wedeman was forced to lie 
down to escape the shooting. A few minutes after the shooting 
started, and while he was trying to stand up with his back opposite to 
the Israeli occupation forces, he was wounded with a live bullet in 
the right side, and then was evacuated to Shifa’ hospital. 
<br><br>
Two hours earlier, the Israeli occupation forces shot at Sams 
Oudetallah, a cameraman of Reuters, but he was not injured. He ran 
from the area, leaving his equipment behind. 

<br><br>On the same day, the Israeli occupation forces arrested Suleiman 
Al-Shafe’i, a correspondent of Israeli television channel 2, at Erez 
Checkpoint, while he was on his way from Gaza to Israel. Soldiers of 
the Israeli occupation forces informed Al-Shafe’iy that he was in 
violation of the military orders that prohibited Israeli citizens from 
entering the occupied Palestinian territories. 

<br><br>On November 9, 2000: <br>
The Israeli occupation forces shot at French journalist Robers 
Laubrant, a correspondent of Associated Press, wounding him with a 
live bullet in the thigh. He was evacuated to hospital. This 
incident took place while Laubrant was covering clashes between 
Palestinian civilians and the Israeli occupation forces near Al-Tuffah 
roadblock, between Khan Yunis city and Al-Mawasi (agricultural) area, 
under the control of the Israeli occupation forces. 

<br><br> On November 11, 2000: 
<br>The Israeli occupation forces shot at American journalist Jaula 
Monakov, 37 years old, a correspondent of the Associated Press, 
wounding her with two live bullets in the pelvis and the bladder. 
This incident took place while she was covering clashes between 
Palestinian civilians and the Israeli occupation forces in the 
vicinity of Bilal Ben Rabah mosque in Bethlehem. 

<br><br>On the same day, the car of journalist Marwan El-Ghoul was shot at for 
the second time by the Israeli occupation forces. This incident took 
place while El-Ghoul was covering the burning of a civilian car in 
which two Palestinian civilians were shot dead by the Israeli 
occupation forces near Al-Matahen junction in Al-Qarara. In his 
testimony to PCHR, El-Ghoul stated that he immediately went to the 
area when he learned about the shooting at a civilian car by the 
Israeli occupation forces. He saw Israeli occupation troops using a 
robot to inhumanely pull the bodies of two Palestinian civilians from 
the car. He added that Palestinian citizens in the area started to 
shout “Allah Akbar” (Allah is the greatest) as soon as they saw the 
inhumane way in which the Israeli occupation forces were dealing with 
the bodies of the Palestinian martyrs. Immediately, the Israeli 
occupation forces shot at Palestinian citizens, wounding a number of 
them seriously. At that time, El-Ghouls says he tried to reach his car 
to leave the area. He was about two meters away from his car when it 
was shot at intensively. As a result it was severely damaged. 

</p><p>On the same day, Samir Khalifa, a correspondent of the Palestinian 
Television, and a staff of accompanying cameramen were evacuated to 
Shifa’ hospital in Gaza, due to inhaling tear gas used by the Israeli 
occupation forces in the area where the above-mentioned Palestinian 
civilians were shot dead. Khalifa and the staff were trapped under 
fire opened up by the Israeli occupation forces. 

</p><p>On November 16, 2000: <br>
Israeli occupation troops positioned in the vicinity of City Inn in 
Ramallah shot at Mohammed Zeid El-Kielani, a cameraman of Arab News 
Network (ANN), wounding him with a rubber-coated metal bullet in the 
shoulder. This incident took place while El-Kielani was covering 
clashes between Palestinian civilians and the Israeli occupation 
forces at the entrance of Al-Bireh. 

</p><p>On November 19, 2000:<br> 
Mouaffaq Turki Qassem Mattar, 46 years old, a photographer of 
Falasteen Al-Yawm (Palestine Today) Press in Ramallah, was wounded 
again, with a rubber-coated bullet in the head. This incident took 
place while Mattar was covering clashes in Al-Mentar area to the east 
of Gaza City, during which the Israeli occupation forces shot dead a 
14-year-old Palestinian child and wounded 23 Palestinian civilians, 
including Mattar himself. 

</p><p>PCHR condemns such practices by the Israeli occupation forces against 
local and international journalists. PCHR considers these belligerent 
actions to be a part of the racist practices of the Israeli occupation 
forces. PCHR stresses the following: 

</p><p>The basic duty of journalists is to convey facts honestly, 
objectively and without bias to any party. Achieving this requires 
the freedom to receive and impart information, without any 
restrictions that may hinder journalists from carrying out their duty. 

</p><p>Practices of the Israeli occupation forces against journalists of 
local and international press agencies are part and parcel of the 
practices of these forces against defenseless Palestinian civilians. 
The practices have caused the deaths of more than 210 Palestinians, 
while wounding thousands more. 

</p><p>In light of the above, PCHR stresses that practices of the Israeli 
occupation forces against local and international journalists aim at 
terrifying them, so that they will stop imparting information and 
photos of the crimes committed by these forces against defenseless 
Palestinian civilians. They aim at imposing media isolation on the 
occupied Palestinian territories in order to pave the way for the 
Israeli occupation forces to commit more crimes against defenseless 
Palestinian civilians. These crimes would be carried out away from the 
eyes of the world and without journalists being able to document them. 

</p><p>Through these practices, the Israeli occupation forces seek to 
prevent journalists from documenting their crimes against defenseless 
Palestinian civilians in order to avoid being condemned by the 
international community and public opinion. 

</p><p>PCHR is concerned about such practices because of the serious 
possibility that the Israeli occupation forces might escalate their 
crimes against defenseless Palestinian civilians in the occupied 
Palestinian territories. In this context, PCHR reminds the 
international community of the practices of the Israeli occupation 
forces in 1982, when these forces isolated the refugee camps of Sabra 
and Shatila and oversaw a ruthless massacre of the Palestinian people; 
killing in cold blood and with collaboration from the Lebanese 
Al-Kataeb more than 3,000 defenseless Palestinian civilians in the two 
refugee camps. 

</p><p>In light of the above, PCHR calls on the international community, 
especially the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva 
Convention, to immediately intervene to implement UN Security Council 
Resolution 1322/2000, which calls for establishing an international 
commission of inquiry to investigate the crimes being committed by the 
Israeli occupation forces against defenseless Palestinian civilians in 
the occupied Palestinian territories. 

</p><p>PCHR calls on the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva 
Convention to meet their obligations under the Convention and 
immediately provide international protection for the Palestinian 
people in order to prevent crimes that could be committed by the 
Israeli occupation forces against defenseless Palestinian civilians. </p><p align="right"><a href="/addameer.org/september2000/reports/#top" style="">return to top</a>
