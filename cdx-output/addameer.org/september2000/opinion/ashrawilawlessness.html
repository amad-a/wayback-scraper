</font></p><h3><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Lawlessness and the Rule of Law</font></h3><font face="Verdana" size="2">
<p> Dr. Hanan Ashrawi
</p><p> January 19
 



</p><p>With the ongoing crisis in the peace process and with Palestinian-

Israeli relations degenerating to the worst brutality of the occupier-

occupied equation, the last thing we need as Palestinians is 
internal

disintegration.



</p><p>
It is imperative that Israel's policies and measures of

lawlessness, 

including its imposition of a state of multiple siege, its shelling of

homes and indiscriminate shooting of civilians, and its systematic

assassination (extra-judicial killings) of field and political

leaderships not be internalized to become justifications for internal

distortions and violations.



</p><p>
More than ever now there is a pressing need to address issues of

public order, collective responsibility, and societal cohesiveness as

well as "normal" institutional behavior within Palestinian realities.


</p><p>

The most fundamental requirement for sustaining the very fabric of

life in Palestine is the enactment of the principle of the rule of

law, particularly in reforming and revitalizing an independent

judicial system and in ensuring due process in all cases.




</p><p>From the mundane (such as compliance with traffic regulations),

through issues of personal property and safety, to the most volatile

question of treason and collaboration with Israel猶alestine and its

leadership are called upon to demonstrate a sense of responsibility,

restraint, self-discipline, respect for the law, and public service.



</p><p>
The Legislative Council (despite the dubiousness of its extended

mandate) must ensure effective and speedy legislation to respond to

(as well as to anticipate) the urgent emergency needs of a population

already traumatized by a massive Israeli military assault and

strangulation.


</p><p>

The different public institutions and governmental bodies are called

upon to intensify and upgrade their work to alleviate suffering and

deprivation and to protect the interests and well being of the

citizenry.


</p><p>

The judiciary, despite the multiple closure and lack of freedom of

movement, must act expeditiously to perform its functions and ensure a

genuine rule of law and due process.


</p><p>

The security forces are called upon to undertake their

responsibilities as law enforcement agencies, maintaining discipline

and compliance with the law.


</p><p>

MIFTAH has repeatedly called for the completion and upgrading of the

judiciary and the legal system, for the abolition of the military

State Security Courts and the abandonment of the death penalty, for

the establishment of transparent and accountable public institutions

based on professionalism and meritocracy, and for the enhancement of

democratic practices and respect for pluralism by establishing an

integrated and inclusive system of participatory governance (See, for

example, Key Issues: Violence and Retribution in Palestine,

Developments in the Palestinian Judiciary, Justice and the Palestinian

Judiciary).



</p><p>
It should come as no surprise that the absence of legal

accountability would lead to excesses (with impunity) on the one

hand, and to a degeneration into tribal, community, revolutionary,

popular, and even personal "justice" on the other hand.


</p><p>

In an attempt to protect itself from the inherent threat of such

crimes as collaboration (leading to the Israeli assassination of

national leaders) and in an attempt to punish the guilty, Palestinian

society has accepted (and in some cases pressed for) the

implementation of the death penalty. Under popular pressure, the PNA

activated the "instant justice" of the state security courts.



</p><p>
More alarming is the resort to "lethal retribution" against

collaborators by organizations and individuals who, in the face of

real threat, take the law into their own hands.


</p><p>

Despite the horror of the offense itself and its fatal consequences on

Palestinian security and well-being, countering Israel's illegal and

immoral recruitment and activation of collaborators to carry out its

policy of political assassinations should not take the form of

parallel "eliminations."




Nor should suspicion (or even proof) of corruption or abuse and

misuse of public position and funds be cause for violent, extra

judicial punishment.


</p><p>

Even during the first Intifada, Palestinians called for "Days of

Repentance" for collaborators in a process of political

rehabilitation and redemption. The acceptable penalty was one

of "ostracism" from society or community.


</p><p>

Although such measures did not always succeed, at least there was

awareness that popular revenge, settling of scores, or extra judicial

"justice" would lead to an internal unraveling of the social fabric.



</p><p>
With the presence of the PNA and its different institutions, this has

become even more urgent and compelling. The PNA must put its own house

in order and must ensure that all branches of government are

functioning effectively.



</p><p>
No one can overestimate the disruptive and destructive impact of the

current crisis and of Israel's brutality as a belligerent occupant; to

withstand such assaults, however, it is imperative that the structures

and systems of democratic life be maintained as the most constructive

and efficient form of empowerment of the victims to enable them to

withstand such an external assault.



</p><p>
Equality before the law, due process, and the presumption of

innocence must all be maintained. Hence all violators must have their

day and say in a properly constituted court. It is not a question of

image, or of responding to donor or external pressure (as the minister

of justice claimed).


</p><p>

Rather, it is the appropriate responsibility of any government to

ensure justice and legal accountability as well as institutional

service and protection of its citizenry.



</p><p>
It is also the appropriate right of the people to expect and to

receive fair and effective governance.



</p><p>
Once again, internal empowerment and stability are the only means for

withstanding external threat and repression.
