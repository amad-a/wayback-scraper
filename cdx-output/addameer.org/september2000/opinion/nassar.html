</p><h3>Letter from Dr. Majed Nassar</h3>
<p> 
Union of Health Work Committees<br>
Palestine





</p><p>Today, a US non-governmental organization (Agency for Relief and
Development in Conflict Regions) wrote to me, that I should stop
sending them my messages.  They said that "for those of us who
have
worked in a number of extremely violent and poor conflict situations,
your writings seem excessive."

</p><p>I have no idea where these people live. May be in Tel Aviv or even in
Jerusalem where they can drink a glass of beer or a cup of coffee
in a
street cafe, on a beautiful, autumn evening, and talk about their
experience in the "extremely violent and poor conflict regions."  I
would like to invite them for the same cup of coffee and a cooler
glass of beer, only few kilometers away from their peaceful
surroundings.  I would like to invite them to Beit Sahour or Beit
Jala.  Or even to Gaza.  They can come to Beit Sahour and stay in
one
of the houses at the front line.  They can try to sleep during the
shelling.  They can try to calm the children down while they are
screaming. They can try to console the families for their losses.
They can try to help us attend the wounded.  And they can try to stand
by us when we declare someone dead. How much violence do these people
need? How much violence do they need to stand up to the name of the
organization they are working for?

</p><p>Last night the combat helicopters and the Israeli tanks shelled Beit
Sahour for several hours.  No one was killed.  "Only" homes were
destroyed.  No one was wounded.  The Israelis use the argument
"someone shot at the Israeli camp to the east of Beit Sahour." But
today?

</p><p>Usually the shelling starts in the evening hours.  During the day, the
families who left their bombed homes weeks ago come to see the damage
that the previous night's bombing inflicted upon them.  Today, a
sunny, warm, autumn morning, two Palestinian officers also came to see
the damage.  Two rockets were fired from a combat helicopter, hit the
car of the officers, and killed one of them immediately. Another
officer was seriously wounded. In addition, two women from the
neighborhood who were by chance near the car, were killed -- a
52-year-old woman and her niece, both relatives of a colleague of mine
at the clinic in Beit Sahour.  They were not fighting. They were not
shooting.  They were not demonstrating.  They were not shouting.  In
fact, they were crying, after having visited the destroyed home.   Any
one of us could have been there.

</p><p>It took me only five minutes to write this letter and I will continue
encouraging everyone to write and talk and scream till the "gentle
men" from the US NGO who were "working in extremely violent and poor
conflict regions," and others like them, start to listen.
