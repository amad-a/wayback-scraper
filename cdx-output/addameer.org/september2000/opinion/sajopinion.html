</p><h3>The Intifada's military lessons</h3>



<p> Published October 25, 2000 at http://www.jmcc.org/media/reportonline<br>

by the Palestine Report




</p><p>Special Report by Saleh Abdel Jawad, head of the Department of 
Political
Science at Birzeit University.

</p><p>WHAT ARE the crucial lessons to be learned from the recent 
confrontations?
The emotive aspect of the Intifada and the jargon of heroism and 
sacrifice
have been efficiently covered in the Palestinian press, but this 
article is
the other - and no less important - half of the picture.


</p><p>Heroism and strategic shortcomings<br>

In spite of their unprecedented heroism and sacrifices, the current
confrontations have proven that the Palestinian side (the Palestinian
Authority, its opposition and society in general) is not prepared for a
military face-off. This is due not only to the enormous gap in 
capabilities
between the two sides, but also to our lack of preparedness. This is so
despite all previous statements by the Palestinian leadership - 
political
and military - on preparations for possible confrontation imposed by 
the
occupier in case of a declaration of statehood or a failure to adhere 
to its
desired settlement.

</p><p>On October 8, I visited a Palestinian military outpost at one entrance 
to
Ramallah. There were only five people at the outpost. More importantly, 
the
outpost showed no signs of trenches, fortifications or even one 
sandbag.

</p><p>More examples are not necessary, as the shortcomings are clear. A talk 
with
any given officer or member of the national security forces leads one 
to a
similar conclusion. This points to the political decision-maker's lack 
of
seriousness and knowledge of his foe. It also explains Israel's 
indifference
to the Palestinian side and its perception that any disturbance will 
only be
a passing outburst of rage. Israeli preparations, on the other hand, 
have
proven to be under development since the tunnel incidents of 1996.

</p><p>In addition to a gap in capabilities, shortcomings in preparation have
manifested several spontaneous and erroneous tactics on the ground. The
events have somersaulted into a strategic method that can only lead to
disaster.

</p><p>The participation of "armed" Palestinian elements in popular 
demonstrations
and shootings at soldiers and settlers must end, even though we know 
that it
occurs within a context of self- defense. These shootings take place 
from a
distance, and frankly speaking, are fruitless. While these people do 
not
lack faith or the willingness to sacrifice, they do suffer from a lack 
of
appropriate weapons, a shortage of ammunition and more importantly, a 
severe
lack of experience, training and knowledge. They also lack discipline 
and a
central leadership.

</p><p>The participation of these elements are nothing more than symbolic, 
giving a
false sense of safety and security. Instead, they offer Israel the 
excuse to
use tanks, Cobra helicopters and rockets to quell an uprising that is
popular in essence. For the first time since 1967, the enemy has had 
reason
to shell and destroy neighborhoods. If this situation intensifies, it 
will
also allow the temporary or permanent expulsion of people from their
neighborhoods, villages or even cities, creating a Palestinian 
strategic
threat.

</p><p>I suggest that there be extensive national debate over this issue. 
Perhaps
in anticipation of this moment, a blind eye has been turned to the 
weapons
that have trickled over the past few years from the Israeli market into 
the
hands of these elements. But this tactic has proven its ultimate 
failure,
causing unjustified losses in the ranks of both those armed and those
demonstrating.

</p><p>That some say that the evacuation of Joseph's Tomb in Nablus is 
evidence of
this tactic's success shows an inability to extract lessons and 
standards
from our experience. We cannot apply this site's particular 
circumstances to
the remaining military outposts and settlements. This tiny location, 
planted
in the midst of a large Palestinian population, was guarded by only 13
Israeli soldiers who were able to hold their position for over 10 days
despite dozens of attacks. During those attacks, one Israel died in 
exchange
for the deaths of seven Palestinians and the injury of at least 75.

</p><p>I believe that if this site had not sat in the middle of a residential 
area,
Israel would not have evacuated it. Therefore, attacking fortified 
Israeli
military outposts or settlements surrounded by empty areas does nothing 
(as
we have seen in different confrontations) but result in tremendous
Palestinian human loss, not to mention strategic harm. If we are to 
learn
anything from the 1948 War, it is that attacks on well-fortified 
Israeli
positions only lead, except in rare cases, to losses on the Palestinian 
and
Arab side. In those days, the gap in capabilities was not nearly as 
broad as
it is today.

</p><p>In the long run, attacks on settlements and fortified outposts 
exhausted the
Arab forces and broke them. History has shown that when the Palestinian 
side
did not launch these attacks, the Jewish fighters or Hagana did, using
special agents or local collaborators. And when they could not find
collaborators, they sent settlers to open fire to provoke public 
opinion in
those settlements that had good relations with their Arab neighbors,
creating a sense of responsibility among the Arab population. This, in 
the
end, served to facilitate the expulsion of Arab villages (One must only
examine the confession of Iyal Ofek of Kibbutz Hazori on the expulsion 
of
the residents of Qira and Abu Zreiq villages in the Haifa area to see 
that
this holds true).

</p><p>Currently, it is sufficient to point to the losses on both sides to 
prove
these tactics fruitless. While the Palestinians lost over 80 martyrs 
during
the tunnel confrontations in exchange for 16 Israeli soldiers (a ratio 
of 1
to 5) the Palestinians have lost 80 martyrs to two Israeli solders (a 
ratio
of 1 to 40) in the current confrontations. It is my belief that the gap 
in
this ratio will only get wider if we fall into the trap of a total 
armed
confrontation, one where the Israelis will be the initiators and we are 
on
the defensive.

</p><p>It is understandable that young men publicly carry arms as a 
recognizable
symbol of a brave resistance for a people subject to the ugliest kinds 
of
oppression. In our present circumstance, however, this hands Israel the
excuse for crushing this resistance on a silver platter.

</p><p>The use of arms in popular confrontations is political and military 
suicide.
Therefore it must be separated from the popular dimension of the 
struggle
and action should be taken towards stripping the enemy, as was the case 
in
the Intifada, of its overwhelming military superiority. This does not 
have
to mean a return to the Intifada and all of its specifics, but that we 
learn
from its strengths such as popular committees, popular and societal 
forms of
struggle, social solidarity, economic boycotting and an emphasis on 
public
opinion. We must also develop a new discourse that includes studied 
military
action.

</p><p>The school of thought that advocates a total military confrontation or 
armed
popular struggle against the occupation is fraught with danger. This
thinking springs from the desire to defend the people, but it falls 
directly
into the trap that Israel has planned since the tunnel incidents. The 
trap
will become more dangerous and plausible in light of talk of an 
emergency
national unity government including Likud leader Ariel Sharon.


</p><p>The Israeli strategy

<br>The creation of a Palestinian strategy to confront Israeli tactics 
requires
us to first understand their planning, and then to try and frustrate 
it. The
Israeli strategy, developed since the tunnel incident and amended 
slightly
to confront a unilateral declaration of statehood, has three levels:
political-diplomatic, socioeconomic and finally, military.

</p><p>Israel's political strategy is divided into two parts. The first is 
internal
and focuses on uniting Israel's political street behind its leadership 
and
transforming the conflict into an ethno-religious conflict. It gives 
the
illusion of total war that puts to use all the society's resources 
because
the fight against the Palestinians is a declaration of war on the 
existence
of the state of Israel. The revolution of Palestinians inside the Green 
Line
will be used as evidence of this. Hence, Barak will call on the 
majority to
form a national unity government.

The second part is external and is aimed at winning the battle for
international public opinion, particularly that of Americans and 
Europeans,
by portraying Palestinians as the aggressor.

</p><p>The economic level of the plan aims to weaken Palestinians financially 
and
exhaust their societal structure. The idea of weakening the 
Palestinians by
waging an economic war is not new; it was hatched and implemented 
during the
Intifada. Researcher Arieh Shalev from the Jaffe Center for Strategic
Studies at Tel Aviv University, a general reservist and a Labor Party
supporter, as well as military governor in the West Bank in the early
seventies, proposed a number of economic weapons, the most important 
being
imposition of long periods of curfew, perhaps extending for months on 
end;
imposition of a siege on villages and cities and the severing of
transportation between them; prohibition of Palestinian labor in 
Israel; as
well as strikes on production sectors.

</p><p>Today, we can assume that other measures will be employed born out of 
the
circumstances created by the Oslo Accords, one being the partial 
dissolution
of the Palestinian presence at international crossings, including the 
Gaza
Airport. In addition, crucial monthly financial transfers from Israel 
to the
Palestinian Authority of tax and customs revenues will be brought to a 
halt.

</p><p>Most importantly, militarily Israel wants to engage the Authority in a
decisive battle, without necessarily entering Palestinian cities (at 
least
in beginning stages). It might be more concerned with striking the
leadership's positions and major military compounds, like governates 
and so
on through "surgical bombing." This could also mean the occupation of
villages in Area B or the imposition of a siege of terror in which 
settlers
would play a major role. As the situation develops, cities may 
eventually be
reoccupied.

</p><p>The Israeli military strategy is based on lessons in combat theory 
developed
by the Americans after the Vietnam War. American militarists, namely 
Collin
Powell, developed the "hammer theory" that states that the main reason 
for
the Vietnam defeat was that American military intervention was not 
decisive
from its outset.  The use of gradual force allowed the enemies of the 
north
Vietnamese and the Viet Cong to also gradually build up strength, thus
prohibiting an American victory. Also, American involvement in direct 
combat
led to great loss in human life.

</p><p>Hence, before any military confrontation, the American military 
strategy in
its preliminary stages is to mobilize a huge military force that has 
been
readied through the gathering of intelligence information and preparing 
the
public for a confrontation.

</p><p>In practice, the enemy is then struck with one blow that disorients it 
and
disperses its forces without giving the chance for a response. It also 
does
not leave any opportunity for international intervention to end the
conflict. This strategy avoids entering into direct military 
confrontation
with the enemy, which results in huge human loss that enflames local 
public
opinion. Instead, it tries as much as possible to lessen the chances of
hitting civilians from the enemy camp, thus provoking world opinion.
Finally, this method does its best to isolate the battlefield and its
atrocities from the eyes of the public.

</p><p>The United States has applied this combat theory repeatedly with great
success in its strikes in Grenada, Panama, Iraq and Kosovo.

</p><p>The Israeli government has adopted this combat theory and partially
implemented it in Lebanon in 1994. The second time it was used was in 
1996
in Operation Grapes of Wrath. There, however, the results were less 
than
satisfactory due to the nature and tactics of the Lebanese resistance, 
which
did not allow Israel to destroy Hezballah's combat force, which differs 
from
that of conventional armies. It also failed to win the public opinion
battle, particularly in the massacre at Qana refugee camp and an 
inability
to prevent the media from reporting. The Israeli army was not able to 
fully
implement this strategy in the 1996 tunnel incidents because it was not
prepared. Now, however, we have ample reason to believe that Israel is
following this strategy in trying to trap Palestinians into 
confrontation.
It is in our interest to frustrate this Israeli plan and avoid a 
decisive
battle. -Published 25/10/00
