</p><h3>What Americans Can Do for Justice</h3>
<p>  By Samah Jabr
</p><p>11 February 2001

</p><p>
    Today is just another day in Palestine: another death; another

    outrage; another horror for the world to read about. In Iowa, I'm

    told, only those who bother to flip beyond the front page Jesse

    Jackson paternity headline, rustle past the Personalities in the

    News tidbits and 10 pages of advertisements with, at best, one

    news column per page finally reaching the International News

    section will see that yet another Palestinian has been killed.

</p><p>
    Few, I imagine will even see the report. Those who do will

    mistakenly think the now tired Israeli cliché that Palestinians

    are still sending their kids in harm's way and disrupting peace in

    an otherwise "democratic" country. If they think this or anything

    at all about the death of another Palestinian, most readers will

    then go off to experience their day. The reported episode will

    mean nothing to them.

</p><p>
    On television, I watched as the dead body of the Palestinian young

    man fro Hebron, Bilal Al-Husaeini was desiccated, dragged for

    hundreds of meters from the Hebron down town to Israel's claimed

    territory. The acts and the video made me feel threatened. The act

    was not unlike the recent dragging of an African-American

    southerner by white men. But unlike what happened in Israel, the

    men in America were punished for their reprehensible act and the

    reasons behind that murder were thoroughly denounced. Those who

    may have approved of this evil were driven by the rest of America

    to silence, relegated to the secrecy of their own immorality.

</p><p>
    I know the world saw Israeli troops murder a 12-year old boy in

    Gaza who died in his father's arms amid a fury of gunfire. Anyone,

    anywhere, who allowed him or herself to see, could be witness to

    the uneven battle Palestinians face and the hatred leveled against

    us.

</p><p>
    Today, eight hours ahead of my Iowa family, I sip my morning

    coffee and wonder if they will see the story about the newest

    killing in Palestine when they get up and start their day with

    their newspaper and a cup of coffee. Will it matter if they do see

    the story? I wonder how many Iowans will care who killed whom or

    why? I wonder how many Americans know that their taxes financed

    the Israeli atrocities which force us to fight the only way we

    can, with "terrorism", as Westerners call it. I wonder if the

    people I met at Chautauqua, New York understand the pressures of

    war and the wish for survival creates burdens that sometimes

    destroy morality, faith, and our own allegiance to each other. I

    wonder if they will recognize that our only weapon against

    oppression is to stand up to tanks and nighttime attacks against

    our villages and to die before the world's eyes, hoping against

    hope that someone will see that we have arms and legs and faces

    and hands like any other humans. I know there are people in

    America who care and who do not want their tax dollars to finance

    our misery, but will they have the courage to speak about our

    reality to an audience who cares no more about us than they do

    about a television commercial? In a sense, our plight is action

    against the peddling of Zionism and Jewish denial of what the

    state of Israel has done to us.

</p><p>
    "The other night," an American friend wrote, "a group of us were

    discussing worldwide violence as we sat waiting for our dinner in

    a local restaurant. One woman looked up and said, "As long as

    there are Palestinians, there will be war."

</p><p>
    All the other women at the table stopped short and were silent,

    but no one wanted to disrupt the social evening by challenging the

    remark. No one even had the courage to say, "As long as there is

    injustice, there will be war."

</p><p>
    Speaking to a service group, another friend trying to explain why

    Palestinians continue to stand up to aggression that has taken all

    but approximately 16 percent of their country from them, was

    constantly interrupted by queries such as "What's an Arab?" and

    "Are Christians Arabs?" and "Are Palestinians a people?'" The talk

    was about Palestinian refugees, the largest group of displaced

    persons in the world today, estimated at somewhere between 4 to 6

    million people. Yet, in Mid-west America, some listeners couldn't

    even fathom the existence of Palestinians let alone the realities

    of their struggle. Even Arabs and Muslims seemed to lie beyond

    definition, somewhere, I suppose, out there in Hollywood violence

    or in a cultural abyss.

</p><p>
    If Americans are faithful to their moral traditions, peace,

    justice and the democracy that they want to export to the whole

    world, then Americans cannot turn away refusing to be "their

    brother's keeper", even if that brother or sister is an Arab

    Palestinian. If they truly believe in human rights for all, then

    they will write letters to their local and national

    representatives in government, demanding an end to support the

    Israeli government. And when the sit down to reconcile their

    federal tax returns, they will demand an end to the use of US tax

    dollars being spent to perpetuate these injustices.


    </p><p>My hopes are in the hands of those who know the meaning of justice

    and who have lived in a land where cooperation and peace make

    possible all the potential of our day. I stretch my hand to those

    of you who care with the prayer that morality will unite us

    allowing injustice to fade as people of all faiths return to what

    is holy within them. Then, the faded kingdoms of our past will be

    the parables they are meant to be.
