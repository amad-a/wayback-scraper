</p><h3>The Barak Government's Murky "White Paper"<br>
Disinformation, Deception, and Degradation</h3>
<p> 
Dr. Hanan Ashrawi<br>
Palestine



</p><p>
 </p><p> On Nov. 20, 2000 the Israeli Government's public affairs
coordinator,
 Nahman Shai, released the most venomous and vicious diatribe
against
 the Palestinian Authority and the PLO with a plethora of
accusations
 ranging from non-compliance and incitement to corruption and
outright
 criminal activities.

 </p><p> While this is neither the time nor place to respond to every specific
 allegation and disinformation contained in the paper, one cannot
but
 address the concept itself and the attitude that gave rise to such
an
 inflammatory exercise.

 </p><p> If one were to take such propaganda seriously, the inevitable
 conclusion would be the total indictment of a hopelessly sullied and
 guilty Palestinian leadership, and a full exoneration of an innocent
 and pure Israeli government.

 </p><p>The question then becomes-what is innocent, hapless, and helpless
little Israel doing by engaging such a sullied, treacherous, and
despicable counterpart?

 </p><p> It behooves all people of conscience, it follows, to intervene
 immediately and rescue vulnerable Israel from the horror of having to
 besiege, starve, bomb, shell, shoot (take your pick) Palestinians to
 obliteration.

 </p><p>Such unabashed distortions and mud slinging may be viewed by some as
legitimate tools in a "propaganda war." The degradation of the
discourse and its distance from reality are nevertheless astounding.

 </p><p> The only real conclusion that emerges from reading this murkiest of
 "white" papers is indeed an alarming one:

 </p><p> Rather than carrying out a critical self-assessment and an honest
 evaluation of facts, Israel is deliberately engaging in a policy of
 deception, evasion, and engineered smear campaigns.

 </p><p> It may succeed temporarily in "feeding" its spin machines
 (particularly in the West) with talking points and convoluted
 arguments to spew forth more Palestine bashing blither.

 </p><p> The most sinister aspect, however, remains in Israel's capacity at
 self-deception.

 </p><p> If such willful blindness is pursued as a matter of policy, its main
 victims will be the Israeli public led astray by such a
 self-indulgent exercise in ostrich politics and fabricated realities.

 </p><p> Israeli public opinion is endangered by such a cynical manipulation
 of fear through the persistent demonization of the Palestinians and
 the totally unbelievable exoneration of the Israeli government (hence
 total evasion of responsibility).

 </p><p> Such a flagrant attempt at legitimizing racism and blaming the victim
 will only lead to the further distortion and erosion of the
 collective Israeli moral fiber that have emerged as a result of
 decades of unaccountable Israeli occupation and enslavement of the
 Palestinian people.

 </p><p> Consequently, the people of Israel will lose their grip on reality
 and on the handles necessary to deal with the precarious conditions
 that their own government has imposed on them.

 </p><p> By manufacturing hatred and dehumanizing the "other," the Israeli
 government is willfully perpetuating conflict and hostility.

 </p><p> Rather than looking within and trying to rectify its own mistakes and
 erroneous assumptions, the Israeli government is creating a
 smokescreen to obliterate evidence of its own guilt and culpability.

 </p><p> Along with its massive assault against the captive Palestinian people
 under Israeli occupation, and concomitant with its policy of
 strangulation, assassination, and collective victimization, Israel
 has now added the rhetoric of eradication.

 </p><p> On the one hand, it seeks to whitewash its own blood-soaked record,
 while on the other hand it obliterates the genuine reality of its
 Palestinian victims.

 </p><p> By negating their counterparts and "delegitimizing" their erstwhile
 peace partners, Israeli public officials may find themselves without
 future interlocutors.

 </p><p> They (and the prospects of a just peace) may find themselves the
 first victims of such destructive politics and rhetoric.

 </p><p> Frantically trying to locate scapegoats may be convenient in the
 short term as "cheap-shot" politics.

 </p><p> In the long term, only moral and responsible politics can, not only
 solve this current tragedy, but also produce genuine peace.

 </p><p>In this case, negating the other is the shortest way to
 self-negation.
