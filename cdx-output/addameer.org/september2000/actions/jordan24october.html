<h2>
Hundreds Injured in Jordanian Rally </h2>







<p>

(The Associated Press, Tue 24 Oct 2000)
</p><p>
SOUTH SHUNA, Jordan (AP) — Under heavy rain, thousands of Jordanians
marched toward the main Israeli-controlled border crossing Tuesday, 
then
clashed with Jordanian police in fighting that injured more than 100 
people
and broke up the attempt to cross the frontier. More than 10,000 people
from Jordan's 13 opposition parties participated in the ``March of 
Return''
along with legislators, political activists and trade unionists. 

</p><p>They first staged a sit-in at the Martyrs Monument of Karameh, site of 
a
1968 battle between Arab guerrillas and Israeli forces. ``The protest 
march
is aimed at highlighting and insisting on the right of return of
Palestinian refugees and Arab and Muslim rights in Jerusalem,'' said 
Saleh
Armouti, one of the organizers and the president of the Jordan Bar
Association. In peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, which 
are
now suspended, refugees and Jerusalem are two of the most difficult 
issues. 

</p><p>Palestinians want the eastern part of the holy city to be the capital 
of
their future state and also demand that hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians in Jordan and elsewhere be allowed to return to what is 
now
Israel. Israel says it will not recognize the right of return but will
allow some refugees to settle in Israel for humanitarian reasons. It is
willing to relinquish some of the outlying Arab neighborhoods but not 
the
entire eastern sector of Jerusalem. The demonstrators, carrying banners
that read ``Yes to cutting ties with the Zionist enemy'' and ``Yes to 
the
right of return,'' called on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to strike
against Israel as he did during the 1991 Gulf War. 

</p><p>The demonstrators headed toward the Allenby Bridge over the Jordan 
River,
which separates the kingdom from the West Bank. As helicopters hovered
overhead, police using water cannon and tear gas clashed with them some 
2
1/2 miles east of the bridge. Police also fired into the air and beat
rock-throwing protesters with clubs. Hospital officials said they 
treated
15 policemen and 120 demonstrators. 

</p><p>A similar march in 1989 also left scores injured. On Tuesday, the 
22-mile
road from Amman to the border was filled with Jordanian armored 
personnel
carriers, and security forces kept many people from reaching the
demonstration. During the past three weeks, Arab demonstrators across 
the
region have condemned Israel for clashes between its security forces 
and
Palestinians that have killed more than 120 people, most of them
Palestinians.
