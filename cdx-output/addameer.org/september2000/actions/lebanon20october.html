<h2>
    Palestinian protestors burn U.N. flag for 1st time </h2>

By Abdel Mawla Khaled (UPI 20 October 2000) 

</p><p>EIN el-HELWEH, Lebanon, Oct. 20 (UPI) -- Palestinian refugees 
protesting
inside a refugee camp in south Lebanon against what they describe as
Israeli aggressions against the Palestinian territories burned a U.N. 
flag
for the first time Friday. Some 100 protestors, including women and
children, staged a sit-in in the Ein el-Helweh shantytown on the 
outskirts
of the port city of Sidon in southern Lebanon to protest the emergency
Mideast summit at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh and at 
the
Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians in the West Bank and Gaza. 

</p><p>The demonstrators trampled on a U.N. flag before setting it ablaze to
denounce what they described as the United Nation's failure to stop
Israel's "massacre" of the Palestinian people. In the past three weeks 
more
than 100 people have been killed in violence between Palestinian 
protesters
and Israeli troops; a vast majority of those killed were Palestinian. 
It
was the first time that Palestinians vented their anger against the 
United
Nations since Israel was created in 1948. The protestors also burned 
U.S.
and Israeli flags and raised placards pledging to free Palestine and 
the
holy city of Jerusalem, which both they and the Israelis claim as their
eternal, undivided capital. 

</p><p>Sultan Abul Aynain, the Palestine Liberation Organization 
representative in
Lebanon, told United Press International that the demonstrators set 
fire to
the U.N. flag as "an expression of their anger and to protest the 
U.N.'s
failure to pressure Israel into stopping its massacres against the
Palestinians." Timor Goskel, the U.N. spokesman in south Lebanon, said 
he
regretted the incident and said the United Nations was greatly 
concerned by
the burning of its flags by Palestinian protestors. 

</p><p>The Palestinians later released a statement that said continued 
protests
"proved that the Zionist peace process had failed." The statement 
accused
the Yasser Arafat's Palestinian authority of "weakness" for its 
apparent
failure to prevent "the continued massacre by the Zionist enemy." There 
are
some 350,000 Palestinians who have lived in Lebanon, mostly in refugee
camps, since Israel was created in 1948.
