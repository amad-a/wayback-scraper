<h2>
  Million took to the street in support of Palestinians</h2>







<p>
(BERNAMA-IINA, 24 October 2000)

</p><p>SANA'A, Oct 24 (Bernama-IINA) -- A huge procession in which at least a
million people took part was held here, to show solidarity with their
Palestinian brothers and sisters in their defiance of Israeli 
occupation
and their struggle for Jerusalem. The demonstrators repeatedly chanted 
the
slogans that there should be no normalization of relations with Israel, 
no
peace with Israel, and the rallying call that said: "Khaybar, Khaybar 
will
be repeated." </p><p>The demonstrators assembled in the Sabeen Square, north 
of
the capital,where the Speaker of the Yemeni National Assembly, Sheikh
Abdullah Al-Ahmar, addressed them, and called for the opening of the
borders with Israeli so that people could volunteer to fight the 
Zionists.
He called for help for the Intifadha, and urged the people to help the
Palestinians in everyway possible, including money and weapons. 

</p><p>The demonstrators then headed for the UN offices in Sana'a, where the
Speaker of the National Assembly handed in a memorandum outlining the
Israeli entity's human rights violations and repression of the 
Palestinian
people, which, said the memorandum, has already killed 120 Palestinians 
and
injured more than 4,000 of them. The memorandum went on to state that 
the
massacres that are perpetrated by the Israelis are a slap in the face 
of
Arab and Islamic systems, and even the international community, which 
has
done nothing to stop the Zionist misdeeds against the unarmed 
Palestinians
and against the religious holy sites of the Muslims, and the violations 
of
the human rights of the Palestinians. 

</p><p>The memorandum then called upon all the leaders of Arab countries to
support and help the Palestinian Intifadha in every possible way, 
including
moral, material and military support, and also to decide on what is to 
be
done to ensure the setting up of an independent Palestinian state, with
Jerusalem as its capital. The memorandum said that the Arab leaders 
must do
everything to protect the Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, and to cancel all 
kind
of normalization with the Zionist entity, which, it said should be
boycotted completely. The memorandum requested Arab and Muslim 
countries to
reconsider their relations with other countries, bearing in mind their
stances toward the Palestine issue, and to set up a fund for helping 
the
Palestinian people. -- Bernama-IINA
