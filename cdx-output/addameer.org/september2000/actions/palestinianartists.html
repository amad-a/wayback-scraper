</p><h3>Appeal from the Palestinian Society of Artists</h3>





<p>The following appeal was sent from the Palestinian Society of Artists. You can contact them at <a href="mailto:p-
art@p-ol.com" style="pointer-events: none;">p-
art@p-ol.com</a>

</p><p>To the artists of the world,

</p><p>We present you with a collection of photos of martyrs for freedom
in Palestine at this critical stage.  Martyred for the cause of life 
and
liberty.

</p><p>These martyrs had dreams, memories and a future, but one Israeli
bullet was powerful enough to destroy them all in a single,
devastating instant.  These martyrs are the faces of the Palestinian
struggle, the struggle for freedom, dignity and human rights.

</p><p>We call on the world’s artisan community to enshrine these
freedom fighters in our memories. We ask that each artist take a
martyr’s picture and create a piece of art with it. We hope to
collect these works of art and present them in an exhibition in
Palestine.

</p><p>If you would like to take on this project, please choose one
martyr’s picture from those available and contact us at e-mail <a href="mailto:p-art@p-ol.com" style="pointer-events: none;">p-
art@p-ol.com</a>

</p><p>We are striving to create a museum of Palestinian memory and
would like you to help. The deadline to contact us is November 25,
2000.


</p><p>To the children of the world,

</p><p>Palestinian children have been the recent targets of the Israeli
military.  Everyday, Palestine loses a child and with him, she loses
his dreams, his memories and the entire universe that he
encapsulated. These Palestinian children call out to the world’s
children to ensure that they are never forgotten, to ensure that they
are forever embedded in the world’s memory.

</p><p>Children, everyday you witness the ongoing Palestinian tragedy.
Everyday you witness the ongoing tragedy that Palestinian children
endure and the formidable threat to their lives and their future.

</p><p>If you would like to take part in this effort, please create a
picture/drawing in memory of these Palestinian children and send
them to p-art@p-ol.com.
