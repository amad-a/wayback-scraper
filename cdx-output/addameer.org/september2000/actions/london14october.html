<h2>  
Protest at Israeli Embassy in London </h2>









<p> 
   
(The Times, 14 October 2000)

</p><p> More than 200 protesters gathered outside the Israeli Embassy in 
Britain on
Saturday to voice their anger against the continued killing of 
Palestinians
in the Middle East.

</p><p> They included a mixture of Palestinian refugees, British students, and
other members of the public.

</p><p> Their message centred around the killing of Mohammed Dura, 12, who was 
shot
dead by an Israeli sniper earlier this month. Millions of television
viewers around the world saw film of him and his father Jamal 
attempting to
shelter from gunfire after becoming caught up in a gunbattle between
Palestinians and Israeli soldiers.

</p><p> Despite 45 minutes cowering behind a small wall with the father 
screaming
"the child, the child" to the Israeli soldiers, both were then shot - 
the
boy fatally. An ambulance driver who attempted to save them was also 
killed.

</p><p> The protesters gathered in London today held aloft a giant banner 
carrying
photographs from the film of his killing. It also bore the slogans: "A
Child's Terrifying Last Moment," and "Israeli State Sponsored 
Massacres."

</p><p> A small but significant police presence reminded the gathering to 
maintain
a peaceful protest as around a dozen officers stood guard outside the
Embassy in Kensington High Street, London.

</p><p> The protesters, made up of all ages and different nationalities, 
insisted
they would maintain a peaceful protest as they shouted chants against 
the
Israeli security forces. A significant presence of Socialist Worker 
members
was also in attendance, handing out banners bearing the slogan "Stop 
the
massacre. Free Palestine".

</p><p> The protest organiser Rabee Sahyoun, of the Palestinian Right of Return
Coalition, said his organisation had no intention of letting the
demonstration turn violent.

</p><p> "If anything starts to happen of that nature we are going to 
immediately
try to defuse it," he said. "We are co-operating heavily with the 
police
and we do not want any trouble.

</p><p> "We just want the right to peaceful protests," said Mr Sahyoun, a
Palestinian refugee studying at the London School of Economics.

</p><p> The protesters are calling for an end to the violence in Israel and
immediate end to the killings. They were also demanding an independent
inquiry into the killings of Palestinians by Israeli troops and
international protection for Palestinian citizens.

</p><p> The Palestinian Right of Return Coalition estimates that more 90
Palestinians have been killed since violence erupted earlier this 
month,
including at least 23 children.

</p><p> It also claims that 14 Palestinian citizens living in Israel have been
murdered in politically motivated attacks by government forces and 
armed
civilians.
