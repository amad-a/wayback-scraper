<h2>  
US, Israeli flags set alight at rally</h2>









<p> 
(SAPA, 15/10/2000)

</p><p> Cape Town - American and Israeli flags were set alight during a
pro-Palestine rally at the Greenpoint Stadium in Cape Town whith some
members of the crowd chanting "Death to America, Death to Israel".

</p><p> The rally on Saturday, attended by more than 1 000 people to show their
solidarity with the Palestinians, was organised by the Quds support
committee and alliance of the majority of Muslim organisations.

</p><p> The burning of the flags happened after various speakers had addressed 
the
crowd and followed late afternoon prayers.

</p><p> The majority of the crowd had left the stands and were praying on the 
lush
turf when about eight young men entered the stadium carrying the flags.

</p><p> They proceeded to the centre of the stadium and set the flags alight.

</p><p> Some of the crowd joined in and  ripped the flags to shreds, chanting
"Death to America, Death to Israel".

</p><p> Speaking at the rally, People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad)
national secretary Abidah Roberts said: "The time has come for us as 
true
believers to stand up and fight. The time has come to declare war on 
Israel".

</p><p> She said people should stand up for Palestine and all the oppressed 
people
in the world.

</p><p> "We must bring about total justice so all of mankind can live in 
peace,"
Roberts said.

</p><p> Another speaker Anwar Nagia, a community worker, said it was the duty 
to
stand up for all injustices.

</p><p> New Unity Movement spokesman Sheik Najjaar said: "You can have
sophisticated killing machines but we have the almighty Allah.

</p><p> "He is in charge of our souls not Clinton," he said to more chants of
"Death to Israel death to America".

</p><p> One of the resolutions taken at the rally was that calls be made on the
South African government to sever ties with Israel and to condemn acts 
of
murder on Palestinians.

</p><p> Shortly after the rally ended, about 200 people marched on McDonalds
fast-foods outside the stadium.

</p><p> They threw stones, damaging about 10 vehicles.

</p><p> Police spokesman Captain Andre Traut said crowd damaged the front door 
of
the restaurant. An employee was slightly injured when she was hit by 
broken
glasses in her eye.

</p><p> Traut said a docket of public violence had been opened.

</p><p> Western Cape community safety MEC Hennie Bester condemned the incident 
in
the strongest possible terms.

</p><p> He said police would act firmly against people who did not abide by the 
law.

</p><p> Bester reiterated his call for calm and peace to prevail in the 
province.
