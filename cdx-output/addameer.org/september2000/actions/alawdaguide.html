</p><h3>AL-AWDA GUIDE FOR EFFECTIVE ACTION<br>
Stop Israeli Violations of Palestinian human rights</h3>


<p><b>DEMONSTRATIONS:</b> 
</p><p>Please announce any demonstration around the world on 
<a href="/addameer.org/ym/compose?to=al-awda@egroups.com&amp;yy=28984&amp;order=down&amp;sort=date&amp;pos=1" style="pointer-events: none;">al-awda@egroups.com</a> or
send to <a href="/addameer.org/ym/compose?to=prrc@mail.com&amp;yy=28984&amp;order=down&amp;sort=date&amp;pos=1" style="pointer-events: none;">PRRC@mail.com</a> or <a href="/addameer.org/ym/compose?to=arjan@al-awda.org&amp;yy=28984&amp;order=down&amp;sort=date&amp;pos=1" style="pointer-events: none;">arjan@al-awda.org</a> to get it included on the 
</p><p>UPDATES we send out to a huge outreach. 
</p><p>Send pictures and reports (including links to audio/video files) of past demonstrations 
  to <a href="/addameer.org/ym/compose?to=hanthala@usa.net&amp;yy=28984&amp;order=down&amp;sort=date&amp;pos=1" style="pointer-events: none;">hanthala@usa.net</a> 
  (for a reports and pictures/video/audio see <a href="/hanthala.virtualave.net/" style="pointer-events: none;">http://hanthala.virtualave.net</a>). 
</p><p>For latest developments on the ground check <a href="/addameer.org/september2000" style="">http://www.addameer.org/september2000</a> 
  or its mirror at <a href="/nigelparry.com/september2000" style="pointer-events: none;">http://nigelparry.com/september2000</a> 
</p><p><b>TIPS:</b> 
</p><p>Our primary audience is the public in the cities in which these events 
are
held.  We do this by working with the Media (TV, Radio, and newspaper),
writing to politicians and making the public aware of these contacts,
protests (e.g. at  the Israeli embassies and consulates, in front of 
city
hall, the white house etc.).

</p><p>Every action aimed at altering public opinion must have a dedicated 
media
coordinator, whose job is to ensure that the activists' point of view
reaches the wider world.

</p><p>In your comments at rallies and to the press, please be cordial and 
tell the
truth.  There is no need to exaggerate as there are an abundance of
documented injustices, the human rights abuses, murders and other 
violations
taking place.

</p><p>Please stress that even if the leaders reach a cease-fire, the 
apartheid
remains, and the Palestinian people are still being oppressed and 
ethnically
cleansed. Any agreement to come out of the current diplomatic 
activities
cannot change the reality on the ground until refugees are allowed to
return, and Israel implements democracy, equal rights, and ending the
occupation.

</p><p>Have good public speakers; read the list of martyrs; include a 
two-minute
silence; don't be provocated by police or bystanders (negative media 
might
be the result); try to hold your event at times that include as much as
possible people; preferably after office hours around 5 pm; make sure 
you
have people who know the chants with megaphones.

</p><p>If you have relatives in the area who are in danger, do share their 
stories
with the media (making it more personal).

</p><p>Make sure that you have a statement including demands for civilian
protection etc and appropriate links (Addameer's site) handy for media
persons. Assign someone to pass these demands out to journalists. 
Assign
eloquent speakers as spokespersons to the press. The presence of a 
lawyer or
two at the rally will be a big plus to insure that the police do not 
try to
violate our rights and try to confine the protest.

</p><p>Make signs with short, powerful slogans. Do not write too many things 
on
them, for you will lose the effect. See list of slogans included in 
this
list. Be firm, loud, proud, but not arrogant or disruptive. Don't let 
your
protest be run by an emotional mob. Make sure that it is organized and 
under
control at all time so that your goals are achieved.

</p><p>Along with timing your rallies for optimal coverage, get in touch with 
the
media to bring about coverage.  Determine the key media contacts in 
your
area and send  press releases, (preferably by fax, followed by a 
telephone
call). For contact addresses check the major media-sites listed below. 
Ask
supporters  to call including during the demonstration to ask why the 
media
is not there.

</p><p>For a list of media contacts see: <a href="/emedia1.mediainfo.com/emedia/" style="pointer-events: none;">http://emedia1.mediainfo.com/emedia/</a>

</p><p><b>Talking points:</b> 
</p><p>The international community (US, Europe) must take up political, moral, 
and
legal obligation by the US, Europe under international law and human 
rights
conventions to condemn Israeli violations of human rights and 
international
law.  The International community condemns Israel for indiscriminately
killing Palestinian civilians including children.  We need 
international
protection to Palestinian civilians and to enforce UN resolutions, in
particular, UNSC 242, 338 and UNGA 194. Israel should be suspended from
participation in United Nations System until it complies with its 
conditions
to admission and until it complies with basic principles the UN has set
forth, in particular the right to self-determination, the prohibition
against acquiring territory by force, and allowing refugees to return 
to
their homes and lands.  Europe must suspend the EU-Israel Association
Agreement, until Israel complies with the human rights clause (article 
2) of
the agreement.  The US should suspend military and economic aid to 
Israel
until it respects the Fourth Geneva Convention on Human Rights.



</p><p><b>MEMORIAL SITE</b> 
</p><p>Set up memorial sites in capitals for all Palestinian martyrs. Pictures 
can
be taken from Addameer's website (use US-mirror for quick download) at
<a href="/nigelparry.com/september2000/" style="pointer-events: none;">http://nigelparry.com/september2000/</a> click on "martyrs" to get the 
pictures
(not all are available but most).

</p><p>Call the media and tell them to cover it. Tell the media why you have 
set up
the memorial. Calls could be made to every mosque and church about the 
site.
You can organize a silent march; or hold candle vigils at the site.
Publicize the place of the site and we can post it around. Send the 
exact
place to <a href="/addameer.org/ym/compose?to=prrc@mail.com&amp;yy=28984&amp;order=down&amp;sort=date&amp;pos=1" style="pointer-events: none;">prrc@mail.com</a> (or post it on <a href="/addameer.org/ym/compose?to=al-awda@egroups.com&amp;yy=28984&amp;order=down&amp;sort=date&amp;pos=1" style="pointer-events: none;">al-awda@egroups.com</a>) and we can
mass distribute it and have the list of sites added to Addameer's 
website..

</p><p>Please add the following at the memorial: 1. A big sign that says "in 
memory
of the more than 80 palestinians who have been killed by israelis this
week"; 2. flowers (many many flowers) each person coming should bring a
flower; 3. candles; 4. notes of support and acknowledgment- prayers and
notes; 5. pictures of the victims, especially the 12-year-old boy shot 
in
his dad's arms; 6. volunteers who are ready to talk to the media about 
the
memorial.

</p><p>PICKETING

You can picket in front of every Israeli embassy or consulate. For the 
right
address check: <a href="/embassyworld.com/embassy/israel1.htm" style="pointer-events: none;">http://www.embassyworld.com/embassy/israel1.htm</a>

</p><p><b>TIPS FOR NON-VIOLENT ACTIONS</b> 
</p><p>This deals with tips for non-violent actions such as sit-ins in front 
of
UN-buildings; government buildings; Israeli embassies.

</p><p>Be clear about the objectives, to attract attention to the demands (see
above), it must be clearly understood by participants and clearly
articulated to passerby, media, police etc. It must be clear who is
responsible for what (coordination of action, communication with media, 
with
police, etc.) Provide written guidelines such as: not to provoke 
police; no
violent actions; etc.

</p><p>Make a sign-up sheet, it should be distributed including name, etc., 
phone
(preferably take your mobile with you), someone to notify (family, 
friends,
lawyer), special needs (medical care). A buddy system is recommended, 
in
particular in a "crowd scene". If intent is to challenge an order to 
leave
an area (in front of an Israeli embassy) the possible legal, financial, 
and
physical implications should be known (e.g. lawyer should be consulted
beforehand and preferably "on call") and if possible, thoroughly 
discussed
and considered by participants at a pre-action preparation session;
Reason(s) for challenge must be clear: e.g.. "we intend to stay until X 
is
done or Y stops being done". Those without preparation for being 
dragged,
should walk with arresting person.

</p><p>Affinity groups should be formed beforehand - at preparation sessions, 
with
one or two members of each not risking arrest; these should be 
responsible
for follow up if arrests occur (contact family, lawyer, media, visiting
prison, etc.) Importance of these roles should be stressed.

</p><p><b>SIGN THE PETITION:</b> 
</p><p>Send a request to hold A Special Session to Mary Robinson (UNHCR):

</p><p>UN Human Rights Commission, Mrs. Mary Robinson, High Commissioner,
Representatives of Member States, Fax: 0041-22-917 9018, Email:

citizens in
1948-Palestine. This petition will be sent to United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan to Demand International Protection for Palestinian
