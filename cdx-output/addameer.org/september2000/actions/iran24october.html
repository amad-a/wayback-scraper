<h2>
    Iranian pupils chant anti-Israeli slogans Tehran </h2>









<p>
  
 

(SAPA, 24 October 2000)

</p><p>Iranian schoolchildren nationwide began their school day on Tuesday
chanting slogans against Israel and the United States and in support of 
the
Palestinians after an appeal from the education ministry, state media 
said.
Millions of children chanted "Down with Israel", "Long live Palestine" 
and
"Down with America" before settling down to classes, radio and 
television
reports said. At Tehran's Ibn-Sina school, students interviewed on 
state
radio denounced the "savage violence" of Israeli troops in the latest
Middle East unrest which has left more than 130 dead and some 4 000 
people
wounded. "We want to express our abhorrence of Israel and our support 
for
the war and struggle of the Palestinians," two young students said. 
Iran
has been mobilising public opinion in support of the intifada or
Palestinian uprising in the wake of the latest violence. The Islamic
republic does not recognise the state of Israel and is opposed to the 
peace
process. Tehran has been pushing for the right of Palestinians to 
return to
their homeland. - Sapa-AFP
