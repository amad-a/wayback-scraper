</p><p>Urgent Appeal to Support East Jerusalem Hospitals

 For Emergency Treatment of Injured Palestinians in Current Clashes



</p><p>The Friends of East Jerusalem Hospitals appeals to you to support its campaign for the purchase of medical supplies and medicines urgently needed for Emergency, Surgery and Intensive Care departments at East Jerusalem Hospitals of Makassed, Augusta Victoria and St. John.



</p><p>The hospitals' staff have been working very hard to save the lives of injured people, who needed hospitalization during the ongoing clashes between Palestinian citizens and the Israeli army, that started last Thursday.



</p><p>To date, twenty Palestinians were killed and more than 500 injured, of which 5 were killed and 300 injured in Jerusalem. Clashes are still ongoing in Jerusalem and other Palestinian areas and more Palestinians are still being killed and wounded.



</p><p>We hope that you will respond to our urgent appeal by sending a donation to:



</p><p>Friends of East Jerusalem Hospitals<br>

The Arab Bank, Al-Balad Branch<br>

Ramallah, Palestine<br>

Account Number: 662018/3



</p><p>Or by hand to Hanadi Muaqqet at Orient House, Sheikh Jarrah, East Jerusalem.



</p><p>Thank you for supporting Jerusalem, its people and hospitals in their hour of need.











</p><p>Dr. Rafiq  Husseini<br>

Campaign Coordinator



</p><p>PS. A receipt will be issued as soon as a donation is received.
