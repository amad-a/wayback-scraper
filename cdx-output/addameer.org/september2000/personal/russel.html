<p></p><h3>Behind the Palestinian Uprising</h3>

<br>by Russell Maier and Gunhild Forselv
<br>Bethlehem/Ottawa, November 10th, 2000


<p>It is a custom that has been repeated all too often these last weeks.
In the memory a deceased Palestinian, their enlarged photograph is
plastered across the shops, mosques and buildings of villages and
cities. With the current Middle East conflict steadily escalating,
each passing day sees new posters crowd out those that have not yet
had time to become familiar.

</p><p>Since the beginning of the clashes September 28th, of the 162 people
killed and over 7000 injured, approximately 95% have been
Palestinians. Of these, the Red Crescent reports 25% are boys under
the age of 18. Their faces now cover the walls of their community. Why
are Palestinians risking the rubber and steel bullets to throw stones
at Israeli soldiers? The answer is locked up in years of brewing
frustration.

</p><p>Khalid, 29, is the coach of a boy's soccer team from Deheisheh refugee
camp. He has grown up here and shares the desire of most his fellow
Palestinians for peaceful co-existence with his Jewish neighbours. He
proudly describes having a Jewish sports colleague come to his home
for dinner. But according to Khalid, peace cannot mean a simple lack
of violence.

</p><p>"Peace is possible, but not now. Peace must be fair. How Palestinians
and Israelis live now is not fair. How the Israelis have treated us is
not fair."

</p><p>Khalid's disillusionment with the peace prior to the current unrest is
shared by his neighbour Muna Muhaisen, a Palestinian journalist.
According to Muna, and the current violence has been a long time in
coming. "People are so fed up." Expressing the reckless desperation
fuelling the uprising she added, "Everybody just wants it to blow to
hell".

</p><p>The frustration and anger of Palestinians like Muna and Khalid stems
from a multitude of grievances with the Israeli occupation over the
last 50 years. Perhaps most significant is the plight of the
Palestinian refugees. In 1948, over a hundred Palestinian farming
villages were vacated in the face of the advancing Israeli and
Jordanian armies. The fleeing peasants took refuge in UN tent cities
in Gaza, Lebanon, the West Bank and Jordan. All assumed that they
would soon be returning to their farm lands. Fifty two years later,
these same refugee camps remain; the tents exchanged for cramped and
naked concrete buildings. The populations of these camps have since
doubled and tripled, while their physical dimensions have remained the
same. Largely as a consequence of these the camps, the UN Department
of Social and Economic Affairs lists Gaza Strip as the fourth most
densely populated area in the world. In Gaza, where 80% of the 1.5
million Palestinian population are refugees, most of the camps do not
have drinkable running water, or fully functional sewage systems.

</p><p>Over the years, frustrations have further compounded as Palestians
have watched helplessly through the barbed wire, as one by one, the
hill tops around them have been claimed by Israeli settlers. The
majority of these settlers comprise Jewish immigrants from various
nations fleeing their own difficult circumstances. Most are enticed by
attractive housing packages offered by the Israeli government with the
goal of assisting diaspora Jews to 'return' home. According to the
Foundation for Middle East Peace (FMEP), a U.S. based monitoring
organization, there are approximately 200, 000 settlers and 200
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In the West Bank where 3
million Palestinians live, they take up 60% of the area. These
settlements, the equivalent of a modern Canadian suburb, are isolated
and self-sufficient housing complexes interconnected by roads designed
to systematically bypass Palestinian areas. Complete with trees,
grass, street lights and play grounds the settlements are in stark
contrast to the refugee camps that in some instances they neighbour.
Despite dozens of UN Security Council Resolutions since 1968
condemning settlement expansion and the protests of numerous
international human rights organizations, construction and expansion
continues unabated. According to FMEP, settler population growth in
1999 was three times that of Israel proper. Symbollically, the current
clashes in Bethlehem, Ramallah and Gaza, are staged close to these
settlements.

</p><p>Those Palestinians who are not refugees have also had their share of
mounting frustrations. Since March of 1993, travel for Palestinian
between the West Bank and Gaza has required a difficult to obtain
Israeli permit. In conjunction with a coloured license plate system
that distinguishes Israeli cars from Palestinian and Israeli military
checkpoints on all major routes, Palestinians have been forced to
endure heavily restricted mobility. Palestinian travel prior to the
current clashes inevitably involved the humiliating ritual of showing
one's identity card to young Israeli soldiers and random searches and
detainments. As a consequence of the limited ability to travel many
Palestinian families and friends have been separated for years. Gazans
working or studying in the West Bank often do not see their family for
years at a time. Despite the great significance of Jerusalem and the
Al-Aqsa mosque to Palestinians, most adults have yet to visit it
themselves.

</p><p>Due to the depth to which these frustrations penetrate Palestinian
society, the current uprising has united Palestinians from vastly
different political stripes, from Muslim fundamentalists to Israeli
Arabs. All seem to share a general sense of betrayal by the peace
process and the long endured institutionalized discrimination. For
years, peace has been discussed, documents signed and hands shaken.
Yet, for Palestinians like Muna and Khalid, there has been no
discernable improvement. Refugees are still in their camps,
settlements expand, travel remains restricted. Perceiving all other
avenues exhausted, the only recourse has been the all too familiar
stones and a new Intifada-- a Palestinian term for 'uprising' or
'struggle'.

</p><p>Oscar Wilde once wrote that the most dangerous man in the world is he
who has nothing to lose. This is perhaps nowhere more evident than in
the Palestinian men and boys on the front lines. Ahmad Issa, also from
Deheisheh, is a 15 year old whose brother's poster has covered the
camp's walls after being shot by an Israeli soldier. According to
Ahmed, there are only two alternatives. Palestinians can either
quietly suffer their bleak situation indefinitely or "fight with
honour for freedom and for the blood of those who have died." For
Ahmed, "At least this way we can live and die with dignity."
