<h3>The Reality of Israeli Occupation: <br>

A Syrian Golani Perspective </h3>
<p>


by Bashar Tarabieh 

</p><p>

Background:

</p><p>
3 January 2000 -- The approximately 17,000 Syrians who now live 
in the

Golan Heights are all that remain of the population of approximately

147,000 Syrians who resided there prior to the June 1967 war. The 
rest

fled or were expelled by the invading Israeli army from their villages

and towns.
</p><p>

International media coverage of the Israeli-occupied Golan rarely

makes reference to the Syrian Arabs who live there. Media coverage has

also downplayed Israel's consistent attempts to neutralize all dissent

by Syrian Golanis, as well as its denial of their cultural and

national identity and their efforts to achieve reunification with

Syria. It has also largely ignored Israel's attempts to incorporate

the Golani population to justify permanent retention of the Golan.

Instead, most media discussions of the Golan focus on the strategic

significance of the territorial dispute between Syria and Israel, and

on the fate of Israel's 17,000 settlers living there.

</p><p>
The lack of coverage of the native population is especially troubling

considering the harsh implications of 32 years of Israeli occupation.

The current Israeli-Syrian negotiations hold the fate of the Syrian

Golanis in the balance.



</p><p>The Aftermath of the June 1967 War:


</p><p>From the beginning of its occupation of the Golan, Israel attempted

to manipulate Syrian Golanis' communal identity. It did so through a

series of abusive policies that defied international human rights

treaties and the Fourth Geneva Convention governing the treatment of

civilian populations living under occupation.


Among other measures, Israel eliminated all institutional structures

that existed under Syrian rule, such as local councils and

agricultural cooperatives, and altered school curricula. Furthermore,

Israel expropriated all the lands of the expelled population and

immediately initiated an ambitious settlement plan to Judaize the

Golan, ultimately permitting the settlement of some 17,000 Jewish

settlers.

</p><p>
To increase the vulnerability of the small remaining Syrian community,

the military confiscated a belt of land surrounding the Syrian

villages and planted it with land mines, thereby preventing expansion

of agricultural production and choking village growth. In 1969, the

military evacuated the residents of Sehita (one of only six remaining

villages) to another village under the pretext of security, and

dynamited all its houses.

</p><p>
Israel also made the provision of basic services contingent on the

extent to which the Syrian Golani community conformed to Israel's

policies. In short, in the early years of occupation, Israel used its

disproportionate power to achieve total domination over the Golan's

native population.


</p><p>
Golani Resistance:

</p><p>
Throughout the 1970s, Golani activists made periodic, mostly covert,

attempts to organize resistance and assist Syria by passing

information to its government. Toward the end of the decade the

Israeli government began to contemplate the unilateral annexation of

the Golan.
</p><p>

The first step toward doing so came in 1978 when Israel offered the

community the option of taking Israeli citizenship. In response, the

community held public meetings and announced its uncondi-tional

rejection of annexation and unwillingness to change its national

identity.

</p><p>
Israel's response was to arrest and imprison five of the community's

elderly leaders. In a demonstration of support, over two-thirds of the

adult population appeared at their trial. Two years after Israel's

offer of citizenship, only a handful of Golanis had chosen to take it,

despite the fact that refusal to do so resulted in new repressive

policies. For example, between 1978 and 1982, Israel made issuance of

permits for home construction contingent upon acceptance of Israeli

citizenship, thus essentially freezing building during that period.

</p><p>

Response to Annexation:
</p><p>

When Israel annexed the Golan on 14 December 1981 in defiance of

international law, the community responded with a series of general

strikes followed by an open strike that began on 14 February 1982 and

continued for six months. This massive demonstration of resistance and

civil disobedience brought the Golan to the attention of the

international community, albeit temporarily; even the Arab media

failed to report regularly on the Golanis' struggle because of their

lack of access to the Golan.

</p><p>
Israel stationed some 15,000 soldiers in the villages to enforce the

imposition of citizenship-thereby outnumbering the local population,

then amounting to some 12,000 persons. During the strike, Israel cut

the villages off from the rest of the world and prevented food

supplies from entering the Golan for several months.
</p><p>

Realizing the magnitude of the resistance, Israel finally accepted a

compromise: Syrians of the Golan would not have to take Israeli

citizenship, but would remain "residents" (officially lacking any

nationality). Since 1982, no Golani Syrians have applied for Israeli

citizenship, and some of the few who previously did so have been

engaged for over ten years in a lawsuit to revoke their citizenship.

Such an option is almost impossible under Israeli law unless the

person agrees to emigrate.


</p><p>
Denial of Basic Human Rights and Services:
</p><p>

Throughout the 1980s, Israel continued its campaign of intimidation

and collective punishment in the Golan. Demonstrations and other forms

of protest were physically suppressed. Community projects, including

summer camps for children and independent kindergartens, were targeted

for closure. In the 1990s, Israeli authorities shifted their policies

toward a more selective form of suppression. Activists and their

families became the primary targets and were denied building permits

and the right to travel to Syria for study or other purposes. The

Israeli security apparatus hoped to intimidate the activists and thus

marginalize resistance.

</p><p>

Restrictions imposed by Israel encompass much of Golani life: 

</p><p>
In the village of Majdal Shams, for example, Israel confiscated the

clinic in 1967 and turned it into the headqurters of the military

governor's court. Until a local non-governmental organization

established an independent health care system in the Golan in 1992,

only three Israeli clinics served the entire Golan, each open only a

few hours a day, four days a week. Women experiencing difficulties

during pregnancy and others with such medical emergencies as work

accidents and heart attacks died because of the lack of emergency

health care;

</p><p>
Israel's security apparatus tightly controls the schools. Hiring

decisions are made on the basis of political quiescence rather than

academic qualifications;

</p><p>
A building crisis in all the villages stems from Israel's refusal to

expand the available building area and to provide building permits.

The result has been severe crowding and attendant safety and

environmental hazards. Moreover, three of the five remaining villages

lie next to Israeli-planted minefields. In the village of Majdal

Shams, for example, two minefields are in the midst of the village,

and a third borders it from the east;

</p><p>
Travel anywhere in the Arab world, including to other parts of Syria

to visit relatives, is prohibited for most of the adult population;

</p><p>
Due to repressive economic policies and land confiscation, agriculture

has ceased to be the main source of income, forcing many families to

rely on wage labor in the Israeli market (which discriminates against

Arabs). 

</p><p>

Cautious Optimism:


With the resumption of negotiations between Israel and Syria, Golani

activists are cautiously optimistic regarding the chances of returning

to Syria. Should the current talks result in the return of the Golan

to Syria, they will resolve a territorial dispute, contribute to

regional peace, and end the misery and disenfranchisement of the

Syrian Golani community. The activists are also preparing, however,

for a possible failure that would perpetuate Israeli rule and bring

about renewed efforts by Israel to impose citizenship on their

community.
