<h3>Jamal Al Durra</h3>

<p><b>Transcript of online discussion on arabia.com (October 30) </b>


</p><p>Jamal Al Durra: I am here at the Hussein Medical center undergoing 
treatment and operations. I will start answering your questions now. 
</p><p>
BBB: How are you feeling now? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: My situation is bad. My pelvis is shattered, I can't 
move my right arm properly. I had 3 surgeries on my arm already. I 
also had operations on my elbows. After my muscles heal, they will 
operate on my fingers. 
</p><p>
Samer4: Do you think that this Intifada is going to help the 
Palestinian people? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: The continuation of the Intifida will eliminate the 
Zionists and retrieve Palestinian lands and rights. 
</p><p>
Jongar: Is it true that the Israelis were really looking to kill the 
young boys by shooting on their heads? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: The Israelis intend to kill children less than 16 
years of age. So they won't grow up and build families. That is how 
they will annihilate the Palestinian people. 
</p><p>
3oqla: How many bullets hit you if I may ask? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: Eight bullets. There is one bullet remaining in my 
pelvis. 
</p><p>
Wael*: Jamal.. Where were you going at the time of the crime? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: I was leaving Gaza to go back home (Buraij Camp). We 
wanted to cross the road &amp; take a car back to the camp. 
</p><p>
basel: In the media they said it was cross shooting, is that right? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: The area I was at with my son didnâ€™t have cross 
fire. There was nobody there in that area, the shooting was aimed at 
us. </p><p>

Hanthalla: How many bullets hit your son? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: Four Bullets, The first in his right knee. I then 
called for help. My son told me that he wouldn't cry, that is when I 
raised my right arm to ask for help. They didn't stop firing at us, 
the gunfire increased. A bullet hit my right arm then I tried to 
protect Mohammad but bullets were coming from several locations. 
Soldiers were aiming at us. I tried to protect my son with my leg, 
Which was hit by bullets, that is when my pelvis was smashed, I used 
the cell phone to call the journalist Sami Ziara, he sent us an 
ambulance. The Israelis shot the ambulance driver Bassam Al Belbeisi 
dead. I called Sami Ziara again, and told him that the ambulance 
driver he sent us was killed. Sami told me that he was aware of the 
incident and that he sent us another one. The ambulance came, the 
driver couldn't reach us due to the heavy shelling. By then, my son 
was dead on my lap, I tried to protect him with and every part of my 
body but I couldn't. I was awake and aware of everything. I went to 
a hospital in Gaza, and the doctors nurses there thought I was 
unconscious so they were asking if anyone can identify me or Mohammad, 
I told them that I am completely aware of the situation, my name is 
Jamal Al Durra and this is my son the martyr Mohammad Al Durra. 
</p><p>
ArabCanadian: Jamal do you have any idea how many soldiers were 
shooting at you and your son? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: I couldnâ€™t lift my head to count, bullets were 
flying in all directions above my head. 
</p><p>
om ahmad: Mr. Durra How are Mohamed's siblings dealing with the loss 
of their brother? Are they getting any counseling? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: Mohammad has 7 brothers &amp; sisters, their psychological 
situation is really bad. They always ask about Mohammad, I donâ€™t 
know what to tell them. I didnâ€™t see my son when he was buried, nor 
did I see my other children since then. They are arriving on Tuesday 
to Amman. 
</p><p>
NaDeEm: WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THE ISREALI CLAIM THAT YOU AND YOUR 
SON WERE CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: It wasn't Israel that stated that. Madeline Albright 
was the one who came up with that claim. The area we were in was 
vacant. Israelis were shooting constantly for 45 minutes aiming at one 
location, and that is where we were hid. 
</p><p>
Dina: did the Israeli army ever apologize for the killing of your son 
"god rest his soul"? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: They didn't approach in any way, I asked for an 
international trial, but Clinton rebuffed it. And threatened to use 
the right of VETO. 

female.....24: Jamal what do you think Arab 48 should do to help u 
in west bank? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: The Intifida should continue in the 48 &amp; 67 lands. 
Also in the PNA territories, because the continuation of the Intifada 
is a liberation process for us. 
</p><p>
MemeIraqia: what do you think of Yasser Arafatâ€™s situation? Please 
answer! 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: Arafat's position is a peaceful one, he always seeks 
peace. But Israel always betrays the deals and the decisions of the 
security council and sends its jets and tanks into Palestinian camps 
to kill people and children. And they consider themselves facing a 
formidable force (Palestinian Stones). 
</p><p>
THE STAR: are you satisfied by the role of the Arab countries at the 
Intifada... is it enough that they send food and medicine, or you 
think that the only good thing they have to do is to start the war 
against Israel? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: We thank the Arabs for supporting the Intifida with 
Money, food and Medicine. Naturally, we ask them to eliminate borders 
and send armed volunteers to fight the enemy. The USA will always be 
on the Israeli side, if Arabs don't unite we wouldn't be able to 
get rid of Israel. 
</p><p>
khalid: Did any Arab leaders approach you? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: Muammar Al Qaddafi and King Abdullah of Jordan, also 
Delegations from different Arab countries visited me on behalf of 
their leaders. 
</p><p>
Same: What do you like to say to the Arabs leaders? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: I call upon the Arab leaders to take the necessary 
steps to stop the Israeli invasion on the Palestinians and boycott all 
diplomatic ties with Israel. 
</p><p>
sam112: Are you satisfied with the enormous media coverage concerning 
your case and the death of your son or do you consider it something 
personal and should not be discussed internationally? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: This is not personal, it is the case of the 
Palestinian people, a whole nation. The media coverage that took place 
showed a small fraction of the terrorism that Israel is practicing 
against Palestinians. Now the whole world can see what the Nazis are 
doing and be aware of their repression practice. 
</p><p>
*SELENA*: Mr. Durra, with all great respect, I know that you are in 
terrible grief. A loss of a child or loved one is a terrible 
experience. I wanted to know from today on forward, since the Clinton 
administration rebuffed your plea, are you going to go through any 
other channels for the honor of your son? And if so what are those 
means? Again, my deepest apologies...May God bless you and your family 

</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: I will try all possible means, I will not forget or 
forgive. I wasn't shocked when my son died, it is not his case alone, 
it is every single person's case in the Palestinian nation. 
Recently, a little girl was leaving school with a backpack on her 
back, she was shot dead by Israelis. These atrocities happen daily, my 
tragedy was caught on camera and theirs wasn't. 
</p><p>
ROHI LE FALASTIN: What do you think us Arabs and Muslims in Europe and 
the rest of the world can do to help?? </p><p>

Jamal Al Durra: Arabs in US and Europe, should pressure US into 
applying UN resolutions to Israel. The Security Council's 
resolutions were applied to Arab countries like Iraq but never to 
Israel, WHY? It astonishes me, especially that the US can see 
what the Israelis do to our children and people. 
</p><p>
falastinieh: Are you having the right treatment in Amman? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: Yes, everybody has been great, medical staff, 
Government, and the people. </p><p>

Ali: how long are you going to stay in hospital? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: 6 Months to one year, I will be undergoing many 
surgeries throughout this time period. 
</p><p>
Hanthalla: I am sorry for such a question. Do you think your son's 
death (Ra7mat Allah 3ale) has changed many things in your life such as 
your view towards politics? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: Mohammad is neither the first martyr nor the last, my 
view towards life was altered long time ago. 
</p><p>
THE STAR: After what happened, do you have any idea in your mind that 
peace is still possible? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: Peace is war and the elimination of Israel. They 
started the aggression by bombing civilians' houses. 
</p><p>
dameer: tell us more about Mohammed? His life? How was he in school? 
ur relation with him? His mother's relation with him? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: I raised my children properly, I treated them as 
friends more than a father. I love them and care for them very very 
much. Mohammad was a courageous boy, he hated injustice. He respected 
everybody, he was mature for his age. He had a strong mentality, he 
was not shy. He loved to play, and he adored the sea. He loved 
picnics and spending times with his family. He was a very generous 
boy, he shared everything he had and owned. His teachers admired him. 
</p><p>
UpRiser: what dreams did he have for his life? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: He wanted to become an engineer or a doctor. 
</p><p>
basel: there are many Israelis looking at your answers now what would 
u like to tell them? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: They are not worth my answer. 
</p><p>
Dream: did you consider forming a pressure group for the parents who 
lost their children in order to take your case to the whole world? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: I urge everybody to ask for their rights from Israel; 
through an international court. 
</p><p>
RAHIM: what do you think of the current events, like the entry of 
Israeli tanks in Gaza? 
</p><p>
Jamal Al Durra: They penetrate Gaza with tanks, and we penetrate them 
with stones. 

</p><p>x-con: if you went back in time, what would you actually do to your 
son? 

</p><p>Jamal Al Durra: Mohammad is dead, and there is nothing we can do. 

</p><p>Jamal Al Durra: I blame the US government for not taking any action to 
convict Israel for their atrocities against unarmed civilians, and I 
blame Albright , the wicked witch, who said that the death of my son 
was not intentional. I have one question for her, 45 minutes of aimed 
fire at me and my son was not intentional? She was dancing with the 
Japanese children while the Palestinian children were being 
slaughtered. I convict the online Israeli media for putting a Jewish 
hat on my head and the head of my son, as if to reverse roles. Israel 
claims that Arafat pushes our children into resisting the Israelis, 
Arafat didn't ask anybody to do that. It is an inner motive for 
every Palestinian to fight against Sharon who desecrated our holy 
sites with the blessings of Barak. Palestinian people with motives 
gave birth to the Palestinian Intifada, not because Arafat asked for 
it, because they are bored of occupation and injustice. 

</p><p>I thank arabia.com for giving me this chance to speak out. Peace be 
upon you
