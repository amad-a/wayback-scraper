</p><h2>Latest Developments No. 30 - Friday 13 October 2000, 5:33PM GMT+2,  Ramallah, West Bank </h2>



<p>
After an extremely tense night in areas throughout the West Bank and Gaza, 
clashes have erupted all over the occupied Palestinian territories in 
protest at yesterday's unprecedented Israeli attacks, which continued 
through the night.
</p>

<p>
Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported further Israeli attacks in Gaza this 
morning.
</p>

<p>
Despite Israeli warnings before yesterday's attacks being given to the 
Palestinian Authority, many Palestinian civilians were unprepared for the 
events.</p>


<p>
Following yesterday's warnings, Palestinian Authority officials immediately 
visited schools to close them down, telling the teachers and children to go 
home quickly. Parents rushed to schools to try and find their children, but 
in the mass hysteria that followed, many children were lost in the 
confusion, which led to large traffic jams.</p>


<p>
Palestinian organisations report widespread fear and shock among the 
population following the rocket attacks on Palestinian cities.</p>


<p>
Reuters reports that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said today that he had 
ordered an inquiry into the mob killing of two captive Israeli soldiers, but 
did not confirm that he had ordered the arrest of some of those responsible.</p>


<p>
The Ananova news agency reports that Israeli Cobra helicopters have been 
hovering over the Gaza City port today as tension mounted.  The helicopters, 
which bombed targets yesterday, did not fire. Today, from the shore, Israeli 
gunboats are visible again positioned along the Mediterranean Sea border of 
Gaza.</p>


<p>
The BBC reports that Israeli reserve troops have been mobilised and all 
leave cancelled. Israel Radio says that, if the violence persists, the army 
will be authorised to seize strategically-important positions in areas 
directly controlled by the Palestinians.</p>


<p>
Brief clashes erupted earlier in Jerusalem today after Friday noon prayers 
at Al-Aqsa Mosque. Hundreds of Palestinians under 45 were barred from 
entering the mosque compound for the prayers, and prayed instead by the 
roadside. Ten injuries were reported in the Hizma neighbourhood as a result 
of these clashes.</p>


<p>
Armed confrontations are currently taking place in Ramallah, Hebron, 
Tulkarem, Rafah, and Jenin. Israeli security forces are enforcing a strict 
blockade of the occupied Palestinian territories, with tanks encircling 
Palestinians cities.</p>


<p>
Reports from Bethlehem, where clashes are taking place near the Israeli 
outpost at Rachel's Tomb, cite a number of injuries, including one person 
who is in critical condition after receiving live ammunition to the head.</p>


<p>
In Hebron, according to Ha'aretz newspaper, shots were fired towards the 
Psagot settlement and Israeli troops and Israeli settlers fired at stone 
throwers. Addameer has learnt of at least 17 injuries from live ammunition 
in Hebron so far today, three of which are reportedly in critical condition.</p>


<p>
The total number of injuries from last night's Israeli attacks in Ramallah 
was reported to be 30. Clashes currently are taking place near the northern 
entrance to Ramallah, edging onto the Al-Bireh Industrial Zone. At 3:30pm 
Palestinian Time (GMT+2), Israeli tanks fired three missiles into the Zone 
over a period of 15 minutes.</p>


<p>
Eyewitnesses report that one man in Ramallah, shot with live ammunition from 
a heavy machine gun, had his leg completely severed by the ammunition.</p>
