<p>
In a continuation of Israeli settler violence
against Palestinians, numerous areas throughout
the West Bank and Gaza, and 1948 areas reported
continued settler attacks throughout the day, and
carried on late into the evening.  In Jenin,
Nablus, Bethlehem, Hebron, Khan Younis and Rafah,
Israeli settlers attacked school children on
their way home from school today.  In some
instances, Israeli settlers shot at children near
their schools.  </p>


<p>
In the village of Silt Al Thaher in the Jenin
area, armed Israeli settlers attacked three
Palestinian schools, in addition to nearby
houses.  Palestinian cars traveling along the
main road of the village, connecting Jenin to
Nablus and Tulkarem, were also attacked by the
settlers, with a number of injuries reported.  
</p>

<p>
In Ya'bad, also near Jenin, armed Israeli
settlers, under the protection of the Israeli
military, attacked school children at their
school on the outskirts of the village, shooting
at the school and at children attempting to flee
to their homes.  In order to reach their homes,
children had to pass through the settlers and
soldiers, after which clashes erupted.  Several
injuries were reported.  </p>


<p>
In Hossan village near Bethlehem, another
Palestinian school was attacked by Israeli
settlers under the protection of the Israeli
military.  Clashes followed the assault, which
are on going.  A number of injuries have been
reported, including an ambulance driver.  The
ambulance driver was attempting to reach those
injured when the ambulance was shot at, the
driver pulled out of the car and severely beaten
by Israeli settlers.  Israeli settlers also
attacked a mini-bus carrying disabled children to
Bethlehem, smashing the windows of the bus. </p>
 

<p>
In Rafah, Gaza, Israeli settlers within an
Israeli military post shot at school children on
their way home from a nearby school.  Several
injuries were reported.  Brief clashes erupted as
the children passed the military post in order to
reach their homes.  One 12 year old child is
reported to be clinically dead as a result of
live ammunition to his head.  At least 2 other
injured are said to be in critical condition. 
Further settler attacks of school children were
also reported in Khan Younis, near the Kfar Darom
and Gush Katif settlements. </p>
 

<p>
Earlier this morning, a second apartment complex
was attacked by Israeli rockets and destroyed on
Al Shuhada street near Netzarim Junction.  The
complex had been evacuated three days earlier as
it had already witnessed several rocket attacks. 
On Erez, Carmi and Rafah border crossings, 20
shipping trucks were burnt with their contents,
with another 70 trucks smashed and a number of
parked cars destroyed by Israeli settlers.  The
vehicles have been unaccessable to their
Palestinian owners as they are in an Israeli
military controlled area. </p>


<p>
In the Ramallah area, clashes erupted again this
afternoon near the northern entrance of the city,
with a number of injuries reported.  Ra'ed
Hammoudi, currently in Ramallah hospital, is
reported to be in extremely critical condition
from live ammunition.  Recent reports state that
Israeli settlers have been stoning Palestinian
cars at the nearby Jalazone Refugee Camp.  Jamal
Abdel Hamid, 40 years old, is reported to be in
extremely critical condition in Ramallah hospital
after his car was attacked by settlers near Ofra
settlement.  Jamal was dragged out his car,
severely beaten, and thrown to the side of the
road.  His skull was damaged, causing internal
bleeding, as a result of the attack.  Nearby
Birzeit University announced that all of its
classes will be shortened to half an hour, ending
the university day at 2:00 PM as a result of the
danger faced by students traveling home after
5:00 PM.    </p>


<p>
In Umm Safa, Israeli settlers and Israeli Police
sealed off the entrance of the village and have
been preventing anyone from entering or leaving
the area after the funeral of Issam Judeh today. 
Later this evening Israeli settlers under the

village, attacking houses, smashing windows and
destroying cars.  Clashes are on-going, with
reports of live ammunition fire.  No further
information is available. </p>

 
<p>
Nablus has been declared a closed military zone
by the Israeli Authorities.  Israeli settlers
attacked several villages around Nablus,
including the villages of Yitmah and Howarrah. 
Howarrah has been under Israeli-imposed curfew
for three days.  During the curfew today, Israeli
settlers, under the protection of the Israeli
military, attacked houses and smashed windows and
cars, forcing residents to come out of their
homes to defend themselves.  Upon leaving their
homes, Israeli soldiers shot at residents after
being charged with breaking the curfew.  At least
10 injuries from live ammunition have been
reported. </p>
 

<p>
In Jerusalem, settler attacks continue throughout
the night.  Several roads leading from local
neighborhoods to the center of Jerusalem have
been sealed off by settlers.  Reports of houses
being attacked in Beit Hanina and Bir Nabala
continue.  Attempts by settlers to burn the Latin
Patriarchate church during last night's attacks
were unsuccessful.  However, attempts to attack
churches within Jerusalem neighborhoods continue
tonight.  In the old city of Jerusalem, a
Palestinian was severely beaten and injured by a
sharp object to his head by Isreali settlers. 
Makassed Hospital in Jerusalem reported that this
was the 17th palestinian to come to the hospital
as a result of such attacks within the last three
days. </p>
   

<p>
In the 1948 areas/inside the Green Line, a number
of cities reported settler attacks on Palestinian
workers during the day.  In Haifa, Jewish
residents attacked Palestinian residents and
destroyed three tombs within a nearby Islamic
cemetary.  Clashes stopped after Israeli police
interfered.  </p>
 

<p>
In Akka, clashes erupted briefly after several
hundred Jewish residents of the New City attacked
the Old City - in which there are only arab
residents - smashing shops and cars in the area. 
Israeli Police closed off the area, after which
clashes erupted.  Police used live ammunition and
tear gas, resulting in a number of injuries,
including one Palestinian shot in the mouth with
