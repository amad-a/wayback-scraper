SEPTEMBER 2000 CLASHES INFORMATION CENTER 
Palestine: http://www.addameer.org/september2000/
North America:  http://nigelparry.com/september2000/

</p><p>Mass protest rallies took place throughout the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, with clashes reported in Gaza, Hebron, Ramallah and 
Nablus.  In the majority of areas in the West Bank and Gaza, the 
internal closure has been partially lifted.  However, a number of 
villages in the North remain inaccessible.   

</p><p>In Nablus, residents of Askar Refugee Camp reported late this 
afternoon that armed Israeli settlers escorted by a Israeli military 
jeep, shot at areas within the camp from nearby Jabal Al Shamali 
(Mount Ebal).  Zahi 'Arrda, 34 years old, from Askar Refugee Camp 
in Nablus was shot by live ammunition to his stomach and killed as 
a result of the attack this afternoon, with several other Palestinians 
injured.  Armed confrontations erupted following the incident, after 
which the Israeli military deployed tanks, armored cars and attack 
helicopters. Zuheir Al Qardah was killed during the attack, in 
addition to 17 Palestinians injured, including civilians within their 
homes, some of which are in critical condition.  Israeli evening 
news reported that one of the settlers on the mountain was also 
killed.  

</p><p>Clashes were reported in Bethlehem and Hebron this afternoon, 
with at least 10 injuries reported.   An explosion occurred this 
afternoon in the Palestinian Force 17 headquarters in Bethlehem, 
killing two Palestinian security officials.  The blast, originally 
thought to be an Israeli attack, was later explained by Palestinian 
officials as being the result of a faulty gas canister in the kitchen 
of 
the headquarters.
