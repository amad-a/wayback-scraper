</p><h2>Latest Developments No. 34 -

  West Bank 
</h2>



<p>
As the final statement of the Sharm Al Sheikh
summit was being made 
this afternoon, Farid
Moussa Issa Massassrah, 28 years old from 
Beit
Farouk, Nablus was shot dead by Israeli settlers
while picking olives in 
his family's olive grove.
 Israeli settlers, under the protection of 
the
Israeli military, attacked Palestinian farmers
harvesting olives in 
their orchards in Beit
Farouk, firing live ammunition at the farmers. 

Farid was shot in the head with live ammunition,
and three others were 
injured, including Farid's
cousin, Majdi Mahmoud Issa, 42 years old 
from
Beit Farouk, who was shot by live ammunition in
his chest, and remains 
in critical condition. 
Ambulances were prevented from entering the 
area
to transport the injured, in addition to
preventing civilian cars 
carrying those injured. </p>


<p>
Mohammad Hassan Taleb Al Dakheel, 26 
years old,
from Nablus, died this afternoon as a result of
injuries 
sustained on 2 October.  Mohammad has
been in critical condition for the 
past 17 days
after being shot in the head by live ammunition. 
</p>


<p>
Thousands of Palestinians participated in the
funeral of 14 year old 
Muayad Osama Abd Al
Jawarish from Aida Refugee Camp, Bethlehem, who
was 
killed yesterday after being shot with live
ammunition to his head.*  
Severe clashes erupted
following the funeral in the Bethlehem area. 

Exchange of fire was reported near the Southern
entrance of Bethlehem.  The 
Southern Commander of
the Israeli Defence Forces stated this 
evening
that one soldier was wounded and is in critical
condition.   He stated 
further that tanks had
been deployed around Beit Jala, and that 
Israeli
attack helicopters would be brought in if the
situation did not calm 
down.  Recent reports
state the Israeli helicopters are preparing 
to
attack the village.  </p>


<p>
At Beit Hanoun/Erez Crossing in Gaza, Nabil 
Sa'ed
Abed Khater, 41 years old, from Shaja'iyeh, Gaza,
and a member of 
the Palestinian National
Security, was killed after being shot in 
the
chest by live ammunition.  At least 40
Palestinian workers were injured 
after clashes
erupted at the crossing, including Jalal Abu
Hajar, 30 
years old from Jabalya, who is in
critical condition from live ammunition 
to his
stomach.  Reports received this past hour state
that Rafah 
Refugee Camp has been attacked by
Israeli helicopters firing LAW missiles, 
with 4

</p>


<p>
In Ramallah, clashes erupted once again at the
Northern 
entrance of the city.  There have been
no reports of serious injuries thus 
far.  Recent
reports state that heavy gunfire is being heard
from the 
nearby Israeli settlement of Pisgot.</p>


<p>
In Jenin this afternoon, 
Israeli settlers
attempted to destroy 55 dunums of Palestinian
Olive 
orchards in the area.  Olive harvesting is
one of the main livlihoods for 
many villages in
the West Bank and Gaza.  Jenin has been declared
a 
closed military zone by the Israeli
authorities.    </p>


<p>
Clashes 
continued throughout other cities in the
West Bank in protest to the Sharm 
Al Sheikh
agreement.   A strict internal closure remains in
place 
within the West Bank, despite agreements
made this afternoon to lift it.  
Israeli
controlled areas of Hebron remain under curfew
for the 18th 
consecutive day, with attacks by
Israeli settlers reportedly taking place in 
the
evening.   The village of Huwarra remains under
curfew for the 10th 
consecutive day.  The
majority of villages and towns in the 
northern
West Bank remain completely isolated from one
another, with a number of 
areas declared closed
military zones.  The prevention of 
medical
supplies and food reaching these areas continues.</p>



<p>
This afternoon, 
medical supplies and equipment
flown in to Egypt and intended to be 
transported
to Gaza for Palestinian hospitals was prevented
from entering 
by the Israeli authorities on the
Egypt-Gaza border crossing. 
</p>

posted 11:50 PM GMT+2,

was shot in his stomach.   He was shot to 
the
head with live ammunition on his way home from
school.

The September 2000 Clashes Information 
Center website, http://www.addameer.org/september2000/ was down this 
evening.  Both Palestine Online and Planet, the two local service providers 
hosting the site, went down between 8PM-10PM.  Our service provider has 
managed through great risk to his personal safety to get to the server 
in order to repair the problem.  The server is near Jerusalem, which is 
currently blocked off by Israeli military checkpoints. We are currently 
in the process of moving the site to be hosted outside the country for 
increased reliability and security.  In the event that the server does 
go down again, we will continue to offer regular updates through our 
contacts abroad.  Please note that our mirror sites at the moment are:
