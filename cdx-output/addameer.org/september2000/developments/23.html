</p><h2>Latest Developments No. 23 - Tuesday 10 October 2000,Web posted 3:00am  (GMT+2), 

  Ramallah, West Bank </h2>

<p>In Yaffa, Israelis have set fire to both Al 'Ajami and Hassan Bek mosque in
the center of the city, in addition to a number of Palestinian homes.
Thousands of Palestinian residents have been trying for the past two hours
to put out the fires.  Clashes have erupted around the Hassan Bek Mosque
between Palestinian and Jewish residents, with at least one Palestinian
reportedly stabbed.  The main road between Tel Aviv and Yaffa has been
sealed. </p>

<p>The Follow-Up Committee for Arab Affairs have decided to take the following
actions in light of the recent attacks: 
</p><ol>
<li>1.  Demand the removal of Minister Shlomo Ben Ami from his post as Public
Security Minister;  
</li><li>2.  Issuing an urgent memorandum to the United Nations;  
</li><li>3. Forming an emergency committee to follow up the current situation.
</li></ol><p></p>

<p>
Two attacks on the office of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak have been
reported.  In the first, an Israeli motorcyclist attempted to attack the
office, reaching the steps of the office before being arrested by Israeli
security.  Half an hour later, the brother of the assailant also attempted
to attack the office, but was apprehended before he could reach it.</p>
