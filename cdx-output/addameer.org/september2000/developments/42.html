  Yesterday, we reported that clashes took place in Ramallah at the "'Ma'loufiyeh', 
  where the majority of clashes took place in Ramallah in 1996 after the opening 
  of a tunnel by the Israeli Authorities under the Al Aqsa Mosque Compound". The 
  tunnel was in fact opened alongside the Al Aqsa Mosque Compound. For further 
  information on the clashes in 1996, visit the "On The Ground In Ramallah Website
