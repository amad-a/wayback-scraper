</p><h2>Latest Developments No. 20 - Monday 9 October 2000,Web posted 3:00 a.m.  (GMT+2), 

  Ramallah, West Bank </h2>
<p>
Following attacks in the eastern neighborhood of
Nazareth, a large number of injuries have been
admitted to local hospitals. Omar Mohammad
Ibrahim Akkawi, 44 years old, from Hai al Wurud,
Nazareth was killed as a result of live
ammunition.  Mohammad Al Khattib, from Yaffa,
Nazareth and Ibrahim Al Mahshi, from Nazareth,
have been transferred to Rambam hospital in Haifa
and declared clinically dead.  At least 7 other
people have been reported to be in extremely
critical condition.  The situation in Nazareth is
calmer at this point.  However, Israeli police
are preventing anyone from entering or leaving
Nazareth. 
</p><p>
Attempts by Arab Parliamentarians and the
Follow-Up Committee for Arab Affairs to secure
the immediate intervention of Israeli Parliament
Members and Ministers (Knesset) to call on the
Israeli police to stop the aggression against
Palestinians in Nazareth were unsuccessful.  As a
result of the failure of the Israeli government
to protect residents, a number of Arab
Parliamentarians and local leaders within the
community have called for international
protection.    
</p><p>
Thousands of Palestinians participated in marches
this evening throughout Jenin, Bethlehem, Gaza
and Ramallah to protest the violence against
Palestinians in Nazareth.  
</p><p>
Israeli settlers continued their attacks on
Palestinians within East Jerusalem, shooting live
ammunition, rubber coated steel bullets and
smashing cars and shops.  Tanks and armored
military vehicles were deployed along the
Jerusalem main road near Shufat and Beit Hanina. 
A number of injuries have been reported.  
</p><p>
The main roads from Tubas to Jenin and Nablus
have been sealed off by Israeli settlers, who
have been attacking Palestinian cars traveling
along these roads, and in at least one incident,
beating passengers.
