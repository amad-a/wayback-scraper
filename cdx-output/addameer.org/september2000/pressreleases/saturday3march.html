<b>Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians over last 24
            hours</b>

 

<p>
In the past 24 hours, the Israeli forces have escalated their attacks
on Palestinian civilians. They have tightened the siege imposed on 
the
Palestinian towns, especially Ramallah and el Bireh, where they 
have
placed more barricades on the roads connecting Jalazone refugee camp,
Dura el Kari’ a, and Ein Yabroud with Ramallah and el Bireh. The
Israeli forces’ escalation of attacks have resulted in the killing of
three Palestinians during the last 24 hours. A fourth has died of
wounds of an earlier shooting. Apparently in all four cases, those
killed had not been taking part in any demonstrations or clashes and
were not posing any threat to Israeli soldiers or settlers when they
were killed.

On Friday, 2 March, Israeli forces stationed at Psagot settlement
reportedly opened fire at Palestinian residential areas in el Bireh
hitting 9-year-old Obai Daraj in the chest. Based on LAW Society’s

<h3> <a name="haq">Al Haq</a></h3>
<b>Three Palestinians Killed by Indiscriminate Israeli Fire,
One Dies of Previously Sustained Injuries</b>

<p>
</p><p>Despite repeated condemnation by the international community 
Israel continues to use indiscriminate and excessive force against 
Palestinian civilians. Israeli Occupying Forces killed three 
Palestinians yesterday, one a child of eight, and another child died 
of wounds sustained earlier in the week. None of the three 
individuals killed yesterday were involved in clashes with Israeli 
forces at the time of their deaths. Al-Haq fieldworkers collected 
the following information regarding each of these cases.</p><p>
At approximately 3:30 pm Israeli forces located near the 
settlement of Psagot opened fire on El Bireh using tanks and 
heavy machineguns. The shelling lasted for fifteen to twenty 
minutes and left eight-year-old Obei Mohammad Mahmoud 
Darraj dead. Statements given by Obei’s father to an al-Haq 
fieldworker state that Obei was killed while playing in his 
bedroom. A large caliber bullet penetrated his bedroom window 
and struck him in the chest, exiting through his back. Obei’s 
family had moved into their apartment one week prior to this 
incident to escape from the heavy shooting to which their previous 
home was subjected. Neighbors report that prior to the Israeli 
shelling a domestic dispute in the neighborhood resulted in one 
shot being fired into the air, and it was this shot that brought about 
the unprovoked Israeli attack. This case is typical of other recent 
cases in which one or two shots, not necessarily aimed at Israeli 
areas, lead to unrestrained Israeli shelling and shooting of 
inhabited areas, which can last for minutes or hours and has lead 
to numerous deaths and injuries and extensive property 
damage.</p><p>
Also killed yesterday was Abdul Karim Issa Abed Abu A’sbe, 
age 23, from Qalandiya Refugee Camp. Abdul Karim was shot 
three times as he walked from his home to a nearby market. 
Witnesses told an al-Haq fieldworker that Abdul was shot by 
soldiers involved in nearby clashes even though he had taken no 
part in the demonstrations. One bullet hit him in the hand and two 
in the stomach. He was rushed to the Ramallah Municipal 
hospital where he immediately died. He leaves behind a wife and 
newborn baby. Two other individuals were injured while 
attempting to give him assistance.</p><p>
Earlier in the day Mustafa Hamdan Abdul Qadir Ramlawi, age 42, 
from Bureij Refugee Camp in Gaza was killed by Israeli forces 
who shot him in the head and chest. He was killed on the main 
road between the al-Mintar and al-Shuhada junctions in the south 
of Gaza. He was mentally handicapped and frequently wandered 
through this area. There were no clashes in the area when he 
was killed.</p><p>
Mohammad Mahmoud Helis, age 13, from al-Shaja’a in Gaza also 
died of wounds sustained during clashes near the Karni Crossing 
on 27 February. He had been shot in the head several times and 
was only being sustained by a respirator.
</p><p> These killings are clear demonstrations of Israel’s complete disregard for 
  Palestinian life. Until the Israeli authorities are forced to take responsibility 
  for their actions innocent Palestinian civilians will continue to be killed. 
  Al-Haq therefore demands that, 
</p><p>1. The international community take appropriate action to 
sanction Israel for its continuous shelling of Palestinian civilian 
areas. Israel’s targeting of civilian areas is illegal under 
international law and constitutes a war crime that should be 
investigated. Those found responsible for committing or 
ordering the commission of such crimes should be tried. 

</p><p>2. States Party to the Fourth Geneva Convention act 
immediately to provide the Palestinian people with protection 
from Israeli human rights violations and demand an end to 
abuses committed by Israeli forces. Israel continues to 
commit grave breaches of the convention that obligate States 
Parties to act under Article 1, which calls for them “to respect 
and ensure respect for the present Convention in all 
circumstances.”

</p><p>3. The Security Council and the UN General Assembly end its 
indefensible silence regarding Israeli’s blatant violations 
against Palestinian’s human rights. 

</p><p>4. The international community take the necessary measures 
to pressure the Israeli Government to stop its excessive use of 
force and aggression against Palestinian civilians and to end its 
belligerent occupation. 
</p><p>5. The Security Council reconsider its decision regarding the 
deployment of an international protections force for the 
Palestinian people and immediately take steps to form such a 
force to ensure Israeli compliance with United Nations 
Resolutions and international law. 

</p><p>6. The Palestinian National Authority immediately take all 
steps possible to discourage and prevent all unreasonable 
shooting from residential Palestinian neighborhoods.
