<b>Stop the Killing of Children</b>

 

<p>


On Saturday a nine-year-old Palestinian boy was killed by Israeli

security forces gunfire north of Al Bira. A week prior, IDF soldiers

shot and killed 15-year-old Husam a-Disi from Qalandya Refugee 
Camp.
</p><p>
According to testimonies collected by B'Tselem, Husam a-Disi was 
hit

by four live bullets, three of which entered his back. The boy was

shot while throwing stones at IDF soldiers from a distance of about

100 meters.

</p><p>
Since the eruption of violence in the Occupied Territories on

September 29, 2000, Israeli security forces have killed 88 Palestinian

children. Some 4000 children have been injured. This, in addition to

the 281 Palestinian children killed since 1987.
</p><p>

The policy Israel employs for dispersing demonstrations in the

Occupied Territories is the reason why so many children are hurt both

by live and "rubber" bullets:

</p><p>
Open Fire Regulations: B'Tselem has repeatedly warned against the

phenomenon of "trigger happy" soldiers who shoot even when their lives

are not in danger.  Throwing stones at protected soldiers from a

distance of 100 meters cannot be considered life threatening.

</p><p>
"Rubber" Bullets: B'Tselem renews its demand that Israeli security

forces obtain non-lethal means of dispersing demonstrations, and thus

put an end to the killing of children. "Rubber" Bullets.
