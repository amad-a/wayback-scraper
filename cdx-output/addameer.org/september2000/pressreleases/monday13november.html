<p><b>Curfew Lifted in Hawwara, Resumed in Hebron 
</b></p>

                            

  <p>Dear Colleagues,

</p><p>I am pleased to inform you that the curfew on the Palestinian village
of Hawwara, near Nablus, was lifted yesterday (12th November),
after
being imposed by the Israeli army for the past 45 days. The four
government schools in Hawwara, serving 1558 pupils,  have
resumed
their work. Moreover, pupils who live in Hawwara who attend
schools in
the city of Nablus managed to go to their schools.

</p><p>The curfew on the city of Hebron, imposed by the Iareli for the past
45 days, was lifted for three hours yesterday. Around 50% of the
12,000 pupils in the 28 schools in the city of Hebron went to school
yesterday. The rest did not go. The parents were afraid to send
them
to schools because of the heavy Israeli military presence near their
houses or in the streets or because of their fear of Israeli settlers
in the city. In fact, the Israeli soldiers threw tear gas canisters
into one of the schools (Mohammadieh Basic School for Boys).
Eight
students lost consciousness because of inhaling gas and had to be
lightly treated.

</p><p>Today (13th  November), the curfew was resumed on the city of Hebron.
Furthermore, four schools in the city are still used as Israeli army
posts.

</p><p>In the coming days, I will write to you about the attempts of parents
and the community in the city of Hebron to keep the process of
learning going on under the present difficult circumstances.

</p><p>Khalil Mahshi<br>
