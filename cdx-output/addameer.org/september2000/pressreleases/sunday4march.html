<b>Seven Palestinian civilians killed and 18 injured by Israeli forces
within 48 hours:  International community called upon to establish
Criminal court or tribunal to prosecute perpetrators of War crimes</b>

 

<p>
Three more Palestinian civilians were killed last night, including one
woman, and 5 injured (3 under the age of 18, including a 10 year 
old).
These willful killings and willfully caused injuries are a result of
the policy of escalating violence and excessive force used by Israeli
forces against Palestinians, at the instigation of, and resulting from
threats made by, Israeli army commanders and political leaders 
against
the Palestinian people.
</p><p>
The Palestinian civilians killed were :
</p><p>
·   Baher Shafik Mahmoud Oda, 18 years old, Hawara Village;<br>
·   Ahmed Hasan Hahmed Alen, 18 years old, Kariot Village, in Nablus
region; <br>·   Ida Daoud Musa, 43 year old woman of El Berih.
</p><p>
These killings has raised the number of those killed within the last
48 hours to 7, including amongst them two children. 18 have now been
injured, including 8 under the age of 18 years old (the youngest being
6 years old). None of the Israeli soldiers or settlers involved in
these deliberate killings or willfully caused injuries have been
investigated or are being prosecuted.
</p><p>
According to LAW’s documentation, at 8.30 p.m. last night inhabitants
of Hawara village saw unusual cars with Israeli number plates in their
village. Some of the  Palestinian youths from the village tried to
block their route and threw stones at the cars. The occupants of the
Israeli cars were Israeli soldiers disguised as Palestinians:
otherwise known as “el Mustaribeen”.
</p><p>
The Israeli forces fired heavily upon the Palestinian youths. As a
result of the excessive and disproportionate force used by the Israeli
forces:  one of the Palestinian youths, Baher Shafik Mahmoud Oda, was
killed. He was killed by three bullets of live ammunition. He was shot
once in the stomach, once in the leg, and once in the back. In the
same incident three other men were injured, whose names are:
</p><p>
·   Morad Lafi Hasan, 20 years old, severely injured;<br>
·   Akram Ali Terwari, 17 years old, shot by live ammunition in the
shoulder;<br> ·   Suleiman Abraham Ouda, 16 years old, injured.
</p><p>
At 8.30pm on 3 March 2001, a settler from Gilo settlement deliberately
fired at Ahmed Hasan Hahmed Alen, 18 years old from Kariot, whilst he
was driving his car on his way back from Ramallah, where he works, to
his village. He was shot with live ammunition in the head and died
immediately. There were no clashes or demonstrations taking place and
no firing by Palestinians against the settlement, when Ahmed was
murdered by the settler.
</p><p>
At 7.30 pm last night, Israeli occupying forces in the Israeli
settlement of Basgot, situated in el Tawila Mountain, attacked the 
Friends School, in El Bira using heavy weaponry. Ida Daoud Musa, a
resident of El Bira, was walking on the street and  was passing
Friends school with her son and daughter, when she was hit with a 5 mm
live ammunition bullet. The bullet entered her chest, damaging her
internal organs before it settled in her upper right leg. Her
daughter, Nadil Musa, 12 years old, was hit by shrapnel in her left
arm.  Another woman was also injured with shrapnel in her left arm in
the same incident: Wafee Ahmed Muhammed Karan, 42 years old. No
clashes or demonstrations were taking place at the time and there was
no shooting from Palestinians at the Basgot settlement when the
Israeli forces attacked the school.
</p><p>
LAW condemns these increasing acts of violence, willful killings and
willfully caused great suffering and serious injury by the Israeli
forces against Palestinian civilians.
</p><p>
LAW also condemns the threats being made by the Israeli political
leaders and military commanders.
</p><p>
LAW asks the International Community to immediately act to stop these
grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention, amounting to war
crimes that are being perpetrated against Palestinian civilians. It
asks the International Community to establish a Criminal Court or
Tribunal to bring the perpetrators of these war crimes to account, and
to take positive measures to protect the Palestinian people.
