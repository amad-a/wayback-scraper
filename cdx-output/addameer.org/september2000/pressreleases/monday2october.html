<h2>National Council on Canada Arab Relations</h2>
Ottawa, October 2, 2000 
<p>The National Council on Canada Arab Relations (NCCAR) calls on the Canadian 
  Government to immediately condemn Israel's campaign of terror against Palestinians. 
</p><p>The provocative visit by Ariel Sharon triggered the violence and Israel must 
  bear full responsibility for its consequences knowing all too well that previous 
  visits by Sharon, the "hero" of the Sabra and Shatilla massacres have resulted 
  in violence. 
</p><p>Since the outbreak of the confrontation on Thursday, Israeli security forces 
  killed over 35 civilians, and injured over 1000. According to reports by independent 
  observers, and human right groups Israeli forces are shooting at protesters 
  indiscriminately. The same sources stated that most of those killed and injured 
  were targeted by live ammunition clearly intending to inflict as much damage 
  as possible. 
</p><p>The blood letting of innocent civilians praying at the mosque underscores Israel's 
  unwillingness and inability to protect and secure access for non Jews to their 
  holy sites and lends credibility and necessity to Palestinians' claim that they 
  should retain full sovereignty over their Occupied East Jerusalem. 
</p><p>The National Council calls on Honourable Minister Axworthy to intervene with 
  Israeli officials to stop at once the carnage and restart meaningful negotiations 
  that ensure the implementation of international law as expressed by UN security 
  Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the Geneva Convention.

<h2>Palestinian Centre for Human Rights</h2>
<p>Attention Mr Giacomelli UN Special Rapporteur to the Occupied Palestinian Territories 
</p><p>2 October 2000 
</p><p><b>Subject: Illegal Israeli actions in the occupied Palestinian territory</b> 
</p><p>Dear Mr Giacomelli, 
</p><p>On behalf of the Palestinian people, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, 
  as human rights defenders and a human rights organisation based in the occupied 
  territory would like to address the above urgent matter. 
</p><p>As you are aware, violence erupted in Jerusalem, and has escalated between 
  Palestinian civilians and the Israeli Occupation Forces since Thursday 28 September 
  following the visit of Ariel Sharon to the compound of the Dome of the Rock, 
  one of the holiest sites for Islam. Such a gesture was immediately interpreted 
  as an act of provocation intended to highlight Israeli control over Muslim holy 
  sites in Jerusalem. This has had the effect of derailing the peace process negotiations 
  which in any event was evolving on a very fragile basis. Nevertheless, the Government 
  of Israel facilitated Ariel Sharon's visit by providing hundreds of Israeli 
  soldiers as his escort. 
</p><p>Clashes were reported during Ariel Sharon's visit and several Palestinians 
  were injured in the area of the Dome of the Rock and subsequently in other locations 
  of the West Bank. 
</p><p>On Friday, 29 September, Israeli Occupation Forces reinforced their presence 
  within the site of the Dome of the Rock. Civilian protests were met by heavy 
  shooting with live ammunition, rubber coated bullets and teargas. Seven Palestinians 
  were shot dead by the Israeli Occupation Forces and more than two hundred were 
  injured – thirty civilians were critically injured. Soon after, the protests 
  spread to different parts of the West Bank and more than one hundred civilians 
  were reported injured. 
</p><p>Since the early morning of 30 September, protests took place throughout the 
  occupied Palestinian territory. More than seventy civilians were injured in 
  the Gaza strip. The majority of them are under the age of 17. Clashes between 
  Palestinian civilians and Israeli Occupation Forces occurred near the Israeli 
  settlements of Netzarim and Kfar Darum in the middle areas of the Gaza Strip, 
  in Khan Younis, Rafah and Erez crossing borders. 
</p><p>In three days of clashes the number of Palestinian victims amount to 28 dead 
  and more than 600 hundred injured during the widespread confrontations. The 
  Palestinian Red Crescent Society indicates that over 900 injuries are reported 
  at various emergency rooms of which 96 are caused by live ammunition. Most of 
  the victims are civilians, who in their protests did not resort to the use of 
  weapons. Stone throwers were being fired at by the Israeli Occupation Forces 
  using live ammunition, rubber coated steel bullets including anti-tank missiles 
  (lau). 
</p><p>The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) reports that its ambulances were 
  prevented from entering various affected areas and thus have been unable on 
  many occasions to reach the wounded persons. Furthermore, four PRCS vehicles 
  were directly hit by gun fire, and one emergency medical personnel has been 
  shot and killed in the Gaza Strip on Saturday 30 September, while driving wounded 
  persons to the hospital. 
</p><p>In light of the above, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights holds the Government 
  of Israel and the Israeli Occupation Forces responsible for the widespread violence 
  in the occupied Palestinian territory. It was first triggered by the attempt 
  of Ariel Sharon to visit the Muslim holy site in Jerusalem, then fueled by the 
  unjustifiable and heavy presence of Israeli troops inside the compound of the 
  Dome of the Rock during the Friday prayers. 
</p><p>Furthermore, PCHR condemns the Israeli Occupation Forces excessive use of force 
  and other related grave breaches of the Fourth 1949 Geneva Convention: 
</p><p>The non respect of the principle of proportionality under international humanitarian 
  law, whenever the use of force is necessary. 
</p><ul>
  <li>The use by Israeli Occupation Forces of live ammunition, rubber coated steel 
    bullets and teargas, including the use of snipers in response to stone throwing 
    civilians, mostly youth (60% of the wounded persons are under 20 year). 
  </li><li>The attacks on medical personnel, in particular the Palestine Red Crescent 
    Society, carrying out vital life-saving operations. 
  </li><li>The killing of twenty eight Palestinians, in particular the killing of seven 
    Palestinian civilians within a religious site during gathering for prayers 
    and the killing of ten children ( seven under 18 years old, two under 13 years 
    and a baby of one and a half years). 
  </li><li>Many of the six hundred casualties (78%) are in critical conditions suffering 
    from injuries of the upper parts of the body (chest, heart, head, eyes) indicating 
    clear intention of shoot-to-kill.
</li></ul>
<p>In view of the above substantive information confirmed by the presence of international 
  media as well as independent observers, and in light of your mandate conferred 
  by resolution 1993/2 A of 19 February 1993, we call upon you to investigate 
  these specific Israeli violations of international human rights law and grave 
  breaches of international humanitarian law, in particular the Fourth 1949 Geneva 
  Convention. 
</p><p>We count on your supportive attention in this urgent and grave matter. We would 
  be grateful if you inform us promptly on your concrete action with regard to 
  this dire situation, as we believe that many more Palestinians may die in the 
  next days. 
</p><p>Respectfully yours, 
</p><p>Raji Sourani<br>
  Director, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights<br>

<p>The Center for Economic and Social Rights deplores the current round of Israeli 
  violence against Palestinians. In the last 5 days at least 50 Palestinians have 
  been killed and more than 1000 injured in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. 
</p><p>The Israeli army has been using overwhelming and disproportionate force against 
  Palestinian protesters. The Israeli army has been firing at civilians indiscriminately, 
  entering Palesitnian controlled areas (in violation of the Oslo Accords), putting 
  numerous communities under siege, firing from tanks and helicopters and using 
  missiles, snipers and rockets against civilians and in densely populated neighborhoods. 
  Much Palestinian property and numerous homes have been destroyed by Israeli 
  rockets and missiles. 
</p><p>Israel is blatantly violating its committments under the IV Geneva Conventions, 
  the UN Charter, numerous human rights treaties and the Oslo Accords. Despite 
  this, the situation is depicted in the US press as the fault of the Palestinians. 
</p><p>Inside Israel, the Palestinian community is also under siege, with nine deaths 
  and hundreds of injuries in Palestinian towns and areas such as Arabi, Umm al 
  Fahm, Haifa, Jaffa and Nazareth. Mass arrests are taking place amongst Palestinian 
  citizens of Israel who are exercising their basic rights. There are even reports 
  of Israeli police entering hospitals to arrest wounded demonstrators. 
</p><p>CESR has launched a new section on its website (www.cesr.org): BREAKING NEWS 
  FROM PALESTINE which will be updated regularly. In addition, CESR endorses the 
  following actions occuring this week in NYC in support of the Palestinians under 
  siege. Events in other parts of North America are listed on our website as well 
  as suggestions for contacting your local media.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Letters to the High Commissioner of Human

<font face="Verdana" size="2">
<p>Dear Friends, 
</p><p>Al-Haq jointly with Al-Mezan, sent a letter to both the High Commissioner of 
  Human Rights Mrs. Mary Robinson, and the United Nations General Secretary Mr. 
  Kofi Annan, requesting immediate intervention to stop the massacres and to use 
  all means to guarantee the protection and safety of the Palestinian civilians. 
</p><p>October 2, 2000 Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Kofi Annan 
</p><p>Fax: (07-2820966) 
</p><p>Dear Mr. Annan, 
</p><p>Since Friday, September 29, 2000 until the writing of this letter, the Israeli 
  forces continue their aggressive actions in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. 
  They have opened fire against Palestinian civilians in the al-Haram al-Sharif 
  and in other parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. As a result 34 Palestinians 
  have been killed and hundreds more have been injured. Many of the injured and 
  killed were under the age of 18. The majority of the injuries (over 60 %) were 
  to the upper parts of the body. In a dangerous and unprecedented move towards 
  the escalation of the violence, the Israeli forces launched anti-tank missiles 
  in the Gaza Strip into a populated area, resulting in tens of casualties among 
  Palestinian civilians. The excessive use of disproportionate force intended 
  to kill and injure the highest number of people is clear. We the signatories 
  to this letter confirm the following: 
</p><p>1. The excessive use of lethal force by the Israeli Military against Palestinian 
  protestors is a violation of international humanitarian law and the principles 
  of proportionality. 
</p><p>2. The large number of injuries to the head and chest indicates the deliberate 
  intention of the Israeli forces to inflict the highest number of casualties 
  and unnecessary suffering among civilians. 
</p><p>3. The Israeli forces' excessive force was used against non-combatants and 
  illegal targets: innocent bystanders, journalists and medical personnel were 
  deliberately targeted. Previously, Al-Haq has documented the deliberate targeting 
  of journalists, and again, have evidence during the present clashes that there 
  was deliberate targeting. 
</p><p>4. The excessive use of disproportionate force, using live ammunition, deploying 
  snipers, using anti-tank missile, and assault helicopters to disperse Palestinian 
  demonstrators is unjustifiable and an aggravation of the situation resulting 
  in the escalation of violence. 
</p><p>5. There has been a deliberate negligence in using non-violent riot control 
  methods. 
</p><p>Due to the grave circumstances, we al-Haq and al-Mezan , are addressing you 
  in your capacity as the Secretary-General of the United Nations. We are requesting 
  that you take immediate action, through your high standing in the international 
  community, to stop these massacres and to use every available means of contact 
  and mechanisms to guarantee the protection and safety of civilians in times 
  of war. The situation is deteriorating and calls for the intervention of the 
  international community to stop the systematic killing of Palestinian civilians.
