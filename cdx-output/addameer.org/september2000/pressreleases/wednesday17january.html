12 January 2001 


</p><p>Security Council 
2000 Round-up 

</p><p> 

</p><p>
Developments in Africa and renewed violence in the Middle East were 
among the major issues dealt with by the Security Council in 2000, as 
it pursued its mandate of securing, establishing and maintaining 
global peace and security. Also dominant on the Council's agenda this 
year, as in 1999, was the situation of Kosovo, Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, and East Timor. 

</p><p>

The Council met three times to discuss the situation in the Middle 
East, from 3 to 5 October, after violence erupted following a visit to 
Al-Haram Al-Sharif in Jerusalem on 28 September by Ariel Sharon, 
leader of Israel's Likud Party. More than 40 speakers addressed the 
Council. 
</p><p>
Following the debate, on 7 October the Council adopted resolution 1322 
(2000) by 14 votes in favour to none against, with 1 abstention 
(United States). By the text, it deplored the provocation carried out 
at Al-Haram Al-Sharif, and subsequent violence there and throughout 
the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, which had resulted in 
more than 80 Palestinian deaths.

Situation in Middle East 

</p><p>From 3 to 5 October, after an outbreak of violence that followed a 
visit by 
Israel's Likud Party leader, Ariel Sharon, to Al-Haram Al-Sharif in 
Jerusalem on 28 September, the Council met three times to discuss the 
situation in the Middle East, including the question of Palestine. It 
heard from over 40 speakers. 
</p><p>
During the debate, many speakers suggested that the Council must act 
to act to ensure it fulfilled it responsibilities, in particular to 
the Palestinian people, and to ensure that its previous resolutions 
were acted upon. Speakers were highly critical of the level of force 
used by the Israeli Government in response to Palestinian protests. 
</p><p>
Israel's representative told the Council said it was regrettable that 
at such a sensitive time in the Middle East peace process, the 
Palestinians had once again decided to resort to violence for 
political gain. 
</p><p>
The Permanent Observer for Palestine said that what had happened could 
only be understood as Israel trying to break the will of Palestinians, 
and the Council must end Israel's brutal campaign and its violations 
of international law. 
</p><p>
Following that open debate, the Council met on 7 October and adopted 
resolution 1322 (2000) by 14 votes in favour to none against, with 1 
abstention (United States). The resolution deplored the provocation of 
28 September, and the subsequent violence which had resulted in more 
than 80 Palestinian deaths. It condemned all acts of violence, 
especially excessive use of force against Palestinians. It also 
stressed the importance of a mechanism for an objective inquiry into 
events since 28 September, to prevent their repetition. 
</p><p>
On 22 November, during an emergency Council meeting on the Middle 
East, the Observer for Palestine called for specific measures to end 
Israeli violations against the Palestinian people, while Israel's 
representative said that Palestinian leaders continued to call for an 
escalation of the current conflict. 

</p><p>The Non-Aligned Movement called on the Council to seriously consider 
immediate deployment of a protection force in the region. The United 
States said any outside observer force would require the agreement of 
the parties to the conflict. The Council should not impose something 
that was opposed by one side. 


</p><p>On 18 December, the Council met to consider a draft resolution to 
establish a United Nations force of military and police observers in 
the occupied Palestinian territories, but the draft did not receive 
the necessary nine-vote majority (8 in favour to none against, with 7 
abstentions). 

</p><p>A number of speakers said that while an observer force might, at some 
stage, be useful, it was not timely given current peace negotiations. 
Others argued that the Council should not wait for bilateral peace 
efforts to run their course and that establishing an observer force 
could substantially contribute to stability.

assured Palestinians they could not rely on the Council for justice.
