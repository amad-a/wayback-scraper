<b>SAMWU Statement in support of all Palestinian workers</b>



<p>SAMWU would like to endorse the protest action being taken in 

Johannesburg,

outside the Israeli Trade and Tourist Offices in Rosebank at 1pm today, 

by

the Palestine Solidarity Committee.



</p><p>Inside Israel, police contingents have killed nine and wounded hundreds 

of

Palestinian citizens of Israel in northern towns like Nazareth and Umm

al-Fahm. In Jerusalem, the mass arrest campaign has resulted in a total 

of

over 350 Palestinians arrested, according to reports from various human

rights organizations and the Orient House.



</p><p>South African workers have experienced the very same decades of similar

oppression and brutality under the apartheid regime, out of which 

Israel

benefitted enormously. The latest attempts to force the Palestinians to

accept an imposed agreement are leading inexorably towards an 

apartheid-like

domination of Israel over a Palestinian bantustan.



</p><p>SAMWU's sister union in Egypt, the General Trade Union of 

Administrative and

Social Services Workers, has fiercely condemned the intensification of

violence in the Middle East. This violence is impacting more and more 

on

Palestinian workers, who already face massive discrimination.



</p><p>The Workers Advice Centre in Nazareth has documented the plight of 

growing

numbers jobless Palestinian workers who are forced to use the street 

corners

as an employment bureau where they stand around hoping for a day's 

casual

labour. The research shows that Israeli employers only pick up Gazan 

workers

who have permits, and Israel grants permits only to those who already 

have

work. This discriminatory practice has led to massive corruption where 

work

permits must be bought by the unemployed Palestinians from Israeli 

agents

for large sums of money. Even temporary jobs at $5 per day only go to 

people

with family connections. This discrimination follows on Israel's 

opening of

its gates to 250 000 workers from Thailand, Romania, Jordan and Egypt 

who

were seen as a more reliable labour force than the troublesome 

Palestinians.

This gesture led to massive abuse of workers in sweatshops and 

increased the

problem of joblessness amongs Palestinians.



</p><p>The union believes that all progressive organisations should share the

outrage expressed internationally by the murder of Palestinian children 

and

workers.
