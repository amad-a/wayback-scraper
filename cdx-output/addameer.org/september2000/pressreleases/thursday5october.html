<h2> ICCO AND IKV</h2>
Zeist, The Hague 5 October 2000 <b>ICCO AND IKV: DUTCH GOVERNMENT MUST TAKE SERIOUS 
STEPS TO STOP VIOLENCE IN ISRAEL/PALESTINE</b> 
<p>With the use of excessive violence by Israeli forces the disturbances in the 
  occupied territories have strongly escalated this week. ICCO, the Interchurch 
  Organisation for Development Co-operation and IKV, Inter Church Peace Council, 
  urge the Dutch government to take on the international level further steps against 
  Israel. The Dutch government already recognised Israeli responsibility for the 
  recent violent confrontations. It must now suit the action to the word and pursuit 
  international protection for Palestinian civilians and the establishment international 
  committee of inquiry. For a real solution, Israel must withdraw from all occupied 
  territories, and implement the right of return of Palestinian refugees. 
</p><p>Palestinian non-governmental organisations in the Palestinian territories and 
  in Israel have rightly demanded that international sanctions should be imposed 
  against Israel. 
</p><p>The Dutch government must seriously take this demand into consideration. The 
  Netherlands has obliged itself to actively persue the fulfilment of the (Fourth) 
  Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of 
  War (1949). This convention is applicable to the Occupied Territories and East-Jerusalem. 
  Additionally, within the European context, the Netherlands has political responsibility. 
  In the Association Agreement between Israel and the European Union, clauses 
  are included regarding human rights. 
</p><p>According to ICCO and IKV, the Netherlands has political, moral, and legal 
  responsibility and can apply existing agreements to end the excessive violence 
  and the violations of human rights in the Palestinian territories and Israel. 
  Within the UN Security Council, the Netherlands must seek temporary international 
  protection of Palestinian civilians and the formation of an international inquiry 
  committee to investigate the violations of international law. 
</p><p>For the ultimate resolution of the conflict, the Netherlands must demand implementation 
  of the relevant UN-resolutions that call for the immediate withdrawal of Israel 
  from all in 1967 occupied territories, according to UN-resolution 242 and 338 
  and the implementation of other UN-resolutions such as the right of Palestinian 
  refugees to return. 
</p><p>ICCO and IKV support the demonstration that will be held this Friday 6 October 
  in The Hague.

<h3>Defence for Children International/Palestine Section</h3>
<b>UPDATE: 17 Palestinian Children Martyred by Israeli Military Forces </b> 
<p>Over 65 Palestinians have been killed in ongoing confrontations between Palestinian 
  protestors and the Israeli military. According to DCI/PS documentation, no less 
  than 17 Palestinian children have been martyred, and 3 other children have been 
  declared clinically dead. In addition, over 2,000 Palestinians have been injured, 
  with at least 12 children having been shot in the eyes by the Israeli military 
  forces. To date, approximately 550 Palestinians have been arrested, with 350 
  from Jerusalem, and at least 200 children. 
</p><p>Since the beginning of the confrontations and in addition to the brutal force 
  used against Palestinian protestors, Israeli soldiers and settlers have attacked 
  Palestinian civilians and their property in areas all over the West Bank and 
  Gaza Strip. In Bethlehem, approximately 9,000 residents living in the area around 
  Rachel's Tomb are living in terrible conditions. Last night, the Israeli occupation 
  forces attacked the electricity generator, leaving most residents of Bethlehem 
  and Beit Jala without electricity throughout the night. Approximately 100 houses 
  in the area have been effected by live bullets, either by destroying water tanks 
  on the roofs, or from bullets entering the house itself. The Israeli army has 
  occupied around 30 residential buildings, evacuating families residing on the 
  top floors, and using the roof to fire on Palestinian protestors. Families in 
  Al-Aida and Al-Azza refugee camps and residents on the north side of Bethlehem 
  have been most seriously affected. Near Bethlehem, Israeli settlers attacked 
  the village of Teku'a, firing live ammunition towards at least 6 houses, terrorizing 
  residents and destroying property. In the village of Beit Sahour, adjacent to 
  Bethlehem, Israeli military forces occupied a private home two nights ago. The 
  family, including both parents and five children, were imprisoned in the bathroom 
  for approximately 5 hours while Israeli soldiers fired live ammunition at Palestinian 
  protestors. The house has been completely destroyed as a result. In addition, 
  in the past 2 days, approximately 100 families have vacated the area as people 
  fled the random shooting of the Israeli military. Approximately 40 of those 
  houses have sustained damage from the bullets. 
</p><p>In Hebron, a 24-hour curfew has been in effect for the past 4 days in the Old 
  City, preventing the approximately 40,000 Palestinians living in the Israeli 
  controlled area from leaving their homes for any reason, including seeking medical 
  treatment. Residents of the area indicate that due to the length of the curfew, 
  families are experiencing a food shortage. Also, in the Hebron area, the Israeli 
  army occupied several houses in the Al-Sha'aba area, near the illegal Israeli 
  settlement of Kiryat Arba, to the northeast of Hebron. According to DCI/PS fieldwork, 
  the homes of Rabi'a Skafi, Bilal Jabari, and Zuheir Al-Sayyouri have been occupied. 
  In the Tel Rumeida neighborhood of Hebron, Israeli soldiers occupied several 
  more houses, transforming them into military installations. Moreover, Israeli 
  settlers attacked several homes in the area and destroyed Palestinian property. 
  Dozens of families have fled the Old City and Tel Rumeida areas in fear of the 
  random attacks of soldiers and settlers. In Yatta, south of Hebron, Israeli 
  settlers set on fire Palestinian agricultural land. 
</p><p>In Ramallah/Al-Bireh, the Al-Balu'a area, at the city's northern entrance, 
  has been under constant attack. Homes in the area have been hit with live ammunition, 
  including 500mm rounds and ammunition from helicopter gunships. Again, the Israeli 
  army occupied 3 homes, turning them into military installations and terrorizing 
  the families in the process. The homes have been seriously damaged as a result. 
  Residents of a 6-story building in the area, owned by Mohammad 'Abd Al-Dayyam, 
  fled the fighting, after which the Israeli military entered the building and 
  destroyed most of the apartments. The Israeli army also entered the homes of 
  the Al-Deek and Al-Nabout families and destroyed furniture in the houses. Similar 
  incidents occurred last night in the Jebel Al-Taweel neighborhood, including 
  an attack on the home of the Al-Aqel family, during which a Palestinian girl 
  was injured. 
</p><p>In the city of Nablus, the areas around the Tomb of Joseph, in particular Amman 
  and Al-Quds streets and Balatta refuegee camp, have suffered from intense Israeli 
  gunfire. Between 20-30 families residing on Al-Quds Street have been evacuated 
  due to the assault, as well as between 1,000 to 1,500 residents of the Harat 
  al-Hashasheen neighborhood, adjacent to the site of the Tomb. On Amman Street, 
  a bomb entered the home of a Palestinian family, injuring 7 people. The Israeli 
  assault on Nablus has included the use of live ammunition from the ground and 
  air, via helicopter gunships, anti-armor weaponry (LAW missiles), as well as 
  machine guns firing shells 10cm long and 3cm wide. In the northern West Bank, 
  Al-Aqaba village, which is surrounded on all sides by Israeli military camps, 
  is currently under 24-hour curfew. Residents there are suffering from food shortages. 
  In Beit Dajjan, a village of 6,000, the Israeli army entered, cutting electricity 
  and destroying personal property. 
</p><p>In Rafah, in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military violently occupied the building 
  of the Hassan Al-Soutari family, ordering the 15 members of the family living 
  there, including the children, to lay on the ground, initially, and then forced 
  them to remain in the ground floor apartment all last night. The military used 
  the home as a base from which to fire upon Palestinian protestors. The extensive 
  gunfire, including firing missiles, has totally destroyed the building. In the 
  same area, an educational institute has been completely destroyed by gunfire 
  and missiles. Moreover, families fled a 6 floor residential building, near Netzarim 
  settlement, in fear, following which soldiers launched attacks on Palestinians. 
  This building has also been completely destroyed. Residents of the Abraj Hayineda 
  neighborhood of Beit Hanoun, in the northern Gaza Strip, have fled their homes 
  in fear after seeing the Israeli army transporting tanks and ammunition to the 
  Gaza Strip and helicopters hovering over the region. 
</p><p>In light of the above, DCI/PS calls for the following: 
</p><ol>
  <li> That the Israeli government immediately end its brutal assault on Palestinian 
    civilians and release all Palestinians arrested during recent clashes, especially 
    children. 
  </li><li> That the international community immediately intervene to protect the lives 
    and property of Palestinian civilians from the ongoing Israeli attack. 
</li></ol>
