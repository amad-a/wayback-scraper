<p><b>Mass arrests in Jerusalem and northern Israel often
 followed by
                              police beatings
</b></p>





  <p>"A culture of impunity around the Israeli police is resulting in
police brutality, ill treatment, threats and beatings," according to a
new report issued today by Amnesty International.

      </p><p> The report titled "Mass arrests and police brutality" is based on
     the
findings of an Amnesty International delegation which visited
Jerusalem and northern Israel from 21-29 October. In it, the human
rights organization strongly criticises the procedures and treatment
of those arrested over the past six weeks in Jerusalem and northern
Israel.

      </p><p>"Palestinians, including children, were frequently arrested from
      their
homes in the middle of the night in a highly intimidatory fashion,"
Amnesty International's researcher and member of the delegation,
Joanna Oyediran said.

      </p><p> Iyad Qaymeri, aged 17, and three other Palestinians were among a
     group
of young men and boys throwing stones in Shu'fat in East Jerusalem,
when they were arrested at 9.30pm on 1 October 2000. He was reportedly
set on by five soldiers who pushed him to the ground shouting insults,
kicking and hitting him on his body and in his face. They were taken
to what appeared to be a military camp where they were hooded and
forced to lie on the ground for about two hours; from time to time
someone would come and kick them or hit them. The four were then taken
to the Moscobiyyeh detention centre in Jerusalem. The night before
Iyad Qaymeri's release on 5 October, police officers allegedly entered
the cell and randomly beat the 30 Palestinians under 18 held there,
whilst yelling insults at them.

    </p><p>   Yoav Bar, a computer programmer,  described how immediately after
     his
arrest during an initially peaceful protest in Haifa on 2 October he
was dragged by the legs for more than 50 meters by two police officers
with his back sliding along the street, while other police officers
beat him with batons. He was beaten again in a police car. He told the
police that he thought his hand was broken; the police refused to give
him any medical treatment. Yoram Bar Chaim, who protested at the
treatment of Yoav Bar, was also arrested and beaten. They were both
released about midnight. Yoav Bar's left hand was broken in three
places. Two of his ribs were broken, and two of his front teeth were
broken. His back was also injured as a result of being dragged along
the street.

      </p><p> Amnesty International's latest report strongly criticises the
     breaches
in judicial procedures regarding the arrest and detention of children,
especially as regards Palestinian children.

      </p><p> "As a matter of routine, children were not summoned to the police
station but arrested,  often during the night, in an intimidatory
fashion. During their interrogation some children were reportedly
subjected to psychological pressure by being shouted at, insulted or
threatened during interrogation. In some cases children were
reportedly beaten by the police," Amnesty International said.

      </p><p> In Kufar Kana, a Palestinian village in Galilee, Bakr Sa'id, aged
     15,
was arrested on 24 October by a group of armed police who surrounded
his house around  2am. Four police, their machine guns ready, entered
the house, frightening the children and taking away Bakr Sa'id. He was
interrogated the same night with shouting and threats - which were
also heard by another detainee in the same station; the detainee said
that when he tried to speak later in court to Bakr Sa'id a police
officer slapped the boy in the face. Bakr Sa'id was released on 3
November.

      </p><p> Amnesty International welcomed the Israeli Government's
     announcement
yesterday that it would set up a full judicial commission of inquiry
under the 1968 Commission of Inquiry Act to investigate clashes with
the security forces in which Arab and Jewish Israeli citizens were
killed and wounded.

     </p><p>"However, it is essential that its investigations should be
     thorough,
effective and independent.  It should investigate incidents of torture
or ill-treatment by security forces and any report must be made fully
public," Amnesty International said, "Those responsible must be
brought to justice."
