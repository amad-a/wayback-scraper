<b>Total siege of Palestinian towns within the Occupied Territories: 
New
Israeli government imposing more restrictive collective punishments 
on
Palestinian civilians </b>

<p>
At 1 a.m. this morning Israeli soldiers imposed a total siege of
Palestinian villages within the Occupied Territories. They have dug a
trench and installed a blockade, starting from Sorda village near
Ramallah, from Ein Sheikh Yusef, up to the town of Bir Zeit.  The
trench and blockade is 2 metres into the earth, and it is about 150
metres in length. This total siege prevents any access to or out of
the areas by vehicle.
</p><p>
25 Palestinian villages, and their 65,000 residents, have been
affected by this closure, in particular El Mizra'a el Qiblia, and Abu
Qash, Kobar, and Abu Shkhedim. The Israeli soldiers, in the course of
digging up the trenches and installing the blockade have destroyed the
water pipes (the only water supply outlets) and telephone cables of
these villages. The residents are left without any water or telephone
access.
</p><p>
Students of Bir Zeit University are meant to start the new University
term on 17 March 2001. However, the five thousand students attending
the University will be unable to gain access as all access roads and
routes to Bir Zeit University from other Palestinian villages or towns
have been closed off by Israeli soldiers.
</p><p>
Other than Bir Zeit, these villages will also suffer from lack of
access to medical treatment or care, as there are no hospitals or
medical clinics in these villages. The residents would usually go to
Ramallah for medical treatment, however all movement by vehicle out of
the villages is prohibited. Furthermore, the Israeli forces are also
stopping the delivery of any crucial supplies into the villages,
including medical supplies.
</p><p>
According to Dr. Albert Aghazarian of the Public Relations department
of Bir Zeit University, and other residents of the 25 villages
affected, there have been no recent clashes or demonstrations in the
area.  Furthermore, there have been no shootings from these villages
at Israeli soldiers or settlers. There are no genuine security or
military reasons for taking these measures. The total siege is being
imposed by the Israeli government as a repressive form of collective
punishment, which is prohibited by international humanitarian law.
</p><p>
LAW demands that the Israeli government stops its violations of
international human rights and humanitarian law by ending the total
siege imposed on these Palestinian villages.
</p><p>
LAW demands that the residents of the 25 villages be immediately
granted access to essential supplies (including water supplies and
telephone) and medical care and treatment.
</p><p>
LAW asks the International community to intervene to take measures to
stop Israel's on going and escalating violations of international
human rights and humanitarian law, and to urgently intervene before
the humanitarian crisis deepens within the Occupied Palestinian
territories.

<b>Terror and Innocence</b>
<p>
When 9-year old Ubay Darraj was killed last Friday, he was playing 
in
his bedroom, under the protection of his 'home'. Ubay was hit in the
chest by heavy machinegun bullets fired from Israeli army posts
guarding the outskirts of Psagot settlement near Al-Bireh; he was 
dead
upon arrival at Ramallah hospital.
</p><p>
Mohammad Hilles, a 13-year old boy from Al- Shajaiyi, was shot in 
the
head while crossing Al-Mintar junction east of Gaza on February 27th;
he died of his wounds a few days later, on the same day as Ubay.
</p><p>
Aida Daoud Musa, 43 years old, was killed by a 5 mm. high velocity
bullet fired from Psagot settlement. Aida was walking near Friends
School in Al-Bireh with her son and daughter, she was buying presents
for her children a day before Al-Adha festivals. Aida was killed
immediately, her daughter, Nadil, was wounded in her left arm.
</p><p>
24-year old Abdelkareem Abu Asba was caught in clashes outside
Qalandia refugee camp. According to his father, he was on his way to a
nearby shop to get milk and biscuits for his daughter. Abdelkareem was
killed instantly when Israeli soldiers opened fire.
</p><p>
Even a mentally disabled 42-year old man, Mustafa Al-Ramlawi, was shot
and killed at Netzarim junction when Israeli soldiers "suspected" that
he was preparing to set off a bomb. Mustafa was shot from a distance
of 100 meters with heavy machineguns. Later, Israeli army sources
confirmed that the incident was a tragic mistake. It was a tragic
mistake.
</p><p>
As the Intifada enters its 6th consecutive month, the Palestinian
people find themselves desperately in need of 'protection'. The danger
is unavoidable, the horror of getting killed, or even injured, is
starring the Palestinian people (all Palestinian people) straight in
the face.
</p><p>
With Barak's unleashing of power 5 months ago, Sharon's determination
to guarantee "peace and SECURITY," and more recently, Mofaz's war
mongering and urge to use more stringent measures against the
Palestinians, life in the Palestinian territories has become a theatre
for bloodthirsty Israeli army generals, whose total disregard for
innocent Palestinian lives is a crime against humanity in itself.
</p><p>
The international community has a moral, political, and legal
obligation to intervene and stop the ongoing massacres that are being
committed by Israel against the Palestinian people. The total number
of Palestinians killed since late September 2000 has exceeded 400,
almost 50% of which are children below the age of 18. The total number
of casualties is almost 12,000, some with critical and irrecoverable
injuries.
</p><p>
The Palestinian people need protection; the Palestinian people deserve
protection.

<b>Israeli Siege Intensified</b>

<p>
Israeli authorities have intensified the multiple
siege imposed on Palestinian towns and villages across the West 
Bank.
Late last night, Israeli soldiers cut off the main road connecting the
West Bank town of Bir Zeit from nearby Ramallah, by digging a 100
meter long army bunker across the small village of Surda (between
Ramallah and Bir Zeit), causing a complete shut down of water access
to neighboring villages and cutting off all telephone lines.
</p><p>
Similar measures were taken last night in the northern West Bank towns
of Tukarem and Qalqilia. Israeli authorities have blocked the main
entrances to these towns with dirt barriers, causing a complete
isolation of its residents from the rest of the West Bank. In Jericho,
Israeli soldiers carried out similar measures; trenches, road
barriers, and a complete military closure on the Palestinian-ruled
part of the city.
</p><p>
On the southern outskirts of Ramallah, Rafat village has been cut off
for 9 consecutive days. Israeli forces have also imposed daily curfews
on Rafat, leaving dozens of its residents trapped in Ramallah and
other neighboring towns.
</p><p>
Israel's multiple-siege policy has had detrimental effects on the
economic and social lives of the Palestinian people over the past 5
months. Most Palestinian towns and villages are completely isolated,
and are suffering from a serious shortage in food supplies, medicine,
as well as vital services.
</p><p>
The closures are strangling a population of 2.8 million Palestinians.
The economic impact of the multiple siege are grave; the Palestinians
are losing a total of US$ 6.8 million per day due to the ongoing
closures, and there is a 50% decline in Palestinian GNP since
September 2000.
</p><p>
The humanitarian, political, and legal dimensions of the
Israeli-imposed siege on the Palestinian territories is a blatant
violation to the most basic Palestinian human and civil rights;
Israel's mass imprisonment of an entire population is an intolerable
and discriminatory measure that must end immediately.
</p></font><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
The Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of Global Dialogue and
Democracy (MIFTAH) urges the international community to condemn
Israel's policy of 'collective punishment', and to take immediate and
concrete measures to end the ongoing siege on the Palestinian
territories.
