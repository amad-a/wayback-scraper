<h3>PCHR</h3>

<b>The Israeli occupation forces continue to kill Palestinian civilians: Two children 
of Gaza and two youths of Hebron are killed today </b> 
<p>Since the morning, Palestinians have demonstrated throughout 
  the occupied Palestinian territories in protest to the killings and criminal 
  acts perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces against Palestinian civilians. 
  </p><p>The Israeli occupation forces have continued to reinforce their presence in 
  the occupied Palestinian territories with more troops and vehicles. They have 
  established new military sites. The number of martyrs killed by the Israeli 
  occupation forces has so far increased to 116, including 31 children under 18, 
  and more than 3,200, more than one third of whom are children, have been wounded. 
  </p><p>This morning, the Israeli occupation forces opened fire on some children and 
  boys who demonstrated near an Israeli military site in the area of Erez in the 
  northern part of the Gaza Strip. The child Wae'l Mhmoud Emad, 13 years, was 
  killed by the Israeli occupation forces. He received a rubber-coated metal bullet 
  in the head from a 20- meter distance or less. Medical sources of Shifa' hospital 
  in Gaza stated that a rubber-coated metal bullet penetrated the child's forehead 
  and settled in his head. PCHR's field officer in the mentioned area reported 
  that 4 boys were wounded by live ammunition and 11 were wounded by rubber-coated 
  metal bullets. He added that dozens of boys were hurt due to inhaling tear gas 
  which was used intensively by the Israeli occupation forces. In the vicinity 
  of the settlement of Kfar Darom, the Israeli occupation forces opened fire on 
  some boys demonstrated in the area. As a result the child Salah Fawzi Nejem, 
  15 years, from the refugee camp of Al-Maghazi was killed by a bullet in the 
  heart, 5 were wounded by live ammunition and one by rubber-coated metal bullets. 
  </p><p>PCHR reported that the Israeli occupation forces placed a roadblock this afternoon 
  on the main road linking between the north and south of the Gaza Strip (Salah 
  El-Din Street), 20m away from a roadblock of the Palestinian security forces 
  to the south of the settlement of Kfar Darom. He added that a tank and a military 
  jeep of the Israeli occupation forces were at the roadblock, and Israeli soldiers 
  were stopping and checking cars coming from the south towards Gaza city. It 
  is worth mentioning that such a roadblock is the first of its kind since the 
  redeployment of the Israeli occupation forces under the Interim Agreement in 
  May 1994.

</p><p> In Khan Yunis, 11 boys were wounded today by live ammunition and 13 
  were wounded by rubber-coated metal bullets fired by the Israeli occupation 
  forces at some boys demonstrated near an Israeli military outpost to the west 
  of the refugee camp of Khan Yunis. Additionally, dozens of children and boys 
  were hurt due to inhaling tear gas used by these forces. PCHR's field officer 
  in Khan Yunis reported that the Israeli occupation forces reinforced their presence 
  in the area establishing a new military outpost 200 meters away to the east 
  of a military roadblock of the Israeli occupation forces at the entrance of 
  the eastern road between Salah El-Din Street and the borders (Kissufim crossing). 
  Armored vehicles were also seen along the road between Al-Salqa valley and Al-Qarara 
  to the east of Deir El-Balah. In Hebrom, clashes broke out this afternoon between 
  Palestinian demonstrators and the Israeli occupation forces centered in the 
  northern area of the city. The Israeli occupation forces responded firing live 
  ammunition at demonstrators. As a result, Nae'l Ali Al-Zama'reh, 25 years, was 
  killed by a bullet in the chest, and 5 were wounded by live ammunition fired 
  by the Israeli occupation forces. Other clashes broke out in Hebron after escorting 
  the child Majed Al-Hawamdeh, from the village of Al-Sammou', who was killed 
  yesterday in clashes at the northern entrance of Al-Bireh, to his final resting 
  - place. 

</p><p>The Israeli occupation forces opened fire on the Palestinians who demonstrated 
  after the funeral and killed Emad Ismail Al-Hawamdeh, 23 years, from the village 
  of Al-Sammou' by a bullet in the heart. PCHR reiterates its call upon the international 
  community and the High Contracting Parties to Geneva Fourth Convention for immediate 
  interventions to stop the killings and criminal acts perpetrated by the Israeli 
  occupation forces against Palestinian civilians. PCHR calls for immediate providing 
  international protection for Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories, 
  as it is the only way to prevent more deterioration of the situation. "End"

Israel Kills another Boy</b>




<p>Israeli Troops Kills Three Today, One Boy of 13 22 October 2000 4:30 pm + 2 
  GMT Today, 22 October 2000, Israeli forces have killed three Palestinians in 
  the occupied Palestinian territory. Nael Al Zamara, aged 25 years, from Halhoul 
  was killed by a bullet to the chest during clashes in the West Bank. Imad Hawamdah, 
  aged 23 years, from Assumua village near Hebron was shot in the heart by live 
  ammunition. Wa'el Al Nasheet, a 13 year old boy, from Jabalia refugee camp was 
  shot in the head by a rubber coated metal bullet during near Erez checkpoint 
  in the Gaza Strip.
</p><p> The killings are being investigated but the evidence is that Israeli forces 
  used disproportionate and excessive force in a manner intended to kill. The 
  recent deaths bring the Palestinian death toll to 116, 35 are children. LAW 
  is pursuing the following: 
</p><p>* The Israeli government is made responsible for the violence committed against 
  Palestinian civilians.
</p><p> * Those responsible for this act are investigated and brought to trial.
</p><p> * Immediate action is taken to protect Palestinians civilians and force Israel 
  to comply with articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention.

<h3>Al Mezan</h3>
<b> The Massacre Continues: The Israeli Occupation Forces Killed 118 and Injured 
6000 Palestinians</b> 
<p> For the 23rd consecutive day, the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces continue 
  the aggression against the Palestinian civilians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
  In this context, the Israelis continued to use a full range weaponry in a, noticeably, 
  excessive manner against the unarmed Palestinians. 
</p><p>During the last 24 hours, yesterday and this mourning, the belligerent Israeli 
  Occupation Forces, killed at least 5 Palestinians and injured tens others. 
</p><p>The Palestinian martyrs were: 
</p><p> 1 Omar Ismail Albhaisi 21/10 16 Deir- Albalah Head injury.
</p><p> 2 Faiz Husein Alqaimari 21/10 33 Hebron Head injury. 
</p><p>3 Tariq Ismail Abd- Arrahman Alhantouli 21/10 22 Silet Aldahir/ Jenin Back 
  injury by 2 bullets.
</p><p>4 Majid Ibrahim Hauamdah 21/10 16 Al-Tireh/ Ramallah Head injury. 
</p><p>5 Wail Imad Annashit 22/10 14 Jabalya Head injury.
</p><p> The total number of Palestinians killed by the Israeli soldiers and settlers 
  reaches 118 and the number of injured is higher than 6000. The continuing state 
  of silence demonstrated by the international community encourages the Israelis 
  to continue their aggression against the Palestinians; something they seem very 
  persistent to perform. In light of all of this, AL-MEZAN Center for Human Rights 
  perceives the state of silence of the international community in regard to what 
  is happening in the Occupied Palestinian Territories highly dangerous. 
</p><p>AL-MEZAN also emphasizes what was mentioned in its previous releases that the 
  international community must immediately intervene to end the evident Israeli 
  grave breaches to the international humanitarian law, especially the 4th Geneva 
  Convention. The international community is also requested to provide protection 
  for the Palestinian civilians and present the Israeli war criminals before trial 
  as soon as possible. </p><p align="right"><a href="/addameer.org/september2000/pressreleases/#top" style="">back to top</a>

<h3>Socialist Party USA</h3>
<b> Statement on Middle East Violence </b> 
<p> The new wave of bloodshed in the Middle East has its starting point in Israel's 
  occupation of Palestinian lands. There can be no peace without justice, and 
  the Oslo Accords are inherently unjust. 
</p><p>The Socialist Party supports a just peace in the Middle East, based at a minimum 
  on fill enforcement of the Geneva Conventions, an end to the occupation of the 
  West Bank and Gaza, and equal rights for all Israeli citizens. We support the 
  institution of a truly independent Palestinian state. 
</p><p>The Socialist Party calls for the immediate cessation of all aid to Israel, 
  including the sale of military equipment of any kind. U.S. aid has been used 
  by Israel to fashion one of the most powerful military machines in the world. 
  The U.S. government's complicity with the Israeli occupations should end now.
