<b>The election of Ariel Sharon: more of the same?
</b>


<p>
The victory of Ariel Sharon in the elections for Israeli Prime

Minister on 6 February has cast yet another dark cloud over the

chances for peace in the Middle East. The election of a man with 
such

a violent, reckless and bloody past will do nothing to encourage a

climate of trust between Israelis and Palestinians. 

</p><p>
The Council remains extremely concerned about the safety and 
security

of Palestinians both in the Occupied Territories and inside Israel.

Nearly 350 Palestinians have been killed since 28 September 
2000, and

over 11,000 injured and the likelihood is that Mr Sharon will continue

Ehud Barak's policy of using lethal force against Palestinians. 

Without an improvement in their living conditions, without lifting the

closures, curfews, blockades, roadblocks, there will be no end to this

sorry cycle of violence. Security for Israelis must not used as a

smokescreen for further repression and escalation of the conflict.

Security will come from genuine efforts to live in peace and

co-existence. Similarly, tensions between the Jewish and Arab citizens

of Israel will only recede once the Israeli government ends its

discrimination against its non-Jewish minority.

</p><p>
Chances for peace must also not be eroded by further expansion of

settlements and confiscation of Palestinian land.  Both the Labour and

Likud parties have proved themselves to be champion settlement

builders, and the sheer absence of international and especially

British criticism of this is extremely worrying. A freeze on

settlement expansion is an immediate necessity, regardless of who is

in power in Israel.
</p><p>

The Council reiterates its call to the international community to live

up to its legal and moral obligations to protect the 2.5 million

Palestinians living under military occupation, whilst implementing UN

Resolutions. A failure to act and demonstrate that Israel is not above

the law could have massive repercussions for the entire region.
