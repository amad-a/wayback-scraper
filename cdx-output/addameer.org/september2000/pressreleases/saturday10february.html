<b>Israeli Shelling of Palestinian Residential Areas Escalates:
Al-haq Calls For Immediate International Intervention to 
Protect Palestinian Civilians</b>


<p>For the second successive day the Israeli occupying forces 
continued its heavy shelling of Palestinian civilian areas in cities of 
the West Bank and Gaza.On 8 February 2001, the al- Jinan 
neighborhood and Satih Marhaba in El Bira were shelled for six 
continuous hours. Yesterday night the same areas were shelled 
for four hours. Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinian houses 
located opposite the Pisgat Zve settlement using heavy machine 
guns. One house caught fire and was completely destroyed and 
another ten houses were damaged. The offices of the Palestinian 
Red Crescent Society were hit by several shells and caught fire 
causing extensive damage to the upper floors of the building. A 
PRCS vehicle used to transport disabled students was also 
damaged. Emergency telephone lines were damaged, preventing 
PRCS from receiving calls for aid. The al-Haya al-Jadida 
newspaper’s building was also shelled. Windows were broken 
and internal walls, computers, and other office equipment was 
damaged.
</p><p>
Al-Haq views with grave concern the Israeli Occupying Forces 
continued use of excessive force as demonstrated by their use of 
tanks and heavy machine guns against civilian homes and 
property.Twenty-four Palestinians have been killed since the 
outbreak of the present Intifada as a result of these actions.
</p><p>
1. Al-Haq demands that States Parties to the Fourth Geneva 
Convention of 1949 move to intervene by pressuring Israel to 
force it to abide by the convention and implement the convention 
as it applies to the Occupied Territories. The international 
Community must demand that Israel stop its shelling of civilian 
areas, which violate provisions of International Humanitarian Law, 
specifically Articles 32, 33, and 147 of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilians During Times of 
Conflict. Israeli actions also violate Articles 22, 23, and 25 of the 
1907 Hague Convention.
</p><p>
2. The Security Council should take immediate action to provide a 
protection force for Palestine that can act to stop Israeli 
aggression and prevent further human rights violations, including 
the shelling of civilian areas. Such actions constitute a direct 
threat to the civilian Palestinian population.
</p></font><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
3. The international community should fulfill their responsibilities in 
accordance with UN resolution 377 by placing pressure upon the 
UN to provide a protection force

<b>Israeli Occupation Forces Torture Palestinian Women Prisoners
and Place Them Under Solitary Confinement</b>



<p>
The oppressive and terrorizing practices that the Israeli Occupation
Forces (IOF) are perpetrating against Palestinian prisoners are
escalating.  Since the beginning of the current Palestinian uprising
(Intifada), the IOF has placed five Palestinian women political
prisoners under solitary confinement, humiliating "security" 
measures
and degrading imprisonment conditions.  Furthermore, the women's
families are forbidden from visiting them, which adds to their
torture, sense of isolation and deteriorating psychological
situations.
</p><p>
We, in the Women's Affairs Technical Committee in Palestine, 
assert
our solidarity with these women political prisoners.  We appeal to the
international community, all human rights institutions and defenders
of justice around the world to intervene for the immediate release of
the five Palestinian women political prisoners. Moreover, we call upon
our Palestinian people and the Arab masses worldwide to join us in our
demand for the immediate release by the IOF of the five Palestinian
women Political prisoners.  We will not rest until these women's
voices are heard around the world, and until justice prevails.

The five Palestinian women political prisoners are:
</p><p>      Suna Mahmoud Ar-Ra'I from Qalqilya who was arrested at her
return from Jordan on Aril 12, 1997 </p><p>      Suad Hilmi Ghazal, 17 years
old from Sabastia in the suburbs of Nablus who was arrested on
December 13, 1998 and sentenced six years </p><p>     Nisreen Ya'coub Taha
from the village in Bidya, Salfeet, who was arrested on March 25, 1998
</p><p>    Maha Ibrahim Al'ikk from Bethlehem arrested on August 2, 2000 </p><p>
     Amneh  Jawad Muna from Bir-nabala in the suburbs of Jerusalem
arrested on January 24,2001
