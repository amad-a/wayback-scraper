<b>Human Rights Organisations Call for Expelling Israel from the 
United

Nations</b>
<p>
The Third International Conference of the Human Rights Movement 
in the

Arab World called upon the League of Arab States to take the 
practical

measures necessary for expelling Israel from the United Nations. 
This

is based on Israel's violation of one of the conditions for accepting

its membership to the UN in 1949, that is its failure to implement 
the

UN Resolution 194 of 1948 that requires it to allow the return of the

Palestinian refugees to their homes and to pay compensations.

</p><p>
This was part of the recommendations of the Rabat Declaration on the

Rights of the Palestinian Refugees. The Rabat Declaration was adopted

by the conference organised by the Cairo Institute for Human Rights,

in coordination with the Moroccan Organisation for Human Rights and

the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network, from 10 to 12 February

2001 in Rabat, Morocco.
</p><p>

The conference started with keynote addresses by Mr. Muhammad Ugar,

the Moroccan Minister for Human Rights, and the representatives of the

organisers. The inaugural session was chaired by Mr. Khaled

el-Nassery, Chairman of the Arab League's Permanent Committee for

Human Rights. The conference was attended by human rights

organisations from 7 Arab countries and from Palestine of 1948, Arab

and foreign experts, academics, jurists, officials, in addition to

representatives of international human rights organisations, the

United Nations, and Arab and foreign diplomats.

</p><p>
The conference discussed 13 papers on five themes. Four major

international human rights organisations gave statements on their

positions on the Palestinian refugees issue. They were: Amnesty

International, The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network, The

International Federation for Human Rights, and Human Rights Watch.
</p><p>
In its closing session, the Conference discussed the Rabat Declaration

(attached) setting out the main recommendation. Moreover, the

conference mad e three practical recommendations:
</p><p>

1- Charging the CIHRS with submitting the conference's recommendations

as embodied in the Rabat Declaration to: the Secretary General of the

Arab League, for presentation to the next Arab summit in March in

Amman; the Secretary General of the United Nations; the United Nations

High Commissioner for Human Rights; the United Nations Human Rights

Commission; Sweden, in its capacity as the president of the European

Union during this period; and the international human rights

organisation.

</p><p>
2- Calling upon the Palestinian organisations in the West Bank, Gaza

and Palestine of 1948, to follow up the conference's recommendations,

in coordination with the Arab networks in Europe and the United States

concerned with the implementation of the right of return.

</p></font><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
3- Calling upon the (Badil) Resource Centre for Palestinian Residency

and Refugee Rights, Jerusalem, to continue its work for documenting

all the information and documents pertaining to the refugees, in

cooperation with the concerned organisations and networks.

<b>Red Cross Medical Supplies Denied Entry to Gaza  </b>

</font><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A shipment of emergency medical supplies was denied entry into 
Gaza
today by the Israeli Army. After days of increased conflict, the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) attempted to 
deliver
the badly needed medical items for the Palestine Red Crescent 
Society
Emergency Medical and Ambulance Services, but their truck was 
turned
back at the Erez Checkpoint. PRCS views this breach of 
humanitarian
international humanitarian law with grave concern. We ask our
partners, national red cross/crescent societies, NGOs, and world
governments to intervene with the Israeli authorities to permit the
delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need.
