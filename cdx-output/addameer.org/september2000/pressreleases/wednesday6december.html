<p><b>  JOURNALISTS ACCOMPANYING UN SPECIAL ENVOY
DENIED ACCESS TO H-2
    AREA IN
HEBRON </b></p>


<p>This morning, during the visit of UN Special Envoy Terje Roed-
Larsen,
the Israeli army prevented Palestinian journalists from entering the
H2 area in Hebron, which is still under direct Israeli control.
Palestinian journalists could not access the neighbourhoods of
Jabal
Jowhar and   the area around Usama Bin Munkhez primary school
for
boys, which the Israeli army converted into a military basis two
months ago. Nasser Sheijuhi, the Hebron correspondent and
photographer
of Associated Press, was reportedly beaten up and pushed to the
ground
by IDF soldiers. Subsequently, he was arrested and taken to the
Kiryat
Arba settlement for interrogation. In addition, Palestinian residents
who wanted to explain their current situation were not allowed to
approach Mr Roed-Larsen.
</p><p>
Workers at Palestinian Telecommunication told LAW that last night
settlers from the Abraham Avino settlement, in the middle of Hebron,
destroyed telephone lines owned by the company. As a consequence,
about 1000 phone lines were disconnected in the Old City, in the
Zahada neighbourhood and the municipality area.
</p><p>
For the past two months, between 30-40,000 Palestinians, living in H-2
area of Hebron, have been under curfew. This measure has been taken by
the Israeli security forces under the pretext that it is necessary in
order to ensure the safety of 400 Israeli settlers living in the
middle of Hebron.
</p><p>
In the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers positioned at Salah-a-Din Gate in
Rafah fired live ammunition at a group of young Palestinians. Salim
Muhammad Hamaida (13) from Rafah was hit in the head and is in
critical condition at Shiffa hospital.
</p><p>
In Tal Zara’ab (Rafah) the Israeli army, using heavy ammunition, shot
at houses from a distance of 200 meters, damaging the walls of houses
of shops.
</p><p>
Moreover, at 6 p.m. this evening, an Israeli military naval vessel
fired at 18-year-old Jamil Kamal as he was fishing along the coast
near Mwasi Rafah. He was hit with two bullets in the leg.
</p><p>
LAW condemns the curfew imposed on Palestinian residents of Hebron for
the sake of a small group of Israeli settlers, who are an illegal
presence. Israel established and maintains settlements in the Occupied
Palestinian Territories in flagrant violation of international
humanitarian law.
</p><p>
LAW calls on the Israeli authorities to enable all journalists to work
without being subject to restrictions of movement, pressure and
harassment
</p></font><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
LAW urges the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 242,
prohibiting the acquisition of territory by force, and calling for the
Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territories.

<p><b> SPECIAL REPORT ON THE ISRAELI MEIDA:
ISRAELI MEDIA INCITES AND ENCOURAGES
ISRAELI POLITICAL AND MILITARY OFFICIALS   TO CONTINUE
ITS ACTIONS
TOWARDS PALESTINIANS DECEMBER 6, 2000</b></p>





<p>Law and the I’lam Center, basing their conclusions on the report
written and edited by writer and journalist Mr. Salman Natoor, state
that that the Israeli media especially, radio and television
encourages the Israeli government and the military to continue its
siege on Palestinian civilians.

</p><p>Mr. Salman’s report included excerpts of radio and television
broadcasts, news articles and reports from the last week of October
and the beginning of November 2000 that were gathered by a group
of
Arab-Palestinian media professionals in Israel. The conclusions are
as
follows:

</p><p>
1. Journalists, military and political reporters and commentators on
Arab issues became the spokespeople for the Israeli governmental and
military system.
</p><p>
2. The Israeli television broadcast footage mainly from the Israeli
point of view and when footage was broadcast from Palestinian
television it was described as “Palestinian propaganda.”  In contrast,
the IDF and Israeli government spokesmen were given leeway to fully
comment on events and when they were called upon to explain that over
a 150 Palestinians had been killed, they were unable to do so.
</p><p>
3. In interviews with Palestinians, the Israeli interviewers showed no
sense of balance between the Palestinian and Israeli sides. In most
cases the interviewers were aggressive and patronizing towards the
Palestinians interviewees. In the report there are examples of this.
</p><p>
4. In most Israeli media reports, the Palestinian victims remained
only numbers, no families or mothers. Palestinian property had no
value and the homes of Palestinian citizens turned were described as “
positions of the Tanzim.” Additionally, numerous Israeli reporters and
hosts presented Arafat’s as a Nazi. In an interview in the program
“Seven and a Half” on channel One on Israeli Television, journalist
Uri Dan called the children of the Intifada
 “ Arafat’s Yogen” comparing them to Hitler’s Yogen. Dan repeated this
expression three times without any reaction from the other
interviewees.
</p><p>
5. “Arafat is using terror again.” This is the picture that is
revealed in the Israeli media. The violence always begins on the
Palestinian side. The Israeli violence including settler violence is
not described as terror or violence against citizens.
</p><p>
6. The Israeli soldier is represented as the party who gets attacked.
Israeli shootings and bombing are justified as retaliation and
self-defence. Furthermore, when innocent citizens are killed they are
rendered irrelevant by Israeli media.  For example, two women were
killed during assassination of Hussein Abeiyat from the Tanzim
however, their deaths were reported as marginal.
</p><p>
7.  At times, media reports on the current situation were not
thoroughly investigated. For example, journalists report that the
Tanzim use ambulances from which to shoot at soldiers,
 “ Arafat smuggles ammunitions in his airplane” and Palestinian
 mothers send
their children to confront the soldiers.
</p><p>
8. Most of the reporters and commentators, especially the ones from
Israeli television reported what Arafat would “ think, intend and
want” and not what he actually said or did. They mention the aims of
Arafat and the Palestinian leadership and undeclared intentions as
true facts, like for example,  the statements that shooting from
Christian houses in Bethlehem is intentional in order to get the
Israeli military to retaliate and fire on churches in the hope that it
would awaken the Christian public to Israel’s actions.
</p><p>
9. The Israeli media never questioned the military’s policy of
“containment” even while more than 100 Palestinians had been killed
and more than 6,000 were injured in the first month of the events and
towns had been bombed and shelled by Israeli helicopters and tanks.
</p><p>
10. The Israeli media also took part in the incitement against the
Palestinian officials especially the Arab members of Knesset, whom
they blamed for igniting the disturbances in the Arab street. It was a
month and a half later when a report was published describing how 13
Palestinian- Israeli citizens were killed.
</p><p>
11. The Israeli media further ignored combined Jewish and Arab actions
against the Israeli occupation, while they widely covered
demonstrations by settlers.
