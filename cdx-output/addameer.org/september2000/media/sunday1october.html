<a name="1"><h3>   Militants call Palestinians to arms after killings by Israel 
(AFP)</h3></a>

<p>
    GAZA CITY, Oct 1 (AFP) - Islamist militants called on 
the
Palestinians Sunday to step up violence in a holy war against 
Israel,
after Israeli forces killed more than 20 Palestinians in 
clashes.
</p>
<p>
    "Only jihad (holy war) can preserve the holy sites of 
Al-Qods
(Jerusalem)," said Islamic Jihad, which called on Yasser 
Arafat's
Palestinian Authority to cut off negotiations with Israel.
</p>
<p>
   
Hamas, responsible for numerous anti-Israeli attacks since the
1993 Oslo 
accords between the Palestinians and Israel, declared a
general strike 
Monday "to defend Al-Aqsa," the mosque in Jerusalem
around which seven 
Palestinians died Friday in clashes with Israeli
forces.
</p>
<p>
    
Hamas also called for "an increase in resistance against 
Israeli
soldiers."
</p>
<p>
    "We invite our people to take up anew the arms of the 
Intifada
like rocks, slings, Molotov cocktails and knives," Hamas said 
in a
statement referring to the Palestinian uprising of the 
1980s.
</p>
<p>
    The clashes with Israeli soldiers mark the beginning of "a 
new
holy war," Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghosheh said earlier on 
Iranian
radio.
</p>
<p>
    "The clashes are going to increase and it has now been 
shown that
the Palestinians will never accept the Zionist enemies' 
domination
over the Al-Aqsa Mosque and Palestinian land," Ghosheh 
said.
</p>
    <p>
Ghosheh, speaking from an unspecified location, also called 
on
"all Muslim and Arab countries to come to the side of the 
Palestinian
Muslims, in their holy war for Al-Qods."</p>

<p>
  Twenty-nine 
Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli
forces since Thursday, 
when right-wing Israeli opposition leader
Ariel Sharon visited the 
Jerusalem mosque compound, a site sacred to
Jews as well as Muslims and the 
most bitterly contested spot in the
Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict.</p>

<a name="2"><h3> Palestinians bear brunt of Israeli bullets 
(Reuters)
</h3></a>
   
<p>
 JERUSALEM, Oct 1 (Reuters) - "Beware of dying a 
natural
death," said the posters plastered along the alleys of
Jerusalem's Old 
City announcing the death of Osama Jedda.
</p>
<p>
    "Do not die but 
in a volley of gunfire."
</p>
<p>
    As violence between Palestinians 
and Israeli soldiers flared
 for a fourth day on Sunday, it seemed a 
fitting eulogy for the
youth whose family now calls him a martyr as one of 
19
Palestinians killed in the clashes.
</p>
<p>
    As the bloodiest 
violence since 1996 between Palestinians
and Israeli soldiers raged, 
Jedda's family held a wake in his
memory next to Al-Aqsa mosque, one of 
Islam's holiest sites.
</p>
<p>
    "As a Palestinian he always dreamt 
about independence in his
own country," said Osama's uncle Mahmoud Jidda, 
as mourners
gathered inside the old stone hall beneath black flags 
and
pictures of the slender, dark 23-year old youth.
</p>
<p>
    His face 
contorted with efforts to restrain his emotion,
Osama's father, his 
head wrapped in an Arab shawl, received
queues of mourners who kissed him 
on both cheeks.
</p>
<p>
    Grim-faced helpers circulated with trays 
of coffee and dates
to refresh the men who came to call, sitting quietly 
in a circle
as recorded Koran prayers resounded from 
loudspeakers.
</p>
<p>
    "Our message on the posters was that you don't just live 
to
die. You have to have a cause," said Mahmoud.
</p>

<p>
    The Old City 
swarmed with Israeli soldiers for the fourth
day since violence erupted 
on Thursday after a visit by
right-wing Israeli leader Ariel Sharon to 
al-Aqsa.
</p>
<p>
    On the roof above the wake, five soldiers took up 
positions,
presumably in case of any violence. The Arab family on 
whose
roof they were staked out screamed in vain at them to leave.
</p>
<p>
    
Emotions were high for the fourth day as Palestinians
hurling stones 
and petrol bombs squared off with Israeli
soldiers fighting with live 
ammunition and rubber-coated metal
bullets throughout the West Bank and 
Gaza.
</p>
<p>
    The violence in Jerusalem, Nablus, Ramallah, Hebron, 
and
Bethlehem made a mockery of peace efforts between Israel and 
the
Palestinians, whose negotiators last week were trying to 
bridge
differences to reach a final peace deal.
</p>
<p>
    When history is written 
about the path to any peace deal, it
is unlikely that the names of Khalid 
Warasna, Azam Abdin or
Hussein Othman will figure. But they have 
paid.
</p>
<p>
    At Mukassad hospital in Arab East Jerusalem, Warasna lay 
in
bed mumbling incoherently, as doctors displayed x-rays they 
said
showed where a high-velocity bullet pierced his abdomen and
fragmented 
internally, hitting his internal organs.
</p>
<p>
    Abdin, one socket 
purple and swollen to the size of a golf
ball, was blinded in his right 
eye when a rubber bullet
fractured his skull, damaging an optic 
nerve.
</p>
<p>
    Othman lost his left eye to a rubber bullet. His 
family
sobbed into handkerchiefs at his bedside as he lay shaking.
</p>
<p>
Nearly 
700 Palestinians have been wounded in four days.
</p>
<p>
    Two 
Israeli soldiers have been killed and dozens hurt.
</p>
<p>
    Up the 
street from Mukassad at Augusta Victoria Hospital,
Israeli soldiers sat 
idly, slicing tomatoes for lunch as
Palestinians rode by on camels and 
donkeys before noon. The
streets were littered with debris from past street 
clashes -
chunks of concrete, bottles, spent bullet casings.
</p>
<p>
    
Rudolf Hinz, a director affiliated with the hospital, tried
to get the 
soldiers to leave before violence started.
</p>
<p>
    "What we found 
on our property was not just rubber bullets
and tear gas, but live 
ammunition. They use this kind of
inappropriate retaliation against youths 
who throw stones," he
said. "We feel they attract 
aggressiveness."
</p>
<p>
    Hours later, the Israelis were on their feet, squeezing 
off
tear gas rounds at Palestinian stone-throwers.
</p>
   <p>
 "I'm really 
shocked by what I've seen, the use of live
ammunition and high-velocity 
bullets which explode in the body,"
said European Parliament member 
Joost Lagendijk, who toured
hospitals. "This is not a usual place."</p>

<p>    Gaza (AP) - Israeli

according to Palestinian

<a name="4"><h3>Palestinians, Israelis stage 
gun battles in West Bank, Gaza Strip (AP)
</h3></a>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP) 
-- Palestinians waged running gunbattles with
 Israeli troops Sunday, 
including a shootout near an Israeli enclave
in a West Bank town that 
helped push the three-day casualty toll to
23 dead and 700 
wounded.
</p>
<p>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader 
Yasser
Arafat tried, but failed, to ease tensions in a Saturday night
phone 
conversation, and clashes resumed Sunday in the worst
Arab-Israeli 
violence in four years.
</p>
<p>
   Rooftop gunmen, crouching behind a wall, 
fired automatic rifles
at Israeli forces from a house less than 200 
yards from Joseph's
Tomb, a tiny Israeli enclave in the Palestinian town 
of Nablus in
the West Bank.
</p>
<p>
   At least 10 armed Palestinians 
took part in the firefight, and
other demonstrators lobbed firebombs 
that set ablaze Israeli tents
in the enclave. One Palestinian policemen 
was killed and at least
seven Palestinians were injured, according to 
doctors.
</p>
<p>
   The tomb houses what some believe to be the burial 
place of the
biblical figure Joseph, holy to Jews and Muslims alike. It 
was also
the scene of ferocious firefights in 1996, the last major 
outburst
of fighting between Palestinians and Israelis.
</p>
<p>
   In a 
second shooting, Palestinians and Israelis exchanged heavy
fire at an army 
post near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim in the
Gaza Strip. About a 
dozen Palestinians, both in uniform and
civilian dress, brandished 
assault rifles, while hundreds more
Palestinians threw stones at Israeli 
soldiers. Two Palestinians
were killed, hospital officials 
said.
</p>
<p>
   The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has traditionally focused on
their 
political dispute, but the current rioting also includes
emotional 
appeals to religious differences.
</p>
<p>
   The battles erupted after 
Israel's hard-line opposition leader,
Ariel Sharon, on Thursday visited a 
bitterly contested Jerusalem
religious shrine sacred to Muslims and 
Jews.
</p>
<p>
   "This is a war between religions and I'm participating 
because
I'm Muslim," said Khaled Abu Araish, a 25-year-old demonstrator 
in
Hebron.
</p>
<p>
   The violence has set back prospects for an 
Israeli-Palestinian
peace treaty, which were stalled even before the 
latest
confrontations.
</p>
<p>
   Sunday's clashes also spread to Israeli 
Arab towns, including
Nazareth. In the town of Jesus' boyhood, hundreds of 
youngsters,
many with their faces masked, threw stones at Israeli 
police who
fired a steady barrage of tear gas and rubber-coated steel 
bullets.
</p>
<p>
   The town's main road, which was blocked with burning 
tires, is
near the Basilica of the Annunciation built on the spot 
where
tradition says the Angel Gabriel foretold Jesus' birth.
</p>
   
Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian leaders traded sharp words.
  <p>
 "We have 
solid ground to believe that (the clashes) were in
great part 
orchestrated from above," said Shlomo Ben-Ami, Israel's
police minister, in a 
reference to the Palestinian leadership.
</p>
<p>
"Such a course is as 
dangerous as riding on the back of a tiger."
   Ahmed Qureia, speaker of 
the Palestinian parliament, called on
Israel to withdraw its troops, 
"because the troops represent a
point of friction, and a symbol for the 
continuation of the clashes
that took place in the past three 
days."
</p>
<p>
   Throughout the West Bank, shops and schools were closed 
as
Palestinians observed a general strike for a second day. The strike
spread 
to Arab Israeli communities inside Israel on Sunday in a
show of 
solidarity.
</p>
<p>
   Arab Israelis are sympathetic with Palestinian 
political
aspirations, though they didn't take part in the recent 
clashes.
But today there is a feeling of "great anger, great rage," said
Mohammed 
Barakeh, an Arab member of Israel's parliament.
</p>
<p>
   Palestinian 
officials on Sunday confirmed two additional deaths
from Saturday's 
clashes. One of the dead was Jihad Aloul, 20, the
son of Mahmoud Aloul, 
the governor of Nablus.
</p>
<p>
   A total of 23 Palestinians have been 
killed in three days of
rioting, and more than 700 injured, according 
to Palestinian
officials. Israel says 11 members of its security forces 
have been
wounded.
</p>
<p>
   In several tense areas, huge crowds 
gathered for the Sunday
funerals of Palestinians. Mourners carried the 
coffins through
packed streets, and Palestinian gunmen fired into the 
air.
</p>
<p>
   Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official, accused the 
Israelis
of using excessive force, saying this "is matched with a 
huge
number of casualties."
</p>
<p>
   Palestinians say the riots are a 
spontaneous response to
Sharon's visit to the disputed hilltop shrine known 
to Jews as the
Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, or Noble 
Sanctuary.
Sharon dismissed charges that he was to blame.
</p>
<p>
   
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are hung up because of rival
sovereignty 
claims to the shrine, which was once home to the
biblical Jewish 
Temple, Judaism's holiest site, and now houses two
major mosques that mark 
the spot where tradition says the Prophet
Muhammad ascended to 
heaven.
</p>
<p>
   The walled compound is the third holiest site of Islam. 
Neither
side wants the other to have full control. U.S. compromise
proposals 
have been rejected so far by the negotiators.
</p>
<p>
   The violence 
is the deadliest since September 1996, when 59
Palestinians, 16 
Israelis and three Egyptians were killed in three
days of gun battles.
</p>
 
<p>
  The latest clashes came as Israelis marked their two-day 
New
Year's holiday on Saturday and Sunday, a time of festive 
family
gatherings.</p>

<a name="5"> <h3>Arafat says war against Israel an "option" 
(AFP)</h3></a>

    <p>
RIYADH, Oct 1 (AFP) - Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 
warned in
an interview published Sunday by the Saudi newspaper Okaz that 
he was
ready to use "any option", including war, to face up to 
Israel.</p>

    <p>
"We are ready for any option that circumstances throw up 
(at
us)," Arafat said in a telephone interview Saturday from Cairo, 
where
he was meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.</p>

    
<p>
"We are always looking for peace, but if we are forced to 
defend
ourselves, we will not hesitate" to wage war, Arafat said.</p>

    <p>
"We are 
ready to defend ourselves at any moment," he stressed,
adding that "the 
Palestinian people have several options at their
disposal, and their 
history is full of sacrifices."</p>

   <p>
 On whether the peace process 
with Israel could be continued after
three days of violent clashes 
between Palestinians and Israeli
forces, Arafat said he was obliged to 
carry them through.</p>

    <p>
But he said the meetings sporadically 
organised between the two
sides since the collapse of July's 
Israeli-Palestinian peace summit
in Camp David were "not negotiations but simple 
contacts. Everyone
knows that it's simply contacts."</p>

<p>
    A visit 
Thursday by Israel's right-wing Likud leader Ariel Sharon
to the Al-Aqsa 
mosque compound in eastern Jerusalem triggered bloody
clashes that have 
left 27 Palestinians dead and some 700 injured in
Jerusalem, the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
<p align="RIGHT">[<a href="/addameer.org/september2000/media/#top" style="">top of

<a name="6"><h3>Fresh clashes in Gaza and the West 
Bank (AP)</h3>
</a>
   <p>
 Ramallah, West Bank (AP) - Fresh clashes 
between Palestinians
and Israeli security forces erupted Sunday in a 
fourth day of bloody
unrest that has swept the Palestinian 
territories.</p>

   <p>
 The violence claimed at least one more life on Sunday - 
a
Palestinian policeman shot dead by Israeli soldiers in Nablus - while
 two 
Palestinians died in hospital of gunshot wounds to their heads
after 
being declared clinically dead on Saturday.</p>

    <p>
More than 60 
people were injured in the new street fighting in
the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip on Sunday. The Nablus death brings to 23
the number of people 
killed in clashes over the past three days,
according to Palestinian Health 
Minister Riad Sanun.</p>

    <p>
The disturbances started in Jerusalem 
Thursday after a visit to
the disputed sacred site in Jerusalem, known 
as Temple Mount to
Israelis and Haram al-Sharif to Moslems, by 
rightwing Israeli Likud
leader Ariel Sharon.</p>

   <p>
 A total of more than 
600 people are believed to have been injured
in the clashes. The first 
seven fatalities came when the violence
escalated on Friday. The 
Israeli army has also said dozens of its men
have been injured.</p>

   <p>
 
Most of the dead were buried Sunday afternoon with Palestinians
turning 
out in large numbers for the funerals. Among the victims was
a 
12-year-old Palestinian boy who was caught in cross-fire between
Palestinian 
snipers and Israeli soldiers.</p>

    <p>
The incident prompted 
authorities to order the closure of all
Palestinian schools until Tuesday to 
keep schoolchildren away from
the street violence.</p>

   <p>
 The 
renewed unrest erupted Sunday immediately after the burials.
On Sunday 
morning demonstrators clashed with Israeli soldiers in the
West Bank city of 
Hebron.</p>

   <p>
 Sharon's visit has also been criticised as 
provocative by Arab
leaders. Jerusalem's holy sites have been a major 
stumbling block in
the ongoing peace talks.</p>

   <p>
 Israel says it will 
not give up sovereignty after its occupation
in 1967 while Palestinians 
say they will not accept any peace
solution that would not return Arab 
East Jerusalem, including
Al-Haram area, to their sovereignty.</p>

 
<p>
 The Arab League was due to convene for an emergency conference 
in
Cairo Sunday to discuss the situation. Arab League chief 
Esmat-Abdel
Meguid said after a meeting with Arafat in Cairo that the
organisation would 
discuss a unified stance of the Arab world in the
face of "Israel's 
violation of the holy sites in Jerusalem".</p>

<a name="7"><h3>Israeli FM 
denounces Palestinians over violence, calls for renewed peace talks 
(AFP)</h3></a>

<p>
TEL AVIV, Israel, Oct 1 (AFP) - Israel's acting Foreign 
Minister
Shlomo Ben Ami on Sunday blamed the Palestinian Authority for 
the
clashes that have killed 26 Palestinians over the past few days 
and
called on the authority to come to the negotiating table.</p>

<p>"We 
have solid ground to believe that in great part, the riots
were 
orchestrated from above," Ben Ami, also Israel's security
minister, told a 
press conference here.</p>

    <p>
"People in the Palestinian Authority 
thought this serves a
political purpose, maybe a public relations 
purpose," he said.</p>

    <p>
Referring to an appeal made by Israeli Prime 
Minister Ehud Barak
to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Saturday night 
to end to the
violence, Ben Ami regretted that "clear-cut instructions 
do not
percolate all the way down."</p>


    <p>
The minister defended 
Israel's use of force against the
demonstrators, saying that while 
"Arab citizens are entirely free to
demonstrate their feelings, it is our 
obligation to enforce law and
order."</p>

<p>
    Twenty-six 
Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more
injured in clashes since 
Thursday, when Israeli right-wing leader
Ariel Sharon visited Jerusalem's 
mosque compound, the most bitterly
contested site in the Israeli-Palestinian 
peace process.
</p>
<p>
    Ben Ami declined to denounce the visit by 
Sharon, an opponent of
his government, saying that the compound -- known 
to Jews as the
Temple Mount, their most sacred place -- was under 
Israeli
sovereignty.
</p>
<p>
   "I am not saying that his visit was 
helpful," Ben Ami said.
</p>
<p>
    But "Jerusalem is on the table. There is 
no need for violence to
show that it is an issue in the 
talks."
</p>
<p>
    Ben Ami, a head negotiator with the Palestinians, said 
a
long-awaited peace agreement "continues to be possible even today"
and appealed 
to the Palestinian Authority "to stop the violence and
to ensure that 
(its order) percolates down to the people."
</p>
<p>
    "My main 
message today is not to judge what happened but to
restart the negotiations,"

<a name="8"><h3>Two more Palestinians die in West Bank 
shootout (AFP)
</h3></a>
   <p>
 NABLUS, West Bank, Oct 1 (AFP) - Two 
Palestinians, including a
10-year-old boy, were killed during a shoot-out 
with Israeli forces
near a Jewish shrine in the West Bank town of Nablus 
on Sunday,
hospital sources said.</p>

   <p>
 Their deaths brought to 
five the number to die on Sunday, the
fourth day of bloody clashes and 
gunbattles raging across the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, and 29 since 
Friday.</p>

     <p>
The two dead were identified as Samr Samir Tabanja, 
10, who was
shot in the heart, and Hossam Bakhit, 18, from Balata 
refugee camp
near Nablus. They were hit during clashes near Joseph's Tomb, a 
site
revered by Jews.</p>

   <p>
 Earlier Sunday, a member of the 
Palestinian security forces was
shot dead in the same area.</p>

    <p>
In 
the Gaza Strip, another 10-year-old boy was declared
clinically dead 
after being hit by a live bullet in Rafah near the
border with Egypt, 
while a Palestinian man was killed in a gunbattle
near the Jewish 
settlement of Netzarim.</p>
