<b>The Mythic Past : Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel  - Thomas Thompson: </b></a> - Amazon.com writes,"One of the world's leading Biblical archaeologists concludes that the Old Testament offers absolutely no credible historical data on the early history of Israel. The Jewish people's historical claims to Israel, the small area bordering the eastern Mediterranean, is not only the foundation for the modern state of Israel, it also lies at the very heart of Judeo-Christian belief. This is the first comprehensive overview and synthesis of the latest archaeological research from the Middle East written for the general reader. Its often startling assertions will make for a powderkeg of a book. Among the author's conclusions are these: There never was a "united monarch" [Saul, David, Solomon] in history We can no longer talk about a time of the Patriarchs The entire notion of "Israel" and its history is a literary fiction."<b>Hardback - 1999, 425 pages.

<b>Unequal Conflict - John Gee: </b></a> - John Gee's 1998 book examines the war of 1948 and the reasons underlying the Palestinian defeat. Going beyond explanations based on the support of the Great powers for Zionism, Gee also looks at Palestinian society and the social factors which impaired Palestinian resistance to the Zionist enterprise.

<b>Day of the Long Night - Jamil Toubbeh: </b></a> - Amazon.com writes, "Toubbeh's thoughtful and penetrating essays bespeak a cultured and widely informed intellect... He offers his readers a rare perspective, dealing authoritatively with the societies of both his homeland and his adopted land, bringing a relevancy not only to recent history but also to current and evolving issues of importance to peoples of the United States and the Middle East. 
 Day of the Long Night is not a textbook history of Palestine, nor of the Palestine-Israel question. It is, rather, a page from its history meticulously swept under Madison Avenue fallout, biblical circumlocutions, pseudo-prophetic fanaticism, ignorance, and self-serving politics. Not one people has ever been dispossessed of heritage and property on the basis of a vague promise made millennia ago; no society has ever experienced the devastating consequences of one nation's passionate attachment to another. This, then, is the essence of the book: not a sterile recounting of historical fact, but, rather an account of people, living their lives, at times oblivious of their fate, but more often trapped between the Scylla of Zionism and the Charybdis of Western political pandering." <b>Hardcover - November 1997 Price US$29.95, usually ships within 24 hours</b> <a href="/www2.birzeit.edu/links/#top" style="pointer-events: none;">Top of page.</a></font><br><br><br>

Nicholas Guyatt explains the historical context of the latest peace efforts, and the motives and interests of the various players, regional and international, who are

<b>The Rise and Fall of Palestine : A Personal Account of the

CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS, columnist for Vanity Fair and The Nation.<br> "This book is that very rare thing, a book of human experience informed
 by massive historical scholarship, prodigiously detailed political analysis, and exceptional wisdom. I do not know any book like it that deals so intimately and yet so clearly with the tragic quandaries of the Palestinian situation. EDWARD W. SAID, Columbia University<br> "Critical and very well informed..."The Rise and Fall of Palestine" is also quite unusual, virtually unique, because of the rich framework of past and current history that Finkelstein brings to bear in a most illuminating way, because of the interweaving of very thoughtful (and often moving) personal experiences, and because of the singular nature of Finkelstein's perspective, which is sharply different from those that dominate discussions of the situation in Palestine."
