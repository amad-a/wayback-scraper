</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q1"></a>1. WHAT IS ISLAM ?
</b></p><p align="justify">The word 'Islam' means peace and submission. Peace means to be at peace with yourself and your surrounding and submission means submission to God and obey his commandments. A broader meaning of the word Islam is to achieve peace by submitting to the will of God.
</p><p align="justify">This unique religion with a name which signifies a moral attitude and a way of life. Judaism takes its name from the tribe Juda, Christianity from Jesus Christ, Buddhism from Goutam Budha and Hinduism from Indus River. However, Muslims should not be called 'Muhammadans'.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q2"></a>2. WHO IS ALLAH ?
</b></p><p align="justify">Allah is the Arabic word for 'One God', the same as Floh in Aramic. Allah is not God of Muslims only. He is God of all creations, because He is their Creator and the Sustainer.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q3"></a>3. WHO IS A MUSLIM ?
</b></p><p align="justify">The word 'Muslim' means one who submits to the will of God. This is done by declaring that there is no God except one God and Muhammad is the messenger of God. In a broader sense, anyone who willingly submits to the will of God is a Muslim, thus all the prophets preceding the prophet Muhammad (s) were Muslims. The Quran specifically mentions Abraham who lived long before Moses and Christ that, he was not a Jew or a Christian but a Muslim, because, he had submitted to the will of God. Thus there are Muslims who are not submitting at all to the will of God and there are Muslims who are doing their best to live an Islamic life. One cannot judge Islam by looking at those Muslims who have a Muslim name but in their actions, they are not living or behaving as Muslims. The state of being a Muslim can be according to the degree to which one is submitting to the will of God, in his beliefs and his actions.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q4"></a>4. WHO WAS MUHAMMAD (s) ? 
</b></p><p align="justify">In brief, Muhammad (s) was born in a noble tribe of Mecca in Arabia in the year 570 AD. His ancestry goes back to Prophet Ishmael (s), son of Prophet Abraham (p). His father died before his birth and his mother died when he was six. He did not attend any formal school. He was raised first by a nurse as it was the custom those days, and then by his grandfather and uncle. As a young man, he was known as a righteous person who used to meditate in a cave. At age 40, he was given the prophethood when the angel, Gabriel, appeared in the cave. Subsequently, the revelations came over 23 years and are in the book called the Quran which Muslims consider as the final and the last word of God. The Quran has been preserved, unchanged, in its original form and confirms the truth in the Torah, the psalms and the scripture in the existence today with its original Arabic text.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q5"></a>5. DO MUSLIMS WORSHIP MUHAMMAD (s)  ?
</b></p><p align="justify">No. Muslims do not worship Muhammad (s) or any other prophets. Muslims believe in all prophets including Adam, Noah, Abraham, David, Solomon, Moses and Jesus. Muslims believe that Muhammad (s) was the last of the Prophets. They believe that God alone is to be worshipped, not any human being.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q6"></a>6. WHAT DO MUSLIMS THINK OF JESUS  ?
</b></p><p align="justify">Muslims think highly of Jesus (p) and his worthy mother, Mary. The Quran tells us that Jesus was born of a miraculous birth without a father. Lo! The likeness of Jesus with Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust, and then He said unto him: Be and he is (Qu'ran 3.59). He was given many miracles as a prophet. These include speaking soon after birth in defense o f his mother's piety. God's other gifts to him included healing the blind and the sick, reviving the dead, making a bird out of clay and most importantly, the message he was carrying. These miracles were given to him by God to establish him as a prophet. According to the Quran, he was not crucified but was raised into Heaven. (Quran, Chapter Maryam)
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q7"></a>7. DO MUSLIMS HAVE MANY SECTS  ?
</b></p><p align="justify">Muslims have fewer sects than Christians. In Islam, there are two major sects, the Shia and the Sunni. Both sects have many things in common. They follow the same book -
Quran. They follow the same prophet, (Muhammad). Both offer their prayers five times a day. Both fast in the month of Ramadan. They both go for hajj, pilgrimage to Mecca. The differences between these two sects are more like those found between any two different schools of thought. Those who follow Prophet Muhammad in accordance with his sayings and actions are called Sunni and those who in addition follow the sayings and views of Ali (Muhammad's son-in-law), as the rightful successor to Prophet Muhammad, are called Shia. Shia means a partisan (party of Ali) and is started more as a political party to help Ali in his conflict with his political adversaries. Most Shias live in Iran and Iraq while the rest of the Muslim world is mostly Sunni. Shias comprises about 16 percent of the Muslim population. Contrary to common accusation, neither Shia nor Sunni are militant. Their actions sometimes are in reaction to the oppression that that they have suffered.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q8"></a>8. WHAT ARE THE PILLARS OF ISLAM ?
</b></p><p align="justify">There are five articles of faith commonly known as the five Pillars of Islam. These pillars are
</p><p>1. the- belief (Iman) in one God and that Muhammad is His messenger,
</p><p>2. prayers (Salat) which are prescribed five times a day,
</p><p>3. fasting (Siyam) which is required in the month of Ramadan,
</p><p>4. charity (Zakat) which is the poor-due on the wealth of the rich and
</p><p>5. hajj which is the pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime if one can afford it physically and financially.
</p><p>Pillars are part of a building. The building in this case is the perfect human who cares and protect rights of all creations and fellow humans thus establishing a society in which justice and peace is supreme.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q9"></a>9. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF WORSHIP IN ISLAM ?
</b></p><p align="justify">The purpose of worship in Islam is to make the person God conscious. Thus the worship, whether it is prayer, fasting, or charity, is a means to an end and end is to seek the pleasure of God by becoming God conscious in thought and actions. Thus he is better p4iced to receive His bounties both n this world and the Hereafter.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q10"></a>10. DO MUSLIMS BELIEVE IN THE HEREAFTER ?
</b></p><p align="justify">God is just and therefore, in order to exercise His justice, there has to be a system of accountability. Those who do good have to be rewarded and those who do wrong have to be punished accordingly. Therefore, He created Heaven and Hell and there are admission criteria for each of them. Muslims believe that the present life is a temporary one. It is a test and if we pass the test, we will be given a life of permanent pleasure in the company of good people in Heaven.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q11"></a>11. WILL THE GOOD ACTIONS OF NON-BELIEVERS BE WASTED ?
</b></p><p align="justify">No. The Quran clearly says that, anyone who has an atom's worth of goodness will see it and anyone who has done an atom's worth of evil will also see it. By that it is meant that those who do not believe but have done good, they will be rewarded in this world for their good deed. On the other hand, those who do good if they are Muslims, they will be rewarded not only in this world but also in the world hereafter. However, the final Judgement is up to God himself. (Quran 2.62)
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q12"></a>12. WHAT IS THE DRESS CODE FOR MUSLIMS ?
</b></p><p align="justify">Islam emphasizes modesty. No person should be perceived as a sex object. Guidelines both lot men and women are that their dress should neither be too thin nor too tight to reveal body forms. For men, they must at least cover the area from the knee to the navel and women; their dress should cover all areas except the hands and the face.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q13"></a>13. WHAT ARE THE DIETARY PROHIBITIONS IN ISLAM ?
</b></p><p align="justify">Muslims are told in Quran not to eat pork or pork products, dead animals or meat of the carnivorous animals (as they eat dead animals) or drink in toxicants such as wine or use any drug product.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q14"></a>14. WHAT IS ISLAMIC FUNDAMENDALISM ?
</b></p><p align="justify">As opposed to Christianity, there is no concept of Fundamentalism in Islam. The western media has coined this term to brand those Muslims who wish to return to the basic fundamental principles of Islam and mould their lives accordingly. Islam is a religion of moderation and a practicing Muslim can neither be a fanatic nor an extremist.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q15"></a>15. WHAT IS THE ISLAMIC YEAR ?
</b></p><p align="justify">The Islamic Year started from the migration (Hijra) of Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in 622 AD. It is a lunar year of 354 days. The first.month is called Muharam. 1993 AD is in Islamic year 1413 AH.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q16"></a>16. WHAT ARE THE MAJOR ISLAMIC FESTIVALS ?
</b></p><p align="justify">Idul Fitre, marks the end of fasting in the month of Ramadan and is celebrated with public prayers, feasts and exchange of gifts. ldul Adha marks the end of the Hajj or the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. After the public prayers, those who can afford, sacrifice a lamb, goat, cow or camel to signify Prophet Abraham's obedience to God, shown by his readiness to sacrifice his son Ishmael.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q17"></a>17. WHAT IS SHARIA ?
</b></p><p align="justify">Sharia is the comprehensive Muslim law derived from two sources: (a) the Quran (b) the Sunnah or traditions of Prophet Muhammad (s). It covers every aspect of daily individual and collective living. The purposes of Islamic laws are protection of individuals' basic human rights to include night to life, property. Political and religious freedom and safeguarding the rights of women and minorities. The low crime rate in Muslim societies is to the applicable of the Islamic penal laws. These, however, can only be applied in a society which has established all other Islamic laws to ensure justice and protection of others' rights.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q18"></a>18. WAS ISLAM SPREAD BY THE SWORD ?
</b></p><p align="justify">According to the Quran, There is no compulsion in religion (2:256). Thus no one can be forced to become a Muslim. While it is true that in many places where Muslim armies went to liberate people or the land, they did carry the sword as that was the weapon used at that time. However, Islam did not spread by the sword. In many places where there are Muslims now, in the Far East like Indonesia. in China, and many parts of Africa, there are no records of any Muslim armies having gone there. To say that Islam spread by the sword would be to say that Christianity was spread by guns, F-16's and atomic bombs, etc., which is not true. Chritianity was spread by the missionary works of Christians Ten percent of all Arabs are Christians. The -Sword of Islam could not convert all the non-Muslim minorities in Muslim countries. In India, where Muslims ruled for 700 years, they are still a minority. In the U.S.A.. Islam is the fastest growing,
religion and has 6 million followers and no sword is around.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q19"></a>19. DOES ISLAM PROMOTE VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM ?
</b></p><p align="justify">No, Islam is a religion of peace and submission and stresses the sanctity of human life. A verse in the Quran say, [Chapter 5, verse 32), that anyone who saves one life, it is as if he has saved the whole of mankind and anyone who has killed another person except (in lieu of murder or mischief on earth). It is as it he has killed the whole of mankind. Islam condemns all violence that is sometimes blamed on Muslims and at times are committed by those who have Muslim names. Christianity can not be judged by the violence which happened in the Crusades, in Spain, in WWII, or by acts of people like the Rev. Jim Jones, David Koresh, or the atrocities committed in Bosnia by
the Christian Serbs. Anyone who is doing violence is not practicing his religion at that time. However, sometimes violence is a human response of oppressed people as it happens in Palestine. These people have been displaced from their homeland, been put in refugee camps, and watched their relatives being killed and no one listens to their plight unless they do something to get the attention of the media. Although this is wrong, this is the only way for them to attract attention. There is a lot of terrorism and violence in areas where there is no Muslim Presence. For example, in Ireland, South Africa, Latin America, and Sri Lanka. Sometimes the violence is due to a struggle between those who have with those who do not have, or between those who are oppressed with those who are the oppressors. Wt3 need to find out why people do become terrorists. Unfortunately, the Palestinians who are doing violence are called terrorist but when Tamils in Sri Lanka do the same, they are called rebels.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q20"></a>20. WHAT IS JIHAD ?
</b></p><p align="justify">The word Jihad means struggle, or to be specific, striving in the cause of God. Any struggle done in day-to-day life to please God is considered Jihad. One of the highest levels of Jihad is to stand up to a tyrant and speak a word of truth. Control of the self from wrong doings is the greatest Jihad. One of the forms of Jihad is to take up aims in defense of Islam or a Muslim country when Islam is attacked. This kind of Jihad has to be declared by the religious leadership or by a Muslim head of state who is following Quran and Sunnah.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q21"></a>21. DOES ISLAM PROMOTE POLYGAMY ?
</b></p><p align="justify">For Muslim men to have more than one wife is a permission which is given to them in the Quran provided it's not to satisfy lust but to meet social solutions and needs and then too, provided he is capable of treating them equally. It is not an injunction. In the pre-Islamic period, men used to have many wives. One person had 11 wives and when he became Muslim. he asked the Prophet Muhammad (s), What should I do with so many wives ? and he said, Divorce all except
the four. The Quran says, you can marry 2 or 3 and up to 4 women if you can be equally just with each of them. Since it is very difficult to be equally just with all wives, in practice, most of the Muslim men do not have more than one wife. Prophet Muhammad (s) himself from age 24 to 50 was married to only one woman, Khadija. In the western society, some men who have one wife have many extramarital affairs. Thus, a survey was published in 'U.S.A. Today' (April 4, 1988; Section D) which asked 700 mistresses what they would like their status to be. They said that they preferred being a second wife rather than the 'other woman' because they did not have the legal rights, nor they have the financial equality of the legally married wives, and it is appeared that they were being used by these men. Historically, all prophets except Jesus, who was not married. had more than one wife. So this is nothing that Islam had started, in fact, Islam regulated it.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q22"></a>22. DOES ISLAM OPPRESS WOMEN ?
</b></p><p align="justify">No, On the contrary, Islam elevated the status of women. 1,400 years ago by giving them the right to divorce, tie right to have financial independence and support and the right to be identified as dignified women (Hijab) when in the rest of the world, including Europe, women had no such rights. Women are equal to men in all acts of piety (Quran 33:32). Islam allows women to keep their maiden name after marriage, their earned money and spend it as they wish, and ask men to be their protector as women on the street can be molested. Prophet Muhammad (s) told Muslim men. the best among you is the one who is best to his family. Not Islam, but some Muslim men. do oppress women today. This is because of their cuture habits or their ignorance about their religion.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q23"></a>23. IS ISLAM INTOLERANT OF OTHER RELIGIOUS MINORITIES ?
</b></p><p align="justify">Islam recognizes the fights of the minority. They are not required to do army service. To ensure their welfare and safety, Muslim rulers initiated a tax (Jazia) on them. Prophet Muhammad (s) forbade Muslim armies to destroy churches and synagogues. Caliph Umer did not even allow them to pray inside a church. Jews were welcomed and flourished in Muslim Spain when they were persecuted in the rest of Europe. They consider that part of their history as the golden era. In Muslim countries, Christians live in prosperity, hold government positions and attend their church. Christian missionaries are allowed to establish and operate their schools and hospitals. However, the same religious tolerance is not always available to Muslim minorities as seen in the past during the Spanish inquisition and the Crusades, or as seen now by the events in the former Yugoslavia. Israel and India. Muslims do recognize that sometimes the actions of a ruler does not reflect the teaching of his religion.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q24"></a>24. WHAT IS THE ISLAMIC VIEW ON :
</b></p><p align="justify">a. Dating and premarital sex: Islam does not approve of intimate mixing or informality between the sexes, and forbids premarital or extramarital sex, Islam encourages marriage as a shield to such temptations and as a means of having mutual love, mercy and peace.
</p><p align="justify">b. Abortion: lslam considers abortion as murder and does not permit it except to save the mother's life.
</p><p align="justify">c. Homosexuality and AIDS: Islam categorically opposes homosexuality and considers it a sin. However, Muslim physicians are advised to care for AIDS patients with compassion just as would for other patients.
</p><p align="justify">d. Euthanasia and Suicide: Islam opposes to both suicide and euthanasia. Muslims do not believe in heroic measures to artificially prolong the life in a terminally ill patient. e. Organ transplantation: Islam stresses upon saving lives (Quran 5:32); thus, transplantation in general would be considered permissible provided a donor consent is available. The sale of the organ is not allowed.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="#top">Top</a></b>
</p><p align="center"><b><a name="q25"></a>25. HOW SHOULD MUSLIMS TREAT JEWS AND CHRISTIANS ?
</b></p><p align="justify">The Quran calls them People of the Book, i.e., those who received Divine scriptures before Muhammad (s). Muslims are told to treat them with respect and justice and do not fight with them unless they initiate hostilities or ridicule their faith. The Muslims ultimate hope is that they all will join them in worshipping one God and submit to His will.
</p><p align="justify">Say (O Muhammad): O people of the Book (Jew and Christians) come to an agreement between us and you, that we shall worship none but Allah, and that we Shall take no partners unto Him, and none of us shall take others for Lords Allah. And they turn away. then say: Bear witness that we are those have surrendered (unto Him). (Quran 3:64)
