<p></p><hr size="1">
<p align="justify">A great and successful commander always knows his enemies weakness
and strength before he engaged in a battle with them. Now as a Muslim
to be able to know and identify our enemies will be of an advantage
to us to better fight and overcome them. This is a challenging
mission and lets us track our 10 most wanted enemies. Here is the list:

</p><p>1. Enemy Number One - Shaitan (Lanatullah alihi):
</p><p align="justify">In al-Qur'an, Allah (swt) has mentioned numerous times that shaitan is
our true and real enemy. Even our fore-father Nabi Adam a.s. was not
spared by shaitan's wicked and cunning ways. Please bear in mind that
shaitan is working round the clock, all year round irregardless of
seasons, day or night and is most experienced having lived for
decades. All Muslims must fight this enemy and be wary of its dubious
ploy. Shaitan is with each and every one of us..it is up to us to
destroy its influence by being loyal and obedient only to Allah
(swt).....Only Allah (swt) is our saviour! But we must learn to recognise
the shaitan just listen to his whispering in your heart for that is
the place he loves to reside because he knows that man is constantly
trying to seek his lord with the eyes which do not perceive him for
he is perfect and these eyes are a mere gift for our own benefit. It
is the Heart which sees Allah and recognises his love and majesty we
must purify our hearts and rid shaitan who by staying in the heart as
if though the idols are in the mosque.

</p><p>2. Enemy Number Two - Our Nafs (inner self):
</p><p align="justify">This is a real tough "guy"...it is difficult to break this nafs as it
dwells within us.. When we eat they eat, when we drink they drink but
when we are resting they are plotting to destroy us. Those who
succumbs to his own nafs is in a great lost and is most unfortunate.
In al-Qur'an, Allah (swt) condemns those who follow his/her nafs
without any reservation or thought. Our beloved Rasulullah
(s.a.w).recommended fasting as one of the ways to curb our nafs. The
Nafs is what was bestowed by Allah and is therfor the most important
thing we have Allah says in the Quran Every Nafs shall taste death
and we have also read in Quran and numerous Hadeeth that it is the
nafs which will go to heaven and we know much about the spirituality
of the Prophets and the great Awliya and the Vallyallahs. These
people stopped and worked on their Nafs which is no easy task by any
estimation but non the less the Prophet and the imams have prescribed
many remedies for the Diseases of the Nafs its just a matter of man
becoming awoken from his Ignorance and realizing he can cure his many
problems.
Stress, worry,sadness, lonliness, aimlesness, selfpity, depression, and the
list goes on these are all problems of the Nafs but people dont
realise the cause is sin and not being loyal to Allah hence the
heavenly nafs is made to go against its Nature and therfore when
something is abused or used in a manner not appropriate for it it
just begins to decay or break or seize to function or go berzerk all
of this pleases Shaitan, man enjoys it whilst it lasts but.??

</p><p>3. Enemy Number Three - Our Hearts:
</p><p align="justify">The heart plays the all important role in our well being, be it
physically and/or mentally. Our beloved Rasulullah s.a.w. mentioned
that there is a piece of meat in our body - if it is good, all will
be good but if it is otherwise the rest will suffer and follow suit
to destruction. Our heart (intention) is also vital to separate our
amal. Is it for Allah (swt) or something else. If what we do (our
ibadah, etc) is only for Allah (swt) then that Muslim is most lucky and
fortunate - remember what we vow in our Salat, "inna salati wanusuki
wamayaya wa mamati lillahi rabbal'alamin". All beside Allah (swt) is
immaterial. There are three types of hearts mentioned in al-Qur'an:-
The heart is very sacred we have stored many idols in this heart of
ours when in reality this was only the place to recognise and
communicate with the beloved and feel the pangs of seperation from
Allah but we have found many perverse and unfitting uses for it by
god if people knew what this Celestial Jewel reallly was.
</p><p align="justify">a) The heart that is alive and well:- this belongs to the Muslims who
are steadfast in their ibadah. and are aware of them selves and know
exactly what the reaction of each of their actions is. and they
recognise the Oneness of Allah and can see his Glory everywhere and
pay total homage and allegience to rightly guided and forbid evil and
enjoin good.
</p><p align="justify">b) The heart that is sick:- this belongs to the Muslims with a weak
Iman..they admitted that Allah (swt) is the one and only but their
actions are undesirable and against Allah (swt)'s rules and
regulations. They fully Hypocrisy and pay full Allegience to the
Devil even if they do not realise. their actions always contradict
the laws and guidelines of Allah and use flattery and many other
gestures to act as muslims but really they are in the wrong camp.
</p><p align="justify">c) The heart that is dead:- this belongs to the non-believers, they
know (or sometime just could not be bothered) that Islam is the true
religion but they totally rejected Islam. Also many muslims have dead
hearts liek we have said earlier on the diseases of the heart are
many (this does not include physical illness cancer etc) these are te
hidded mysteries of the Jewel which can be polished so much that you
become one with harmony or you rebel so much that you never ever find
that peace which you see in every face accepts yours.

</p><p>4. Enemy Number Four - This World (al-Dunya):
</p><p align="justify">Rasulullah (s) regarded this "world" as an old lady which has
limited time and is most horrible. By comparing this world with an
old lady Rasulullah (s.a.w). expected us to "shun" from it and be
mindful of what this "dunya" has to offer. Do we want a life of
"pleasure" in this temporary and deceitful abode or do we rather
forgo this "old lady" and wait for a better lady in waiting at
jannah. Rasulullah (s.a.w). mentioned that there will be a time when
this ummah (us) will love this world too great to the extend that we
are afraid of dying, na'uzubillah. We must take what is necessary to
sustain our life in order to facilitate our ibadah to Allah (swt)
(zuhud al-dunya) and please remember Allah (swt) can take us back
anytime, anywhere without a moment notice! The Prophet has (s) said the
world is a corpse and the humans are Dogs eating of it. Imam Ali has
said this world is a forsaken place its promise is fake and its
glamour and glitter is just a temporary thing it deceives and
corrupts it is a muddy drinking hole. The true beliver said the
Prophet (s) to Abu Dharr is he who in this world feels trapped as if a
bird is in acage or a person in a prison the true beliver]wants to be
freed from this world and reach the beloved in the next realm.

</p><p>5. Enemy Number Five - Fellow Humans:
</p><p align="justify">Now this enemy falls into two categories:- the believers and
non-believers. The believers are our own brothers and sisters in
Islam but unfortunately sometimes the enemy within us is much more
dangerous and their "foul play" is much more devastating. Rasulullah
(s.a.w). mentioned that good and true friends are like those selling
perfumes, if we mixed with them the fragrance will linger thus
(effecting) making us smelling good too. However, bad or nasty
friends are compared to a blacksmith..we will feel the hotness (heat)
and the sparks (fire) if we stand near to them... Now the choice is
yours..it is up to us to choose our friends:- to smell nice or be
scalded or burnt? Sometimes, we are betrayed and sabotaged by our own
Muslim brothers and there are many a time when our jealousy and pride
get the better of us and into the way of the success of our Muslims
brothers. We feel threatened and envious of their success and
happiness and decide once for all to destroy him. Now who is the
winner in this game? The non-believers on other hand will always hate
Islam, be it because of their ignorance or just blindly motivated by
nafs (unless they are given "tawfiq and hidayah" from Allah) they
will only be happy if we follow their ways and lifestyles.

</p><p>6. Enemy Number Six - Your Family:
</p><p align="justify">Our family will be our enemy without we realising it. This is very
evident especially if we are the head of the family and responsible
for our members of family. We must heed Allah (swt)'s advice to protect
ourselves and our family against the fire (hell). This call from
Allah (swt) is often ignored by us...sometime to wake our children for
Salat fajr we are reluctant we reasoned that they need the rest
(sleep) and have to go to school. We are more worried if they will be
successful in this world ...but do we ever think about their
afterlife? If you really love your family please do them and
yourselves this favour to observe Allah (swt) commands and
prohibitions, insha'allah. The family also makes many demands which
can at times be unlawful man spends his whole time pleasing his
family but they are never satisfied with him unless they are
beleiving and god fearing people. If that much effort was put into
trying to secure the Bounties of the next world than we would all be
successful.

</p><p>7. Enemy Number Seven - Your 'Ibadah:
</p><p align="justify">You might be wondering how can your "ibadah" be your enemy. This is
true when your ibadah is not done properly according to its rules.
Allah (swt) will throw back your Salat "IN YOUR FACE!" (no..not ESPN
style) if you do it hastily without ever considering why you Salat in
the first place or without understanding what you are doing or if it
is done with the wrong intention. Our ibadah is for Proximity to
Allah (swt)..if after this while, you see no improvement in yourselves
in terms of your character, behaviour etc..there is a high chance
that you are not really concentrating on your ibadah. It is true who
are we (human) to judge one's ibadah:- is it acceptable or not by
Allah (swt)? However please bear in mind Allah (swt) has set certain
guidelines for us to gauge on how best we have performed in our
ibadah..we will not see our fellow sisters who observe the Salat not
putting on the "hijab" and we will not hear of any power struggle
especially in mosques?

</p><p>8. Enemy Number Eight - Time:
</p><p align="justify">Time is actually not your enemy if you spend it wisely and only to
seek Allah (swt)'s blessing. In this world time is of an essence..each
second goes without you noticing that you are actually wasting time.
Now ask this yourselves "What have I done or achieved in this world
that will guarantee or defend me in life hereafter".. Most of the
time, we complained and lamented that we do not have enough time on
our hands..just stop grumbling and start now..insya'allah if you are
sincere and work hard towards seeing an improvement Allah (swt) will
help you..Don't blame "time" as your defence..time is also Allah
(swt)'s creation and servant.. so work with this limited time to gain
full-time happiness in heaven. Time is on nobodies side that is why
Allah swears by Time and says surely man is in loss but do we ever
take Heed and look at our time which has passed and do we deeply sit
and think about our age and how quickly we have become twenty or
thirty or fourty and so on how much do we have left if time continues
at the pace it has done that means in no Time we will all be dead so
your buggered but buggered for ever not just a timely punishment like
on earth but ETERNAL fire and or BLISS deppending on how you spent your time.

</p><p>9. Enemy Number Nine - Ignorant:
</p><p align="justify">In fact, ignorance is one of the greatest enemy. One will be totally
lost without proper knowledge especially about Islam. Knowledge is
power:- the power to differentiate what is right and wrong. A Muslim
who is hardworking in ibadah without the knowledge on what or how an
ibadah is to be performed, that ibadah will be rendered null and
void. What do you gain from this type of ibadah nothing but
tiredness! Rasulullah (s.a.w). encouraged Muslims to seek knowledge
from cradle (birth) to the grave (death). Only knowledge will make us
a better Muslim and again ignorance will get us nowhere be it in this
world much more later in life hereafter. To be Ignorant of the fact
that you are ignorant is the worst kind of ignorance because majority
of Muslims suffer from this very type of ignorance people generally
think that they are o.k. and will be saved some how but unless you
fully understand each tenet of Islam and follow it because your
intellect demands it because all your searching for truth have been
fully satisfied and you have realized the oneness of Allah and are
Intoxicated by his Majesty and Beauty which is prevelent everywhere
unless this happens you are still one of the Ignorant.

</p><p>10. Enemy Number Ten - You (Yourself):
</p><p align="justify">"Yes, You! Do not turn around!" We always blame others but do we
really take a look at the man in the mirror and put the blame on him.
Yes, the above mentioned enemies are true and we must make an effort
to avoid (get rid of) them....but if we keep blaming them and we,
ourselves do not make the effort to change or improve in that case
what is the use of knowing all your enemies and we still keep
"inviting" them to us? We must force ourselves to fight these and the
first change we have to make is within ourselves....(not just a
change of clothes?) but totally from inside-out, when we succeed in
this the rest will be easy and nothing...shaitan lanatullah will
"wash its hands" on judgement day..we will not be able to turn around
or look up and blame them, we will be responsible for our own acts!.
The devil cannot make you do anything thats what people say and
unfortunetly most people are still in this thinking that shaitan has
horns and fire coming out from his nose. This is not the case we all
can become Shaitans in an instance because he is the one who" Excites
VAIN desire within us" but we then follow out his command which comes
in the form of our own personal wish this is how badly we follow him
that when ever he wants to lead us Astray his wish is our desire and
we always feel as i did this i did that yes its true we commited the
action so there for we will suffer in the Grave and on the Promised
day whilst Shaitan will be laughing at our faces and saying i only
created blocks for you and you fell into them.

</p><p align="justify">Dear brothers and sisters, there is a saying - know your enemy and
you will know yourselves. To know yourself is to know your Lord this
saying is so true ask those people who sin to tell you who makes them
sin. they will either say themselves or they will blame society and
culture etc but that is because they are slaves to their own Nafs
which is being controlled by shaitan how many people actually reflect
on this issue very few thats why Muslim women today see everything as
here and now and wish to enjoy their beauty and forsake the Hijab
because they dont realize reality and think there is enough time in
old age to make up for lost time but it really does not work like
this because firstly death can approach at any time secondly if we
spent fifty years sinning our nafs and way of thinking will be so
polluted and fully under shaitans rule it will be much much harder to
come to the straight path. We now know our most deadly enemies now it
is up to us to face the challenge and fight them. This task will be
easy for some and difficult for others but as long as we make the
effort, Allah (swt) will definitely guide us.

</p><p align="justify">I hope and pray for all Muslims to be able to face this
10 MOST WANTED and come out, triumphant. Amin.
