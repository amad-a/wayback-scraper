The Fiqh is the summation of the rules and regulations formulated by the leader of the
Madhhab according to certain methodology (format) formulated by that Madhhab.

Since each Madhhab has its particular Fiqh, the rules of one Madhhab may

differ in subtle or not so subtle ways from other Madhhabs. A Hanafi may differ from

a Shafii and Hanbali, a Maaliki may differ from Hanafi or Shafii or

Shia. The Shia may differ from most of the Sunni Madhhabs, or be in

agreement with 3 out of 4 in some aspects. In this publication some outstanding matter in

the technique of performing the Salat are explained.

put in a table. To have more detail about some points the reader is referred to the

specific items that appear below that table. These items explain the rules (Ahkaam)

of different Madhhabs. Thus it is recommended that the reader pays special attention

to the rules in the items and compare them with those appearing in the table itself.

Shafii say Athan is a Sunnah, near Wajib (a Must). Al-Hanbali on the other hand

regards Athan as Fardh, while many of its followers regard it as Sunnah.

<b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>2. Takbiraat:</b> All say Takbiraat 4 times except the Maaliki who say it 2 times. 
<b>

</b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>3. Wali</b>: As an option (even Mustahab) Shia say Ali is the

devotee of Allah twice. None of Sunni Madhhabs say it. Many Shia do not

say it either. 

<b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>4. Khayr Al-Amal</b>: To say hayya Ala Khayr al-amal is a must (Wajib)

for Shia, since this was said by the Prophet (s), Abu Bakr, and early days of

Omar's Khilaafah, as well as cotninued by Ibn Omar, Ali ibn Al-Husain, Zayd ibn

Arqam, Imam Ali and numerous others. This was stopped by order of Khalifa Omar since

according to his Ijtihaad he was afraid that saying it in Athan or Iqaama would

discourage Muslims from emphasizing Jihad (See Al-Bahr Al-Zaakhir, Vol. 1, Page 192. Also

Al-Muhalla, Vol. 3, Page 160).

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">None of the Hanafi, Maaliki, Shafii, or Hanbali say it.

<b>

</b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>5. Nawm:</b> Because this was not said at the time of Prophet Muhammad

(s) Shia do not say it in their Athan or Iqaama. The phrase of (Salat is

better than sleeping) was introduced by Khalifa Omar. (See Muwatta Malik, in Masabih

Al-Sunnah, Al-Baghwi, Vol. 1, Page 37). This became a routine afterwards by Hanafi,

Maaliki, and Hanbali. Imam Ali said not to increase in the Athan what was not intended in it.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Shafii: It is Makrooh (detestable) to say the phrase.
<b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>IQAAMA</b> While Shia utter the Iqaama like their Athan but

with every phrase twice said, and the last phrase once, Sunni Madhhabs have

differed remarkably in the number of times the phrases (be they Takbiraat or others) are said.

<b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>6. Takbir Iftitah:</b> To say ALLAHU Akbar after the intention to pray

is Wajib (a Must) with Shia, Maaliki, and Hanbali. 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The Hanafi may say any of the wordings of Al-Asmaa al-Husna, yet Abu

  Yusuf prefer Shia ruling.

  </p><p align="JUSTIFY">The Shafii may say Allah Al-Akbar (they have added Al, meaning

  the). See Sharh Al-Muwatta, Al-Baji, Vol. 1, Page 142. Also Al-Mugni, Ibn

  Qidaamah, Vol. 1, Page 460).

<b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>7. Arms:</b> Shia, along with the Maliki do not fold their

arms while in Wuqoof, though it is allowed if believed as an option of reverence on the

part of the person praying. Some Shia authorities even regard it as an invalidator

of the Salat (if done thinking this is the correct way). (See Al-Majmoo, Vol.

1, page 312). It is said that folding the arms was started after the Prophet (s).

  <b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Hanafi, Shafii, and Hanbali</b>: Regard folding the arms as

  preferable (Mustahab) as a sign of reverence, therefore, they subscribe for folding the

  arms during Wuqoof, however, they differ in the manner the right arm is to be put on the

  left, whether on lower chest or its upper, in a female different from a male.

  <b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Maaliki</b> regards folding the arms, if done, as allowed, but not a  Sunnah.

<b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>8. Basmalah:</b> While Shia start the Surahs by saying

Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Rahim (Basmalah), as part of the Surah, they are to say it

loud enough to be heard. The Prophet (s) used to start Al-Fatiha with Basmalah

but Muawiya was the culprit in deleting it. (See Al-Umm, Al-Shafii, Vol. 1, Page 108).

  <b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Hanafi, and Maaliki</b>: They regard Basmalah as not part of

  Surah Fatiha, so they read Surah Al-Fatiha without it, though they have the option to say

  it. However, they say Basmalah with the subsequent Surahs. Also, the Hanafi and

  Hanbali can read it without being heard. Maaliki would not read at all.

  <b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Shafii and Hanbali</b>: Regard Basmalah as part and

  parcel of Al-Fatiha, and has to be said loudly. (See Al-Uddah, Vol. 2, Box 410. Also

  Al-Muntaqa, Vol. 1, page 151).

<b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>9. Amen</b>: Because Amen is a Hebrew word, Shia's Fiqh

prohibits saying it during Salat, otherwise, their Salat becomes invalid. However, they

can say "Amen" when not in Salat. Instead of Amen, Shia say Al-Hamdu

Lillaah. (See Al-Saadiq and the Four Madhhabs, Vol. 3, page 331. Also Fiqh according

to the five Madhhabs, Muhammad J. Maghniya, page 111).

  <b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Hanafi, Maaliki, Shafii, and Hanbali</b>: As Mustahab

  (preferable) they say Amen after reading the Fatiha during Salat. They follow what Abu

  Hurairah once recommended to utter "Amen" after Al-Fatiha, but Shia

  claim that the specific narration was not credible. (See Bukhari, Section Salat. Also Fiqh

  according to the five Madhhabs, Muhammad J. Maghniya, page 111).

<b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>10. Sura: </b>While Shiaa complete (not partial) Surah has to

be said following Al-Fatiha during Salat, and without this rule the Salat is invalidated.

Other Madhhabs are divided about this point, for instance, with the Hanafi portion

of a Surah is sufficient, even one Ayah.

<b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>11. Qunoot</b>: Qunoot is saying a Duaa, usually a passage from

the Holy Quran. Qunoot is highly recommended (preferable) with Shia, since the

Prophet (s) used to do so. Qunoot is not practiced regularly in the other

Madhhabs during regular Salat, though the Prophet (s) used to practice it but

more than 40 years later Muawiya stopped it. (See Al-Saadiq and the Four

Madhhabs, Asad Haidar, Vol. 3). However, Qunoot is said during Subh Salat (morning

prayer) by the Maaliki and Shafii. As to the Hanafi and Hanbali, they say Qunoot

during Witr Salat in various manners. 

<b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>12. Forefinger:</b> Shia do not point with the forefinger

while in Tashahhud. The Hanafi and Shafii do point with the forefinger and

even move it in a circular manner, as a preferable (Mustahab) procedure.

<b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>13. Toe</b>: While Shia are to sit comfortably on the folded

feet during Tashahhud, the Hanafi are to sit on the twisted left foot while the big

toe of the right foot is touching the floor.

<b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>14. Tashahhud</b>: Shia follow the version of

Tashahhud as taught by Ahlul Bayt quoting the Prophet (s). 

  </p><p align="JUSTIFY">The Hanafi follow the Tashahhud taught by Ibn Masood, quoting the

  Prophet (s). 

  </p><p align="JUSTIFY">The Maaliki follow the Tashahhud taught by Ibn Omar, quoting the

  Prophet (s).

  </p><p align="JUSTIFY">While the Sahafii and Hanbali follow the Tashahhud taught

  by Ibn Abbas, quoting the Prophet (s). 

<b></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>15. Tasleem</b>: Shia follow the version of Tasleem as taught

by Ahlul Bayt quoting the Prophet (s). Tasleem is a Must (Wajib). The Hanafi,

Shafii, and Hanbali do Tasleem in various forms as appears in Sahih Bukhari and

Muslims. It is regarded as Wajib (a Must) by the Maaliki, Shafii and Hanbali; and as

Sunnah by the Hanafi (See Kashf Al-Ghumma, Al-Sharani, vol. 2, page 220. Also

Musnad Ahmad, Vol. 2, page 162).
