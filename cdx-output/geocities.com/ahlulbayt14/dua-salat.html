<h1 align="center">Du'a (Supplications) After Dialy Prayers</h1>
<p></p><hr noshade="">
<p></p><h2 align="center">The Morning Du'a</h2>

<p></p><hr noshade="">
<p align="justify">In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. By

the Name of Allah and peace of Allah on Mohammed (s)

and His sacred progeny and I entrust my work unto Allah

and verily Allah is all seeing for His creatures.

"There is no God But You, Glory to You, I was in the

dark then We granted him his (Prophet Younus (p)) request and
redeemed him from the panic and in like manner We redeem

the believers". 
</p><p align="justify">Suffices Allah, how good and trustworthy and the

prospective crusaders returned (as there has been no

fight any longer) with grants and the grace of Allah,

sins harm and injury. Whatever Allah wishes and there be

no might and force except by Allah. Whatever Allah wishes

and not whatever the people wish. Suffices the Patron

rather than the patronized. Suffices the Creator rather

than the creatures. Suffices the Giver rather than the

given. Suffices Allah the Patron of Worlds. Suffices the

Sufficient from my inception, The Infinite Sufficient

suffices Allah, There is no Allah but He. I trust Him and

He is the Patron of the Great Empyrean. 

</p><p></p><hr noshade="">

<p></p><h2 align="center">The Midday Du'a</h2>
<p></p><hr noshade="">

<p align="justify">In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.

There is no god except Allah the Supreme and the Clement.

There is no god except Allah the Patron of the Benevolent

Empyrean. Thanks to Allah, the Patron of the worlds. I

pray to You O Allah for the causes of Your Beneficence

and the (esteemed) intents of Your Pardon and the

Bounties from all virtues and safety from all sins. O

Allah, let me have no sin, but You pardon it please, no

pain but relieved by You, no malady but cured by You, no

slip but cured by You, no talents but increasingly

magnified by You, no fear, but I be indemnified by You,

no evil but I be protected from by You, no need unto You,

with your consent, with a good for me therein, but

granted by You, O Merciful of mercifuls. Amen, Patron of

the Worlds.

</p><p></p><hr noshade="">

<p></p><h2 align="center">The Afternoon Du'a</h2>
<p></p><hr noshade="">

<p align="justify">In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. O

Allah, I beg to be protected from unquenching ego and

from an unfearing heart (not fearing God) and from an

unyielding knowledge and from an untranscending prayer

and from an inaudible prayer (ungrantable request). 

</p><p align="justify">O Allah, I beg You restoration after affliction,

relief after grief, relaxation after constriction. My

Lord, whatever talents I have got, it is but from You.

There is no god but You. I beg Your pardon and seek

atonement. 

</p><p></p><hr noshade="">

<p></p><h2 align="center">The Evening Du'a</h2>

<p></p><hr noshade="">

<p align="justify">In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. I

beg You, O Allah, the causes of Your mercy and intents of

pardon and salvation from Hell and from all trials,

Heavenly success and Your esteemed attention in the land

of peace and from all trials and the proximity of Your

Prophet Hazrat Mohammed (s) peace be on him and

peace on his progeny. O Allah, whatever talents I have

got, it is but from You. There is no god but You. I beg

Your pardon and seek atonement. 

</p><p></p><hr noshade="">
<p></p><h2 align="center">The Night Du'a</h2>

<p></p><hr noshade="">
<p align="justify">In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. O

Allah, I beg to request You that I have no knowledge of

the estuaries of my provisions and I no doubt seek it

because of the uncertainties springing in my heart so I

hustle about in the cities in seeking it. I be therein

like a confounded seeker, not knowing either it is in

plains or is it in mountains, either in the land or in

the rivers, yonder anyone or before anyone, and I do know

that You have its knowledge, its means at Your hands and

You are the one awarding it by Your favor and executing

it by Your favor. O Allah, peace be on Hazrat Mohammed

(s) and his sacred progeny, and favor me, O Lord,

ever magnifying provisions, its seeking easier and its

attainment nearer, and not strain me from tapping sources

having no provisions therein for me. And You are over and

above straining me, and I a beggar of Your favor, and

peace be on Mohammed (s) and his sacred progeny, and

ameliorate me by Your favors. Verily You have abundant favors.
