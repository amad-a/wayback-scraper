<h1>Ayatullah Abu al-Qasim Al-khoei</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.geocities.com/ahlulbayt14/is4.gif">
</p><p></p><hr size="1">
<p align="justify">He was born on Rajab 15, 1317 A.H. (November 19, 1899) at khoei in Iranian
Azerbaijan, heartland of many great Shi'a thinkers. Even in his early childhood, Al-khoei
was versed in religious Persian and Arabic poetry and languages, and in Turkish as well.
It was in 1330 A.H./1912 A.D. that Al-khoei, who was then only thirteen years old,
migrated to al-Najaf al-Ashraf, Iraq, in pursuit of knowledge. Even then, he was
characterised by brilliance and a readiness to absorb knowledge and scholarship. In all
stages of his study and research, progress and success were his companions. 
<i><b></b></i></p><p><i><b>THE HAWZA</b></i></p><p align="justify">
Ten centuries ago, a university-type hawza was founded by the most knowledgeable person
then alive, namely shaikh Muhammad ibn al-Hassan al-Toosi, may Allah have mercy on his
soul. Al-Toosi was an intellectual giant, a genius by all standards, and a man who was
able to absorb various types of knowledge and science. He was the undisputed authority in
Fiqh, the founder of the science of hadith, an innovative mentor of the science of Usool,
nay, the scholar of scholars in all branches of knowledge related to the science of
biographies, Akhlaq, and ilm-al-kalam. Thus did al-Toosi lay the foundation for the hawza
which has been functioning since then, i.e. since 449 A.H. 
</p><p align="justify">Since that year, this blessed hawza has passed through three significant periods: The
first extended from its year of establishment till early tenth century; the second period
started from then and ended at the early twelfth century; the third period started from
then and continued till our present time. During each of these periods, certain
personalities rose to distinction and contributed to the development and improvement of
the functions of this great university; here is their short list: 
 </p><p align="justify">Those who were distinguished during the first period included the founder, Shaikh
 al-Toosi, his son al-Hassan ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hassan who is well known as Abu Ali
 al-Toosi, and Abul-Nasr Muhammad ibn Abu Ali ibn Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn al-Hassan
 al-Toosi. 
 </p><p align="justify">Scholars whose star shone during its second period were many; among them are:
 al-Muqaddas Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Ardabili, then the lighthouse of knowledge Jamalud-Deen
 al-Hassan ibn Zaynul-Deen, the Second Martyr, then Shaikh Ahmed ibn Isma'eel al-Jazairi,
 author of Ayat al Ahkam, then both famous scholars Sayyid Muhammad Mahdi Bahr al-Uloom and
 Shaikh Ja'far Kashiful-Ghita. 
 </p><p align="justify">Men of this period are innumerable, yet the most renown among them are: Sayyid Muhammad
 Mahdi Bahr al-Uloom, Shaikh Ja'far Kashiful-Ghita, Shaikh Muhammad Hussain al-Najafi,
 author of Al Jawahir, Shaikh al-Ansari, author of Al Makasib wal Rasaail, Muhammad Kazim
 al-Khurasani, author of Al Kifayah, and Sayyid Muhammad Kazim al-Yazdi, author of Al
 Urwah. Less renown were scholars such as Mirza Hussain al-Naeeni, Shaikh Muhammad Hussain
 al-Isfahani, Shaikh Diyaud-Deen al-Iraqi, Sayyid Abul-Hassan al-Isfahani, and Sayyid
 Muhsin al-Tabatabai al-Hakim (the grand Ayatullah who preceded the late grand Ayatullah
 Abul-Qasim Al-khoei).
</p><p align="justify">The list is concluded by men of genius such as Abul-Qasim al-Moosawi Al-khoei, may
Allah be pleased with him, during whose period the hawza became like a bee-hive, full of
energy and productivity and scholarly competition. Some scholars have described this
particular period as the period of the Renaissance of the hawza, while others refer to it
as the period of the perfection of scholarship due to the large number of those who proved
their genius and due to the huge public demand from Arab and non-Arab seekers of knowledge
to study there.
<i><b></b></i></p><p><i><b>MENTORS OF AL-KHOEI</b></i></p><p align="justify">
If we were to research the fountainheads that nurtured the intellect of the late Al-khoei,
we will come across a list of the finest among all contemporary scholars such as Shaikh
Fath-Allah who is better known as Shaikh al-Sharee'a al-Isfahani, Shaikh Mahdi
al-Mazandarani, Shaikh Diyaud-Deen al-Iraqi, Shaikh Muhammad Hussain al-Kampani
al-Isfahani, Shaikh Muhammad Hussain al-Naeeni, Shaikh Muhammad Jawad al-Balaghi, and
others. All of these men were considered as pioneers in the fields of their
specialisation. The impact of these men on shaping the mind of the late Al-khoei is best
described by Al-khoei himself who has said:
 </p><p align="justify">"I have learned from each one of them a complete course in the science of Usool,
 and digested a number of books in the science of Fiqh, for many years. I used to provide a
 critique of the research relevant of each one of them before a number of scholars who
 specialised in that branch of knowledge, and my audience included a good number of very
 highly respected scholars. Al-Naeeni, may Allah have mercy on his soul, was the last
 mentor I used to accompany more frequently than anyone else." 
</p><p align="justify">If you read Al Bayan fee Tafseer al Qur'an, you will most likely think it was written
by al-Balaghi, may Allah rest his soul in piece, but worded by Al-khoei! 
<i><b></b></i></p><p><i><b>AL-KHOEI AS MENTOR</b></i></p><p align="justify">
The above covers the stage of the life of Al-khoei when he was a student. This chapter
deals with his being a professor who taught the most significant stages of theological
studies in Islam, namely the stages of al sutooh and al kharij, which may be compared to
the M.A. and Ph.D. respectively. Al-khoei, may Allah be pleased with him, coloured both
stages with his own hue and stamped them with his own stamp; thus, a new generation of
scholars graduated from his school; nay! A whole new generation of scholars graduated from
his school as masters of the sciences of fiqh, usool, hadith, ilm al rijal, tafseer, and
ilm al kalam. Roughly translated, these sciences may be said to be the sciences of
jurisprudence, basics of jurisprudence, traditions, biographies, exegesis, interpretation
of the Holy Qur'an, and theological philosophy, respectively. 
</p><p align="justify">Al-khoei had his own style in teaching and tutoring. Those who graduated from his
courses describe his method of teaching as immaculately minute, stunningly easy and clear,
amazingly logical. They say that there is neither undue complexity nor ambiguity in his
style, and this can be said about all the courses he taught. How was his style in
discussing and debating? The answer to this question is provided by one of his students:
the struggling scientist, the pioneer and the shining star Shaikh Muhammad Jawad
Maghniyyah who has said the following in this regard: 

 </p><p align="justify">"He [Al-khoei] was like the sun that sends its rays everywhere, all the time. He
 was my professor and the professor of all other scholars at al-Najaf al-Ashraf, and the
 pivot round which the motion of scholarship revolved, and to whom the hawza is indebted
 for appreciation and loyalty... His was the golden age during which stars such as
 al-Shaikh al-Ansari and al-Shaikh al-Khurasani and their disciples shone... He remained
 [at the hawza] for more than seventy years learning, teaching, writing, helping scholars
 graduate, debating newcomers as well as alumni... His style in discussing and debating is
 that of Socrates: He deliberately feigns his lack of knowledge and pretends to accept the
 argument of the other party, then he confronts him with doubts and assails him with
 questions. He pretends to seek benefit and guidance from his opponent, just as a student
 or an inquirer may do, so much so that when the poor debater innocently and with naivete
 provides an answer, he sharply assails him, pouncing down on him like an eagle and
 dragging him to show him the facts that support his own argument and from which the
 opponent cannot rescue himself. He then causes his opponent to unknowingly contradict
 himself, forcing him to admit his error and ignorance." 
<i><b></b></i></p><p><i><b>TEACHING THE AL-KHARIJ STAGE</b></i></p><p align="justify">
In order to demonstrate the extent of contribution of his late holiness Al-khoei, consider
the following facts: 
</p><p align="justify">* Shaikh Murtada al-Ansari founded and polished the science of usool more than a
century and a half ago; 
</p><p align="justify">* Shaikh Murtada al-Ansari continued learning then teaching this science for more than
twenty five years; 
</p><p align="justify">* Al-Mirza Habib al-Rashti dedicated thirty years of his life to the study of this
science alone; 
</p><p align="justify">* Shaikh al-Akhoond al-Khurasani continued his studies of this science for more or less
than twenty years; 
</p><p align="justify">* Al-Mirza al-Naeeni continued studying this science for twenty-five years and a few
months; 
</p><p align="justify">* Shaikh Diyaud-Deen al-Iraqi dedicated more than thirty years of his life to the study
of this science; 
</p><p align="justify">* Shaikh al-Kampani Muhammad Hussain al-Isfahani was distinguished by the fact that he
spent thirty years of his life studying only this science; 
</p><p align="justify">* Al-Sayyid Abul-Qasim Al-khoei passed the stage of Usool and continued teaching the
much more advanced stage of al kharij for more than fifty years...! The number of his
graduates is estimated at tens of thousands... 
</p><p align="justify">In order to form an idea about what this stage involves, let us ask its professor
himself about it, for surely his answer is more precise than that of anyone else. He, may
Allah be pleased with him, says: 

 </p><p align="justify">"I have taught extensively, delivering numerous lectures in Fiqh, Usool, and
 Tafsir, nurturing a large number of highly respected students at the hawza of al-Najaf
 al-Ashraf. I delivered my lectures in the stage of al Kharij for two complete courses
 utilising the scholarly achievements of his holiness al-Shaikh al-Ansari, the greatest
 mentor, may Allah be pleased with him, and I taught a number of other books as well. Then
 I taught two complete courses related to the Book of Salat (prayers). On Rabi' al-Awwal
 27, 1377 A.H. I started teaching Al Urwah al Wuthqa by the faqih of the school of thought
 al-Sayyid Muhammad Kazim al-Tabatabai al-Yazdi, starting with the Book of Tahara
 (cleanliness), after having taught ijtihad and taqleed. I continued, by the Grace of
 Allah, doing so for a good while till I reached the Book of Ijarah which I started
 teaching on Rabi' al-Thani 26, 1400 A.H., finishing it in the month of Safar of the year
 1401 A.H. I delivered my lectures in the science of Usool, in the stage of al Kharij for
 six complete courses, concluding them with the research on al didd. During the past few
 years, I have been teaching the exegesis of the Holy Qur'an till circumstances beyond my
 control forced me to terminate them..." 
</p><p align="justify">Books written by Al-khoei and already published have already numbered ninety, not
counting his numerous manuscripts. The topics his writings have covered include Islamic
law, religious biographies, philosophy and commentary of the Holy Qur'an. His best known
books of guidance are being used today throughout the Shi'a world, and they have been
reprinted numerous times, and every Shi'a country in the world boasts eminent scholars who
were his students. This figure demonstrates the power of his overflowing pen despite his
numerous responsibilities as the spiritual leader of two hundred million Shi'a Muslims
world-wide and the person responsible for their guidance in matters related to both
secular and theological problems. It is truly a task that distracts one from reading, let
alone writing.
<i><b></b></i></p><p><i><b>NAJAF'S HAWZA UNDER HIS SUPERVISION</b></i></p><p align="justify">
The monumental achievement of his late holiness Abul-Qasim Al-khoei is his development and
improvement of Najaf's theological school known as al hawza al ilmiyya, the inclusive
school of knowledge and scholarship over which he presided in 1970 after being elected
successor to the late Ayatullah  Sayyid Muhsin al-Tabatabai al-Hakim. He is
described by his students as a compassionate father, a man who believed in moderation and
who led a most austere life in strict adherence to the tenets of the Islamic faith.
Al-khoei had attained the coveted title of "Ayatullah" when he was in his early
thirties. The hawza at al-Najaf al-Ashraf has been for the past ten centuries attracting
students from all over the world. The main topics taught at the hawza are: philosophy,
theology, and jurisprudence, and the number of its students and teachers during its hay
days reached 10,000. It contains several libraries where ancient and rare manuscripts are
treasured and guarded as one would guard a gold mine. In Najaf in general and around the
premises of the hawza in particular, bookstores outnumber grocery stores. 
</p><p align="justify">The hawza also accommodates facilities for the use of manuscript copiers. Learning at
it is a full-time career, and students actually live and learn at the same place where
they are offered very modest accommodations. There were dark periods when this great
centre of learning was fought and its teachers hunted. To be exact, that was the period
when Iraq was placed by strong foreign nations under the British mandate. The British, who
claim to be the most civilised people in the world and the champions of learning, chased
Muslim theologians because of the latter's opposition to their presence in Iraq. One
teacher recollects how he and other fellow teachers during that dark period of persecution
by the British had nothing to eat all day long, so, they would wait till the dark to go
out to the streets looking for the skins of watermelons whereby they could sustain
themselves. 
<i><b></b></i></p><p><i><b>SOME OF HIS RENOWNED STUDENTS</b></i></p><p align="justify">
It is no exaggeration to indicate here that 70% of Shi'a scholars world-wide are either
graduates of Al-khoei's hawza or students of such graduates, and each one of them is like
a bright star. Only Allah knows the exact numbers of those taught directly by Al-khoei or
by his students, but we would like here to indicate some of the most renown scholars who
were students of Imam Al-khoei and who are very well known throughout the Islamic world: 

 </p><p align="justify">The great Islamic philosopher, theologian and economist Martyr Ayatullah Sayyid
 Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr
 </p><p align="justify">Ayatullah Sayyid Ali Beheshti
 </p><p align="justify">The authority-referee, scholar and philosopher Hujjatul-Islam Shaikh Muhammad Taqi
 al-Ja'fari, 
 </p><p align="justify">Ayatullah Sayyid Taqi al-Qummi, 
 </p><p align="justify">Ayatullah Sayyid Ali al-Sistani, 
 </p><p align="justify">Ayatullah Sayyid Muhammad al-Roohani, 
 </p><p align="justify">The scholar Hujjatul-Islam Shaikh Muhammad Asif al-Muhsini, 
 </p><p align="justify">The scholar Hujjatul-Islam Shaikh Muhammad Mahdi Shamsud-Deen,
 </p><p align="justify">The scholar Hujjatul-Islam Sayyid Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah, 
 </p><p align="justify">Ayatullah Shaikh Hussein al-Waheed,
 </p><p align="justify">The scholar Hujjatul-Islam Sayyid Muhyi al-Deen al-Ghuraifi,
 </p><p align="justify">The scholar Hujjatul-Islam Shaikh Muhammad Ishaq al-Fayyad,
 </p><p align="justify">The scholar Hujjatul-Islam Sayyid Ali Mekki, 
 </p><p align="justify">The scholar, authority-referee, Martyr Sayyid Abdel-Sahib al-Hakim, to name only a few.
 
<i><b></b></i></p><p><i><b>A GREAT ADMINISTRATOR</b></i></p><p align="justify">
Imam Al-khoei kept in touch with his followers world-wide through a very well organised
and centralised network of representatives. The latter have been charged with duties such
as: making sure that the social, educational, theological, cultural and even financial
problems of their respective communities are properly addressed and solved. He proved his
administrative genius in handling the financial aspect of running such a huge and
intricate network of charitable trusts overseen and supervised by the Al-khoei Foundation
which has been building schools and religious and cultural centres wherever there is a
sizeable following community. 
</p><p align="justify">During the Afghani struggle against the Russians, Ayatullah  Al-khoei organised
aid for Afghani war victims. When natural disasters hit Bangladesh, India, Kashmir
(chopped off into Pakistani and Indian slices), and Iran, Al-khoei issued orders to spend
generously on the victims of these disasters regardless of their schools of Muslim law.
Moreover, he was credited with the task of establishing projects to dig wells and
irrigation canals for the believers who live in isolated villages in East Africa and the
Indo-Pakistani subcontinent, for undertaking numerous housing projects, schools and both
mobile and permanent clinics, all funded by voluntary contributions from the Shi'a
faithful under his supervision and administrative guidance. 
</p><p><em><strong>HIS ASCETICISM</strong></em><br>
Ayatullah al-Uthma Al-khoei was the embodiment of asceticism, scholarship, and
renunciation of worldly riches. His son narrates anecdotes about the simple life his holy
father used to lead. He says that his father never deducted his own share of the religious
taxes his representatives were collecting on his behalf; instead, he used to spend on his
family, relatives and friends from whatever gifts handed to him by some of his followers.
"My father," says his son, "never bought himself a new outfit except after
the one he wears is totally worn out. Some of those who were very close to him criticised
him for wearing such shabby clothes, telling him that it did not fit his status as the
supreme leader of the faithful to dress like that. His answer to them was that as long as
the outfit he was wearing was clean, there was nothing wrong with its being old. Some even
suggested to him to give his worn-out clothes to others and replace them with new
ones." 
</p><p align="justify">He was also passionate about seeking knowledge and sharing it with others. When his
health deteriorated prior to his demise, and he was hospitalised, his medical team advised
him to do something to entertain himself. He told them that reading always made him
relaxed while lecturing was the only entertainment he had ever known. He used to wake up
before sunrise, make tahajjud, perform his morning prayers, then eat his breakfast with
his family. His breakfast most often was no more than a piece of bread, some domestic
cheese, and a tiny cup of tea, and he never ate by himself. Instead, he insisted on eating
with other members of his family or those who helped them at home, or with his guests.
Before midnight, he used to read a book, then listen to world news, tuning to local, Arab
or international stations. He was often seen the next morning with blackness around his
eyes. The sage could not sleep because of hearing some disturbing news about what was
happening to the Muslims in this country or that. 
<i><b></b></i></p><p><i><b>THE IMAM AT HOME</b></i></p><p align="justify">
His son says the following about his father, "My father was always smiling when he
was with us. He always arbitrated between his sons whenever there was a dispute, and he
was quite witty. If he saw one looking forlorn or happily excited, he would ask him about
the reason, and every evening he would distribute candy for the children in addition to
whatever other gifts he had received that day from the admiring faithful." Despite
his extremely lofty status, he never hesitated to help his family in domestic chores,
including kitchen chores. He never opened the mail coming to any of his family members.
One of his sons told him once that nobody in the house had any secret to hide from him,
and that it was perfectly alright with them if he opened their mail, but he insisted never
to do so. He always instructed members of his family to deliver funds for highly esteemed
but impoverished families without doing so publicly, telling them to help those whom the
ignorant ones mistake as wealthy because of their abstention from begging for help. 
</p><p><em><strong>IMAM'S DEMISE</strong></em></p><p>
After the failure of the Intifada of March 1991, the Grand Ayatullah was briefly
imprisoned then forced to appear on television with the Butcher of Baghdad Saddam Hussein
who always kept pressuring him to issue fatawa, religious verdicts, supportive of Saddam
and his government, something which he never did despite all the persecution to which he,
his representatives and family members were subjected. 
</p><p align="justify">Because of refusing to co-operate with the dictatorial government of Saddam Hussein, he
was put under house arrest till his death. Saddam also exiled, jailed, or assassinated
many of the gifted students, representatives and distinguished followers of Al-khoei and
ordered the destruction of their mosques and libraries particularly those in Najaf and
Karbala. As if the Iraqi government predicted the death of Al-khoei, it cut off all
telephone connections with his Kufa residence in the morning of Saturday, August 8, 1992
and with the houses of those who were close to him. Having performed the afternoon prayers
that day, the health of his late holiness suddenly deteriorated and a severe chest
swelling was visible. Doctors in the medical team charged with supervising his health
conditions was called in, but they could not tend to him early enough. He informed his
family and those in his presence that last night he felt that it was the last night he was
spending with his family. He asked for water to perform his ablution, and as soon as he
finished his ablution his soul passed away to its Maker exactly at 3:13 pm. 
</p><p align="justify">Throngs of the believers started pouring into Kufa, surrounding his residence, and it
was not long before the whole country came to know about the sad news. Military units of
Saddam's "Special Forces" moved quickly to close all highways leading to both
Najaf and Kufa as well as other cities in Iraq's central regions, then they moved to
disperse the thronging crowds in the pretext of making preparations for the Grand
Ayatullah's funeral the next morning. Curfew was enforced in the cities of Najaf, Kufa and
other central cities, and heavily armed police and military units started patrolling the
streets. 
</p><p align="justify">Armed forces stationed at Baghdad and in central and southern Iraqi cities were all
placed under maximum alert in anticipation of a popular reaction to the sad news and to
the ambiguous way it happened and was handled by the Iraqi government. Patrol vehicles
were visible throughout the streets of al-Thawarah, al-Shu'lah and al-Kazimiyyah, all of
which are major Shi'a towns in metropolitan Baghdad. Iraq's radio and television stations
suspended their usual programs to announce the sad news of the demise of the great leader,
informing the public that his funeral services were scheduled for Sunday morning. At
midnight on Saturday, however, the family of the deceased was ordered to bury the Imam
before sunrise. Local government authorities prohibited the public in Najaf and Kufa from
taking part in his funeral services, angering the faithful in Iraq and the world. His body
was washed Saturday evening at his Kufa house in the presence of a handful of his family
members, and the funeral prayers were conducted by his eminence Ayatullah Ali al-Seestani,
one of his closest aides and a member of his four-member juristic Shura (Consultative)
Committee. (The other three members have been: Ayatullah Shaikh Murtada al-Burujardi,
Ayatullah Shaikh Ali Azghar al-Ahmadi, and, of course, Ayatullah al-Uthma Al-khoei
himself.) 
</p><p align="justify">A three-day mourning period was announced by the government which prohibited the family
of the deceased dignitary from holding the traditional Fatiha majlis, while the Ministry
of Awqaf (Islamic Trusts) declared that it would conduct such majalis for his soul.
Telephone connections between the cities of Kufa and Najaf and the rest of the world were
by now cut off, too, till Sunday evening. The hypocritical news media of the Butcher of
Baghdad Saddam Hussein was busy circulating lies about the demise of Imam Al-khoei,
claiming that he had received a great funeral service wherein the people and
representatives of the Iraqi government participated, that his corpse was carried around
all religious sites in the area, and even calling him "the martyr of the nation and
the country." Baghdad's official newspaper Al-Jumhuriyyah called him "the martyr
of Islam and the nation," publishing his photograph on its front page. 
</p><p align="justify">International news agencies, on the other hand, published photographs of his coffin
escorted by no more than six persons. Shortly before his death, the greatest scholar and
leader Al-khoei expressed no concern about anything in this vanishing life more than the
possibility of the loss of his precious manuscripts the writing of which had exhausted so
many years of his life... Surely the Islamic world will find it very hard to compensate
for the loss of such a man, nay, a legendary institute and a lighthouse of knowledge and
scholarship.
