</font></p><p><font size="5" face="Arial" color="red">by Sayyed Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr</font>
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="90%">
<p><table border="5" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" width="90%"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="JUSTIFY">So now, what is a duty of a Shi'ite? What

responsibilities does he have?

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Truly, are we reckoned among the real followers of His

Eminence (Imam al-Mahdi)?

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">If we study the lives of the devout Shi'ites

(followers) of the Holy Imams before the Twelfth Imam,

and consider their sacrifices without the slightest

hesitation, we shall at once awake from our neglectful

slumber and realize our weakness and guilt.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Were not Salman al-Farisi, Abu Dharr al-Ghifari,

'Ammar ibn Yasir and Malik al-Ashtar the followers of the

contemporary Imam 'Ali, Amir al-mu'minin (a), and are

we too the followers of the Imam of our Age?

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Was not Maytham at-Tammar, who did not cease to praise

'Ali, the Lord of the faithful, a follower of His

Eminence 'Ali, and are we too, who are passing with the

Imam of our Age through a strange period, the followers

of His Eminence?

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Were not the martyrs of Karbala', who with love

strived in the way of defending the Imam of their time,

Husayn (a), and were martyred, the followers of His

Eminence, and are we too, who refuse to give our wealth,

lives and other means in the way of the Imam of our time,

His Eminence's followers?

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Is a person like Hisham ibn Hakam, who in his

extraordinary and valuable debates crushed and defamed

the opponents of the Divine Leadership (Imamate) in such

a way that he was called the "assistant of the

Imam" by Imam al-Sadiq (a), a Shi'ite? And are we

too, who are sluggish in fulfilling our foremost duty to

recognize the Imam of our time, Shi'ites?

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">From what we read of the glad tidings in the Qur'an

and the traditions of the Holy Prophet (s) and the infallible

Imams (a), the Imam of the Age (<i>Imam-e Zaman</i>) has

special responsibilities which other Imams did not have. <i>Imam-e

Zaman</i> will establish a Universal Government. He will

fill the earth with righteousness and justice. He will

exploit the earth's treasures and natural resources. He

will improve and develop the land, and in this way

people's awareness and understanding will improve.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Therefore, do not the followers of His Eminence have a

very particular duty? Should not the Shi'ites endeavour

to obtain the competence and merit of being His

Eminence's special companions when he reappears by Divine

Command?

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Therefore, let us see what our duties are and how we

should observe them. Undoubtedly, our first duty is to

become acquainted with him.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Recognizing <i>Imam-e Zaman</i> is so important and

essential that in the Holy Prophet's (s) traditions we read:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"He who dies without recognizing the Imam of his

age is like one who had died during the <i>jahiliyyah</i>

(the pagan era before the advent of Islam)."
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">To die during the <i>jahiliyyah</i> means a death

devoid of Islam and faith. And it is obvious that one who

dies without recognizing the Imam of his age is counted

in the group of the faithless.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In another tradition, Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (a) is

quoted as having said on the same subject :

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"One who dies without having (accepted) the Imam,

it is as if he died in the <i>jahiliyyah</i>, and people

are not exempted from recognizing their Imam."
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Therefore, we must endeavour to recognize His Eminence

(<i>Imam-e Zaman</i>) for the sake of Islam and our

faith, and so that we may be reckoned among those who

have gained salvation and among the faithful.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Another duty of the Shi'ites during the major

occultation, which the Holy Imam have alluded to, is the

question of being ready for the Saviour Hence, the first

step for salvation is to recognize the Imam of the age;

and the second step is to be prepared for the

establishment of just Government by His Eminence.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">One who is waiting (<i>muntazir</i>) and preparing

himself for the appearance of the Imam must have the

characters and merits of the companions of Imam al-Mahdi

(a), and should sacrifice his life and wealth in his

way. For this reason, Imam as- Sadiq (a) said:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"One who waits for our commands is like a person

who sacrifices his own blood in the way of Allah."
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Yes, he who is really ready for the <i>Imamu 'l-'Asr</i>

(the Imam of the Period) becomes like a martyr in the way

of Allah.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In another tradition, the same Imam told some of his

followers about the person who is really waiting for <i>the

Imam-e Zaman</i>, saying:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"One who dies while expecting the Government of <i>al-Qa'im</i>
is like one who is in the presence of <i>al-Qa'im</i> (Imam al-Mahdi)."
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">After a pause he added:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"But he is like one who has been struck with a

sword while accompanying him."
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Then he insisted further by adding:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"Nay, by Allah! He is like one who has been

martyred in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (s)."
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Are we reckoned among those who are expecting His

Eminence? Are we at least waiting for the Divine Promise

of the Authority of Allah (<i>Waliyyu 'llah</i>) in the

same manner as we wait for the return of our loved ones

from a journey?

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In another tradition, Imam as-Sadiq (a) narrated

the virtues of the companions of Imam al-Mahdi (a)

saying:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"If one takes pleasure in being among the

companions of <i>al-Qa'im</i>, then he must wait for him

and must act with good behaviour and modestly. If he dies

before the appearance of <i>al-Qa'im</i>, then he will be

rewarded like one who has followed him. Then act

diligently, and await, that this effort and awaiting will

give you delight, O' you who have found salvation."
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">So, one who is awaiting and has not ceased from good

and worthy deeds should earnestly endeavour to be in an

excellent and worthy position in such a way that Allah

may shower His blessings on him.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">So, we should pray to Allah that He may include us

among those who are waiting for the Imam of the age, and

that our acts and conduct may also symbolize the truth of

our claim. Firstly, we should acquaint ourselves with His

Eminence, the Imam, and then we should guide others, his

opponents and enemies. We should gain the virtues of the

companions of Imam al-Mahdi (a), and should always be

in the expectation of his appearance Henceforth, we will

be able to sacrifice our worthless souls and thus to make

them worthy.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Shi'ites must have a devout link with His Eminence

during the occultation.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Their hearts and souls should be filled with love and

affection for him.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Their thoughts should be devoted to his service and

their desire should be to meet him.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Their prayers should be to ask for the blessing of

Allah to be showered on His Eminence, and their

supplication should be for salvation.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Their existence should be one welded and fused unit,

and their life should blaze with love for him
