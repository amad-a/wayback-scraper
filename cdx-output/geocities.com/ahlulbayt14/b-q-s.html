<p>THE BIBLE, THE QURAN AND SCIENCE
</p></b></font><p><font size="5"><b>by Dr. Maurice Bucaille, a French surgeon</b></font></p></center>
<p></p><hr>
<p align="justify">This book is highly recommended to all
Muslims, especially Muslims who are involved in Dawat.
The book was published by American Trust
Publications in 1979. Dr. Bucaille says that as an educated
person with a scientific mind, it is very hard to believe in a
holy book with the word of God being the ultimate source of
knowledge if the holy book contradicts modern science. With that
in mind, he concludes that the Holy Quran is the word of God
untampered by humans and not contradicting science. In the case
of the old testament or new testament, the human modification has
made it scientifically unacceptable. To prove his point, he is
giving the following examples:
</p><p align="justify">1. Creation of the world: Genesis 1:1: The world was created
in 6 days, light was created on the first day and the sun was
created on the 4th day. This is scientifically incorrect.
</p><p>The Quran says that God created the world in 6 periods.
</p><p align="justify">2. Genesis 1:7 indicates on the first day water was created
everywhere and God separated the waters with firmament into
heaven and earth on Day 2. This is scientifically incorrect. At
the beginning, the whole world was a gaseous mass and was then
divided and cooled off (big bang hypothesis).
</p><p>The Quran says the world was a gaseous mass before it was divided up.
</p><p align="justify">3. Genesis 1:13 states God created vegetables on the third day and the sun was created on the 4th day. 
</p><p align="justify">It is not scientifically acceptable to have vegetables survive without the sun.
</p><p align="justify">4. In the Jewish calendar, the year of creation is 5755. This
is based on the date that Prophet Adam came to earth (Genesis 4:1) and the world was created.
</p><p align="justify">This is not scientifically correct. The world was created millions of years ago as were the humans on earth. 
</p><p align="justify">5. The story of the flood - Genesis 6:7. The Bible indicates
that the big flood 4000 years ago was universal and the whole
world was destroyed except for Prophet Noah and his arc. This is
not scientifically possible and historically is not correct.
Other nations existed 4000 years ago and were not affected by the flood.
</p><p align="justify">The Quran indicates that the flood was a local event and not a worldwide flood.
</p><p align="justify">Dr. Bucaille calls the Bible "the memories of the
apostles". Mathew was a customs officer who wrote his
memories of Jesus, Mark was an eyewitness to Jesus' life, Luke
was a physician who wrote about Jesus. John was very close to
Jesus and wrote his memory, and Paul who wrote his letters in 50
A.D., was a supporter of separating Christianity from Judaism.
Paul did not know Jesus when Jesus was alive, but saw Jesus'
spirit when he was going to Damascus. Paul wrote major portions
of the Bible and advocated that male Christians may not be
circumcised and may eat pork in order to be different from the
Jews. He promoted many differences that exist between Jews and
Christians. The 4 gospels were produced 70-110 years after Jesus'
death. The description of various events are different in the 4 gospels indicating human error.
</p><p align="justify">6. The genealogy of Jesus, according to Mathew and the old
testament, indicates that Abraham lived in 1850 B.C., and from
Abraham to prophet Adam the first man was 20 generations of man.
</p><p align="justify">This is scientifically incorrect. From the first man to
Prophet Abraham, there were probably millions of years and
millions of generations.
</p><p align="justify">7. Dr. Bucaille points out, with reference, many
contradictions between the 4 gospels and Paul's letters on
important events like Jesus' death, resurrection, ascension, and the last super (pages 82-102).
</p><p align="justify">Dr. Bucaille then examines the Quran by the same standards and
points out various miracles of the Quran. He concludes that the
Quran is the only Holy Book that is the word of God in total,
unaltered by human hands and preserved in its original language
and text, and could not have been written by the Prophet Mohammad
(s) without revelation from God. God through the Angel
Gebrael, revealed the Quran to Prophet Mohammad (s) piece by
piece over a 23 year period. As Prophet was uttering revealed
portions, his companions wrote it down. It then was put together
a few years after the Prophet's death into its existing format.
One of the original copies of the Quran compiled by Khalifah
Othman still exists in its original form in the Istanbul Museum in Turkey.
