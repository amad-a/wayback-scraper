<p><b><font color="red" size="8">The Islam</font></b></p></center>
<p></p><hr noshade="" width="85%">
<p align="justify"><b><font color="blue" size="5">Imam Ali said:</font></b>

</p><p>Have you fully realised what Islam is ?

</p><p align="justify">It is indeed a religion founded on truth. It is such a
fountain-head of learning that several streams of wisdom and knowledge flow from it. It is such a
lamp that several lamps will be lit from it. It is a lofty beacon of light Illuminating the path of Allah. It
is such a set of principles and beliefs that will fully satisfy every seeker of truth and reality Know you
all that Allah has made Islam, the most sublime path for the attainment of his supreme pleasure and
the highest standard of his worship and obedience. He has favoured it with noble precepts, exalted
principles, undoubtable arguments, unchallengeable supremecy and undeniable wisdom. It is up to
you to maintain the eminence and dignity granted to it by the Lord, to follow it sincerely, to do
justice to its articles of faith and belief, to obey implicitly its tenets and orders and to give it the
proper place in your lives. 

</p><p></p><hr noshade="" width="85%">

<p align="justify">This Islam is the religion which Allah has chosen for Himself, developed it before His eyes, preferred
it as the best among His creations, established its pillars on His love. He has disgraced other
religions by giving honour to it. He has humiliated all communities before its sublimity; He has
humbled its enemies with His kindness and made its opponents lonely by according it His support.
He has smashed the pillars of misguidance with its columns. He has quenched the thirst of the thirsty
from its cisterns, and filled the cisterns through those who draw its water. 

</p><p align="justify">He made Islam such that its constituent parts cannot break, its links cannot separate, its construction
cannot fall, its columns cannot decay, its plant cannot be uprooted, its time does not end, its laws do
not expire, its twigs cannot be cut, its parts do not become narrow, its ease does not change into
difficulty, its clarity is not affected by gloom, its straightness does not acquire curvature, its wood has
no crookedness, its vast paths have no narrowness, its lamp knows no putting off and its sweetness
has no bitterness. 

</p><p align="justify">It consists of columns whose bases Allah has fixed in truthfulness and whose foundation He has
strengthened, and of sources whose streams are ever full of water and of lamps, whose flames are
full of light, and of beacons with whose help travellers get guidance, and of signs through which a
way is found to its highways and of watering places which provide water to those who come to
them. Allah has placed in Islam the height of His pleasure, the pinnacle of His pillars and the
prominence of His obedience. Before Allah, therefore, its columns are strong, its construction is
lofty, its proofs are bright, its fires are aflame, its authority is strong, its beacons are high and its
destruction is difficult. You should therefore honour it, follow it, fulfil its obligations and accord the
position due to it.
