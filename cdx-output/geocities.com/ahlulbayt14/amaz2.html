<p align="justify">I had the pleasure of interviewing Dr. Keith Moore for a television
presentation, and we talked a great deal about this - it was illustrated
by slides and so on. He mentioned that some of the things that the Quran
states about the growth of the human being were not known until thirty
years ago. In fact, he said that one item in particular - the Quran's
description of the human being as a "leech-like clot" ('alaqah) at one
stage - was new to him; but when he checked on it, he found that it was
true, and so he added it to his book. He said, "I never thought of that
before," and he went to the zoology department and asked for a picture
of a leech. When he found that it looked just like the human embryo, he
decided to include both pictures in one of his textbooks. Dr. Moore also
wrote a book on clinical embryology, and when he presented this information
in Toronto, it caused quite a stir throughout Canada. It was on the front
pages of some of the newspapers across Canada, and some of the headlines
were quite funny. For instance, one headline read: "SURPRISING THING FOUND
IN ANCIENT BOOK!"! It seems obvious from this example that people do not
clearly understand what it is all about. As a matter of fact, one newspaper
reporter asked Professor Moore, "Don't you think That maybe the Arabs might
have known about these things - the description of the embryo, its appearance
and how it changes and grows? Maybe there were not scientists, but maybe
they did something crude dissections on their own - carved up people and
examined these things."

</p><p align="justify">The professor immediately pointed out to him that he [i.e., the reporter]
had missed a very important point - all of the slides of the embryo that
had been shown and had been projected in the film had come from pictures
taken through a microscope. He said, "It does not matter if someone had
tried to discover embryology fourteen centuries ago, they could not have
seen it!". All of the descriptions in the Quran of the appearance of the
embryo are of the item when it is still too small to see with the eye;
therefore, one needs a microscope to see it. Since such a device had only
been around for little more than two hundred years, Dr. Moore taunted,
"Maybe fourteen centuries ago someone secretly had a microscope and did
this research, making no mistakes anywhere. Then he somehow taught Muhammad
and convinced him to put this information in his book. Then he destroyed
his equipment and kept it a secret forever. Do you believe that? You really
should not unless you bring some proof because it is such a ridiculous
theory." In fact, when he was asked "How do you explain this information
in the Quran?" Dr. Moore's reply was, "It could only have been divinely
revealed."!

</p><p align="justify">Although the aforementioned example of man researching information contained
in the Quran deals with a non-Muslim, it is still valid because he is
one of those who is knowledgeable in the subject being researched. Had
some layman claimed that what the Quran says about embryology is true,
then one would not necessarily have to accept his word. However, because
of the high position, respect, and esteem man gives scholars, one naturally
assumes that if they research a subject and arrive at a conclusion based
on that research, then the conclusion is valid. One of Professor Moore's
colleagues, Marshall Johnson, deals extensively with geology at the University
of Toronto.

</p><p align="justify">He became very interested in the fact that the Quran's statements about
embryology are accurate, and so he asked Muslims to collect everything
contained in the Quran which deals with his specialty. Again people were
very surprised at the findings. Since there are a vast number subjects
discussed in the Quran, it would certainly require a large amount of time
to exhaust each subject. It suffices for the purpose of this discussion
to state that the Quran makes very clear and concise statements about
various subjects while simultaneously advising the reader to verify the
authenticity of these statements with research by scholars in those subjects.
And as illustrated by the Quran has clearly emerged authentic. Undoubtedly,
there is an attitude in the Quran which is not found anywhere else. It
is interesting how when the Quran provides information, it often tells
the reader, "You did not know this before." Indeed, there is no scripture
that exists which makes that claim. All of the other ancient writings and
scriptures that people have, do give a lot of information, but they always
state where the information came from.

</p><p align="justify">For example, when the Bible discusses ancient history, it states that
this king lived here, this one fought in a certain battle, another one
had so may sons, etc. Yet it always stipulates that if you want more information,
then you should read the book of so and so because that is where the information
came from. In contrast to this concept, the Quran provides the reader
with information and states that this information is something new. Of
course, there always exists the advice to research the information provided
and verify its authenticity. It is interesting that such a concept was
never challenged by non-Muslims fourteen centuries ago. Indeed, the Makkans
who hated the Muslims, and time and time again they heard such revelations
claiming to bring new information; yet, they never spoke up and said, "This
is not new. We know where Muhammad got this information. We learned this
at school."

</p><p align="justify">They could never challenge its authenticity because it really was new!
In concurrence with the advice given in the Quran to research information
(even if it is new), when 'Umar was caliph, he chose a group of men and
sent them to find the wall of Dhul-Qarnayn. Before the Quranic revelation,
the Arabs had never heard of such a wall, but because the Quran described
it, they were able to discover it. As a matter of fact, it is now located
in what is called Durbend in the Soviet Union. It must be stressed here
that the Quran is accurate about many, many things, but accuracy does
not necessarily mean that a book is a divine revelation. In fact, accuracy
is only one of the criteria for divine revelations.

</p><p align="justify">For instance, the telephone book is accurate, but that does not mean
that it is divinely revealed. The real problem lies in that one must establish
some proof of the source the Quran's information. The emphasis is on the
reader. One cannot simply deny the Quran's authenticity without sufficient
proof. If, indeed, one finds a mistake, then he has the right to disqualify
it. This is exactly what the Quran encourages. Once a man came up to me
after a lecture I delivered in South Africa. He was very angry about what
I had said, and so he claimed, "I am going to go home tonight and find
a mistake in the Quran." Of course, I said, "Congratulations. That is
the most intelligent thing that you have said." Certainly, this is the
approach Muslims need to take with those who doubt the Quran's authenticity,
because the Quran itself offers the same challenge. An inevitably, after
accepting it's challenge and discovering that it is true, these people
will come to believe it because they could not disqualify it. In essence,
the Quran earns their respect because they themselves have had to verify
its authenticity. An essential fact that cannot be reiterated enough concerning
the authenticity of the Quran is that one's inability to explain a phenomenon
himself does not require his acceptance of the phenomenon's existence or
another person's explanation of it.

</p><p align="justify">Specifically, just because one cannot explain something does not mean
that one has to accept someone else's explanation. However, the person's
refusal of other explanations reverts the burden of proof back on himself
to find a feasible answer. This general theory applies to numerous concepts
in life, but fits most wonderfully with the Quranic challenge, for it
creates a difficulty for one who says, "I do not believe it." At the onset
of refusal one immediately has an obligation to find an explanation himself
if he feels others' answers are inadequate. In fact, in one particular
Quranic verse which I have always seen mistranslated into English, Allah
mentions a man who heard the truth explained to him. It states that he
was derelict in his duty because after he heard the information, he left
without checking the verity of what he had heard. In other words, one is
guilty if he hears something and does not research it and check to see
whether it is true. One is supposed to process all information and decide
what is garbage to be thrown out and what is worthwhile information to
be kept and benefited from at a later date. One cannot just let it rattle
around in his head. It must be put in the proper categories and approached
from that point of view. For example, if the information is still speculatory,
then one must discern whether it's closer to being true or false. But if
all of the facts have been presented, then one must decide absolutely between
these two options. And even if one is not positive about the authenticity
of the information, he is still required to process all of the information
and make the admission that he just does not know for sure. Although this
last point appears to be futile, in actuality, it is beneficial to the
arrival at a positive conclusion at a later time in that it forces the
person to at least recognize, research and review the facts. This familiarity
with the information will give the person "the edge" when future discoveries
are made and additional information is presented. The important thing is
that one deals with the facts and does not simply discard them out of empathy
and disinterest.

</p><p align="justify">The real certainty about the truthfulness of the Quran is evident in
the confidence which is prevalent throughout it; and this confidence comes
from a different approach - "Exhausting the Alternatives." In essence,
the Quran states, "This book is a divine revelation; if you do not believe
that, then what is it?" In other words, the reader is challenged to come
up with some other explanation. Here is a book made of paper and ink. Where
did it come from? It says it is a divine revelation; if it is not, then
what is its source? The interesting fact is that no one has with an explanation
that works. In fact, all alternatives have bee exhausted. As has been well
established by non-Muslims, these alternatives basically are reduces to
two mutually exclusive schools of thought, insisting on one or the other.
On one hand, there exists a large group of people who have researched the
Quran for hundreds of years and who claim, "One thing we know for sure
- that man, Muhammad, thought he was a prophet. He was crazy!" They are
convinced that Muhammad (s) was fooled somehow. Then on the other hand,
there is another group which alleges, "Because of this evidence, one thing
we know for sure is that that man, Muhammad, was a liar!" Ironically, these
two groups never seem to get together without contradicting. In fact, many
references on Islam usually claim both theories. They start out by saying
that Muhammad (s) was crazy and then end by saying that he was a liar.
They never seem to realize that he could not have been both!

</p><p align="justify">For example, if one is deluded and really thinks that he is a prophet,
then he does not sit up late at night planning, "How will I fool the people
tomorrow so that they think I am a prophet?" He truly believes that he
is a prophet, and he trusts that the answer will be given to him by revelation.
As a matter of fact, a great deal of the Quran came in answer to questions.
Someone would ask Muhammad (s) a question, and the revelation would come
with the answer to it. Certainly, if one is crazy and believes that an
angel put words in his ear, then when someone asks him a question, he thinks
that the angel will give him the answer. Because he is crazy, he really
thinks that. He does not tell someone to wait a short while and then run
to his friends and ask them, "Does anyone know the answer?" This type of
behavior is characteristic of one who does not believe that he is a prophet.
What the non-Muslims refuse to accept is that you cannot have it both ways.
One can be deluded, or he can be a liar. He can be either one or neither,
but he certainly cannot be both! The emphasis is on the fact that they
are unquestionably mutually exclusive personal traits.

</p><p align="justify">The following scenario is a good example of the kind of circle that
non-Muslims go around in constantly. If you ask one of them, "What is the
origin of the Quran?" He tells you that it originated from the mind of
a man who was crazy. Then you ask him, "If it came from his head, then
where did he get the information contained in it? Certainly the Quran
mentions many things with which the Arabs were not familiar." So in order
to explain the fact which you bring him, he changes his position and says,
"Well, maybe he was not crazy. Maybe some foreigner brought him the information.
So he lied and told people that he was a prophet." At this point then you
have to ask him, "If Muhammad was a liar, then where did he get his confidence?
Why did he behave as though he really thought he was a prophet?" Finally
backed into a corner, like a cat he quickly lashes out with the first response
that comes to his mind. Forgetting that he has already exhausted that possibility,
he claims, "Well, maybe he wasn't a liar. He was probably crazy and really
thought that he was a prophet." And thus he begins the futile circle again.
