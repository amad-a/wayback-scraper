<p align="justify">During the month of July, 1951 a team of Russian experts,
were surveying the valley of Kaat. Perhaps they were busy in finding out a 
new mine. They noticed a few pieces of rotten wood at a place. The 
group officer started digging the place. To his surprise he found 
heaps of wood pressed there under the earth. Experts, by observing a 
few layers speculated that these wood are extraordinary and possess an obscure mystery.
</p><p align="justify">They excavated the place with deep interest. They found quite a good 
amount of wood and many other things. They also found a long 
rectangular wooden plate. The experts were surprised to observe that 
this particular plate measuring 14" by 10" was in far better 
condition among other wood which were on the verge of decomposition, due to aging.
</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p align="justify">After investigation at the end of 1952, experts came to the 
conclusion that this particular place belonged to the Noah's Ark 
which had rested on the peak of mount Calff (Judy, Turkey). And 
the plate on which a few words of some ancient language were 
inscribed, was fixed on the Ark. </p><p align="justify"> 
After it was proved that the wood found in the excavation was that of 
the Noah's Ark, the curiosity as to what is written on the wooden 
plate was aroused. A board of experts was appointed by the Russian 
Government under it's research Department to investigate the 
language of the wooden plate. The board started its work from 27th 
February, 1953. Following were the members of this board:
</p><ol>
<li>Prof. Solonon, Macow University. 
</li><li>Prof. Ifa Han Kheeno, Lu Lu Han College China.  
</li><li>Mr. Mishaou Lu Farug, officer l/C fossils.  
</li><li>Mr. Taumol Goru, Teacher, Cafezud College. 
</li><li>Prof. De Pakan, Lenin Institute. 
</li><li>Mr. M. Ahmed Colad,Zitcomen Research Association .  
</li><li>Major Cottor, Stalin College.  
</li></ol>
<p align="justify"> So these seven experts after eight months of research came to the
conclusion that this plate was of the wood used in making Noah's Ark 
and that the Prophet Noah had put this plate on his Ark for the safety 
of the Ark and for receiving favour of Allah.
</p><p align="justify"> In the centre of the plate, there is a drawing of palm shape on  which 
some words of ancient Saamaani language are written. </p><p align="justify"> 
Mr. N. F. Max, expert, ancient languages, Britain (Manchester) has 
translated the words written on the wooden plate, in English as 
follows: </p><p align="justify"> 
<font color="red">"<b>O My God, My helper Keep my hand with mercy, and with your Holy 
bodies, Mohammad, Ali, Shabbar, Shabbir, Fatma. They are all biggest 
and honourable. The world established for them. Help me by their 
names. You can return to right.</b>"</font></p><p align="justify"> 
People were surprised to learn these writings. They were surprised as 
to how this particular plate after centuries of exposition to nature 
did not decompose and maintained its form. The plate is still 
preserved at the Centre of FossiIs Research, Moscow, Russia. </p><p align="justify">
If you ever have a chance to visit Russia, you would be able to see 
the actual plate, and it will increase your faith in Ahlul-Bayt. </p><p align="justify"> 
The translation was documented in the following newspapers:
