<p align="center"><font color="red" size="7"><b>Abu Dhar al-Ghifari</b></font>
</p><p></p><hr noshade="" width="500">
<p align="justify">Abu Dhar al-Ghifari's name was Jundab ibn Junadah.
When he heard about the proclamation
of the Prophet (s), he came to Mecca and after making enquires saw
the Prophet and accepted Islam whereupon the unbelievers of Quraysh
gave him all sorts of troubles and inflicted pain after pain,
but he remained steadfast. Among the acceptors of Islam he is
the third, fourth or fifth. Along with this precedence in Islam
his renunciation and piety was so high that the Holy Prophet (s) said:
</p><p align="justify">Among my people Abu Dhar is the like of `Isa (Jesus) son of Maryam
(Mary) in renunciation and piety. 
</p><p align="justify">In the reign of Caliph Umar, Abu Dhar left for Syria and during
Uthman's reign also remained there. He spent his days in counselling,
preaching, acquainting people with the greatness of the members
of the Prophet's family (Ahlul-Bayt) and guiding the people to the rightful
path. The traces of Shi`ism now found in Syria and Jabal `Amil
(north of Lebanon) are the result of his preaching and activity
and the fruit of seeds sown by him.
</p><p align="justify">The Governor of Syria, Muawiyah, did not like the conduct of
Abu Dhar and was much disgusted with his open criticism and mention
of the money-making and other wrongful activities of Uthman.
But he could do nothing. At last he wrote to Uthman that if he
remained there any longer he would rouse the people against the
Caliph. There should therefore be some remedy against this. On
this, Uthman wrote to him that Abu Dhar should be seated on
an unsaddled camel and dispatched to Medina. The order was obeyed
and Abu Dhar was sent to Medina. On reaching Medina he resumed
his preaching of righteousness and truth. He would recall to the
people the days of the Holy Prophet (s) and refrain them from displays
of kingly pageantry, whereupon Uthman was much perturbed and
tried to restrict his speaking. One day he sent for him and said:
"I have come to know that you go about propagating that the
Holy Prophet (s) said that:
</p><p align="justify">"When Banu Umayyah will become thirty in number they will
regard the cities of Allah as their property, His creatures their
slaves and His religion the tool of their treachery."
</p><p align="justify">Abu Dhar replied that he had heard the Prophet say so. Uthman
said that he was speaking a lie and enquired from those beside
him if any one had heard this tradition and all replied in the
negative. Abu Dhar then said that enquiry should be made from
Amir al-mu'minin Ali ibn Abi Talib. He was sent for
and asked about it. He said it was correct and Abu Dhar was telling
the truth. Uthman enquired on what basis he gave evidence for
the correctness of this tradition. Amir al-mu'minin replied that
he had heard the Holy Prophet (s) said that: 
</p><p align="justify">There is no speaker under the sky or over the earth more truthful
than Abu Dhar.
</p><p align="justify"> Now Uthman could do nothing. If he still held him to be liar
it would mean falsification of the Prophet. He therefore kept
quiet despite much perturbation, since he could not refute him.
On the other side Abu Dhar began speaking against the usurping
of Muslims' property quite openly and whenever he saw Uthman
he would recite this verse:
</p><p align="justify">And those who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in
Allah's way; announce thou unto them a painful chastisement. On
the Day (of Judgement) when it shall be heated in the fire
of hell, then shall be branded with it their foreheads and their
sides and their backs; (saying unto them)"This is
what ye hoarded up for yourselves, taste ye then what ye did hoard
up." (Qur'an, 9:34-35)
</p><p align="justify">Uthman promised him money but could not entrap this free man
in his golden net, then resorted to repression but could not stop
his truth-speaking tongue. At last he ordered him to leave and
go to al-Rabadhah and deputised Marwan, son of the man (al-Hakam)
exiled by the Holy Prophet Mohammad (s), to turn him out of Medina. At the same
time he issued the inhuman order that no one should speak to him
nor see him off. But Amir al-mu'minin, Imam Hasan, Imam Husayn,
Aqil ibn Abi Talib, Abdullah ibn Jafar and Ammar ibn Yasir
did not pay any heed to this order and accompanied him to see
him off, and Amir al-mu'minin uttered 
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Spa/7220/abuzar.html"> 
these sentences </a> on that occasion.
</p><p align="justify"> In al-Rabadhah, Abu Dhar had to put up with a very hard life.
It was here that his son Dhar and his wife died and the sheep
and goats that he was keeping for his livelihood also died. Of
his children only one daughter remained, who equally shared his
starvation and troubles. When the means of subsistence were fully
exhausted and day after day passed without food she said to Abu
Dhar: "Father, how long shall we go on like this. We should
go somewhere in search of livelihood." Abu Dhar took her
with him and set off for the wilderness. He could not find even
any foliage. At last he was tired and sat down at a certain place.
Then he collected some sand and, putting his head on it, lay down.
Soon he began gasping, his eyes rolled up and pangs of death gripped him.
</p><p align="justify">When the daughter saw this condition she was perplexed and said,
"Father, if you die in this vast wilderness, how shall I
manage for your burial quite alone." He replied, "Do
not get upset. The Prophet told me that I shall die in helplessness
and some Iraqis would arrange for my burial. After my death you
put a sheet over me and then sit by the roadway and when some
caravan passes that way tell them that the Prophet's companion
Abu Dhar has died." Consequently, after his death she went
and sat by the roadside. After some time a caravan passed that
way. It included Malik ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar al-Nakha`i, Hujr
ibn `Adi al-Ta'i, `Alqamah ibn Qays al-Nakha`i, Sa`sa`ah
ibn Suhan al-`Abdi, al-Aswad ibn Yazid an-Nakha`i etc. who wer
all fourteen persons in number. When they heard about the passing
away of Abu Dhar they were shocked at his helpless death. They
stopped their riding beasts and postponed the onward journey for
his burial. Ma1ik al-Ashtar gave a sheet of cloth for his shroud.
It was valued at four thousand Dirhams. After his funeral rites
and burial they departed. This happened in the month of Dhi al-hijjah, 32 A.H.
