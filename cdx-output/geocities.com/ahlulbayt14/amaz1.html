<p align="justify">Calling the Quran amazing is not something done only
by Muslims, who have an appreciation for the book and who are pleased with
it; it has been labeled amazing by non-Muslims as well. In fact, even people
who hate Islam very much have still called it amazing.
</p><p align="justify">One thing which surprises non-muslims who are examining the book very
closely is that the Quran does not appear to them to be what they expected.
What they assume is that they have an old book which came fourteen centuries
ago from the Arabian desert; and they expect that the book should look
something like that - an old book from the desert. And then they find out
that it does not resemble what they expected at all. Additionally, one
of the first things that some people assume is that because it is an old
book which comes from the desert, it should talk about the desert. Well
the Quran does talk about the desert - some of its imagery describes the
desert; but it also talks about the sea - what it's like to be in a storm on the sea.
</p><p align="justify">Some years ago, the story came to us in Toronto about a man who was
in the merchant marine and made his living on the sea. A Muslim gave him
a translation of the Quran to read. The merchant marine knew nothing about
the history of Islam but was interested in reading the Quran. When he
finished reading it, he brought it back to the Muslim and asked, "This
Muhammed, was he a sailor?" He was impressed at how accurately the Quran
describes a storm on a sea. When he was told, "No as a matter of fact,
Muhammed lived in the desert," that was enough for him. He embraced Islam
on the spot. He was so impressed with the Quran's description because
he had been in a storm on the sea, and he knew that whoever had written
that description had also been in a storm on the sea. The description of
"a wave, over it a wave, over it clouds" was not what someone imagining
a storm on a sea to be like would have written; rather, it was written
by someone who knew what a storm on the sea was like. This is one example
of how the Quran is not tied to a certain place and time. Certainly, the
scientific ideas expressed in it also do not seem to originate from the
desert fourteen centuries ago.
</p><p align="justify">Many centuries before the onset of Muhammed's Prophethood, there was
a well-known theory of atomism advanced by the Greek philosopher, Democritus.
He and the people who came after him assumed that matter consists of tiny,
indestructible, indivisible particles called atoms. The Arabs too, used
to deal in the same concept; in fact, the Arabic word dharrah commonly
referred to the smallest particle known to man. Now, modern science has
discovered that this smallest unit of matter (i.e., the atom, which has
all of the same properties as its element) can be split into its component
parts. This is a new idea, a development of the last century; yet, interestingly
enough, this information had already been documented in the Quran which
states:
</p><p align="justify">" He [i.e., Allah] is aware of an atom's weight in the heavens and on
the earth and even anything smaller than that..."
</p><p align="justify">Undoubtedly, fourteen centuries ago that statement would have looked
unusual, even to an Arab. For him, the dharrah was the smallest thing there
was. Indeed, this is proof, that the Quran is not outdated.
</p><p align="justify">Another example of what one might expect to find in an"old book" that
touches upon the subject of health or medicine is outdated remedies or
cures. Various historical sources state that the Prophet gave some advice
about health and hygiene, yet most of these pieces of advice are not contained
in the Quran. At first glance, to the non-Muslims this appears to be a
negligent omission. They cannot understand why Allah would not "include"
such helpful information in the Quran. Some Muslims attempt to explain
this absence with the following argument: "Although the Prophet's advice
was sound and applicable to the time in which he lived, Allah, in His infinite
wisdom, knew that there would come later medical and scientific advances
which would make the Prophet's advice appear outdated. When later discoveries
occurred, people might say that such information contradicted that which
the Prophet had given. Thus, since Allah would never allow any opportunity
for the non-Muslims to claim that the Quran contradicts itself or the
teachings of the Prophet, He only included in the Quran information and
examples which could stand the test of time."

</p><p align="justify">However, when one examines the true realities of the Quran in terms
of its existence as a divine revelation, the entire matter is quickly brought
into its proper perspective, and the error in such argumentation becomes
clear and understandable. It must be understood that the Quran is a divine
revelation, and as such, all information in it is of divine origin. Allah
revealed the Quran from Himself. It is the words of Allah, which existed
before creation, and thus nothing can be added, subtracted or altered.
In essence, the Quran existed and was complete before the creation of
Prophet Muhammed, so it could not possibly contain any of the Prophet's
own words or advice. An inclusion of such information would clearly contradict
the purpose for which the Quran exists, compromise its authority and render
it inauthentic as a divine revelation.

</p><p align="justify">Consequently, there was no "home remedies" in the Quran which one could
claim to be outdated; nor does it contain any man's view about what is
beneficial to health, what food is best to eat, or what will cure this
or that disease. In fact, the Quran only mentions one item dealing with
medical treatment, and it is not in dispute by anyone. It states that in
honey there is healing. And certainly, I do not think that there is anyone
who will argue with that!

</p><p align="justify">If one assumes that the Quran is the product of a man's mind, then
one would expect it to reflect some of what was going on in the mind of
the man who "composed" it. In fact, certain encyclopedias and various books
clam that the Quran was the product of hallucinations that Muhammed underwent.
If these claims are true - if it indeed originated from some psychological
problems in Muhammed's mind - then evidence of this would be apparent in
the Quran. Is there such evidence? In order to determine whether or not
there is, one must first identify what things would have been going on
in his mind at that time and then search for these thoughts and reflections
in the Quran.

</p><p align="justify">It is common knowledge that Muhammad had a very difficult life. All
of his daughters died before him except one, and he had a wife of several
years who was dear and important to him, who not only proceeded him in
death at a very critical period of his life. As a matter of fact, she must
have been quite a woman because when the first revelation came to him,
he ran home to her afraid. Certainly, even today one would have a hard
time trying to find an Arab who would tell you, "I was so afraid that I
ran home to my wife." They just aren't that way. Yet Muhammed felt comfortable
enough with his wife to be able to do that. That's how influential and
strong woman she was. Although these examples are only a few of the subjects
that would have been on Muhammed's mind, they are sufficient in intensity
to prove my point. The Quran does not mention any of these things - not
the death of his children, not the death of his beloved companion and wife,
not his fear of the initial revelations, which he so beautifully shared
with his wife - nothing; yet, these topics must have hurt him, bothered
him, and caused him pain and grief during periods of his psychological
reflections, then these subjects, as well as others, would be prevalent
or at least mentioned throughout.

</p><p align="justify">A truly scientific approach to the Quran is possible because the Quran
offers something that is not offered by other religious scriptures, in
particular, and other religions, in general. It is what scientists demand.
Today there are many people who have ideas and theories about how the universe
works. These people are all over the place, but the scientific community
does not even bother to listen to them. This is because within the last
century the scientific community has demanded a test of falsification.
They say, "If you have theory, do not bother us with it unless you bring
with that theory a way for us to prove whether you are wrong or not."

</p><p align="justify">Such a test was exactly why the scientific community listened to Einstein
towards the beginning of the century. He came with a new theory and said,
"I believe the universe works like this; and here are three ways to prove
whether I am wrong!". So the scientific community subjected his theory
to the tests, and within six years it passed all three. Of course, this
does not prove that he was great, but it proves that he deserved to be
listened to because he said, "This is my idea; and if you want to try to
prove me wrong, do this or try that." This is exactly what the Quran has
- falsification tests. Some are old (in that they have already been proven
true), and some still exist today. Basically it states, "If this book is
not what it claims to be, then all you have to do is this or this or this
to prove that it is false." Of course, in 1400 years no one has been able
to do "This or this or this, " and thus it is still considered true and
authentic. I suggest to you that the next time you get into dispute with
someone about Islam and he claims that he has the truth and that you are
in darkness, you leave all other arguments at first and make this suggestion.
Ask him, "Is there any falsification test in your religion? Is there anything
in your religion that would prove you are wrong if I could prove to you
that it exists - anything?" Well, I can promise right now that people will
not have anything - no test, no proof, nothing! This is because they do
not carry around the idea that they should not only present what they believe
but should also offer others a chance to prove they're wrong. However,
Islam does that. A perfect example of how Islam provides man with a chance
to verify it authenticity and "prove it wrong" occurs in the 4th chapter.
And quiet honestly, I was surprised when I first discovered this challenge.
It states:

</p><p align="justify">"Do they not consider the Quran? Had it been from any other than Allah,
they would surely have found therein much discrepancy."

</p><p align="justify">This is a clear challenge to the non-Muslim.Basically, it invites him
to find a mistake. As a matter of fact, the seriousness and difficulty
of the challenge aside, the actual presentation of such a challenge in
the first place is not even in human nature and is inconsistent with man's
personality. One doesn't take an exam in school after finishing the exam,
write a note to the instructor at the end saying, "This exam is perfect.
There are no mistakes in it. Find one if you can!". One just doesn't do
that. The teacher would not sleep until he found a mistake! And yet this
is the way the Quran approaches people. Another interesting attitude that
exists in the Quran repeatedly deals with its advice to the reader. The
Quran informs that reader about different facts and then gives the advice:
"If you want to know more about this or that, or if you doubt what is said,
then you should ask those who have knowledge." This too is a surprising
attitude. It is not usual to have a book that comes from someone without
training in geography, botany, biology, etc., who discusses these subjects
and then advises the reader to ask men of knowledge if he doubts anything.

</p><p align="justify">Yet in every age there have been Muslims who have followed the advice
of the Quran and made surprising discoveries. If one looks to the works
of Muslim scientists if many centuries ago, one will find them full of
quotations from the Quran. These works state that they did research in
such a place, looking for something. And they affirm that the reason they
looked in such and such a place was that the Quran pointed them in that
direction. For example, the Quran mentions man's origin and then tells
the reader, "Research it!" It gives the reader a hint where to look and
then states that one should find out more about it. This is the kind of
thing that Muslims today largely seem to overlook - but not always, as
illustrated in the following example. A few years ago, a group of men in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia collected all if the verses in the Quran which discuss
embryology - the growth of the human being in the womb. They said, "Here
is what the Quran says. Is it the truth?" In essence, they took the advice
of the Quran: "Ask the men who know." They chose, as it happened, a non-Muslim
who is a professor of embryology at the University of Toronto. His name
is Keith Moore, and he is the author of textbooks on embryology - a world
expert on the subject. They invited him to Riyadh and said, "This is what
the Quran says about your subject. Is it true? What can you tell us?"
While he was in Riyadh, they gave him all of the help that he needed in
translation and all of the cooperation for which he asked. And he was so
surprised at what he found that he changed his textbooks. In fact, in the
second edition of one of his books, called Before we are born... in the
second edition about the history of embryology, he included some material
that was not in the first edition because of what he found in the Quran.
Truly this illustrates that the Quran was ahead of its time and that those
who believe in the Quran know what other people do not know.
