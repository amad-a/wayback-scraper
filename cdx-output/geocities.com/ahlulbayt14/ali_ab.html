<p><b><font color="red" size="8"> AHLUL-BAYT </font></b></p></center>
<p></p><hr noshade="" width="85%">
<p align="justify"><b><font color="blue" size="5">Imam Ali said:</font></b>
</p><p align="justify">By Allah! I have learnt the proclamation of the messages, the fulfillment of promises and perfection
of words. With us, the ahlul-bayt, are the doors of wisdom and the lights of all things. Where are
those who claim that they, instead of us, are deeply rooted in knowledge? They do so lying and
rebelling against us. Allah has elevated us and degraded them, and has bestowed upon us and
deprived them, made us enter and expelled them. It is through us that guidance is sought and
blindness removed. Certainly, the Imams will be from the Quraysh, they have been planted in the
line of Hashim. The Imamate is not right for others, neither is it for the governors to the exclusion of
others. 

</p><p align="justify">We are the close ones and the companions, the treasures and the doors. Houses are not entered
except by their doors; whosoever enters them in any other way is called a thief.

</p><p align="justify">Within them (Ahlul-Bayt) is the nobility of the Quran, and they are the treasures of the
Merciful one. When they speak they utter the truth, and when they are silent, none should speak before they do. 

</p><p align="justify">They are the life of knowledge and death of ignorance; their forbearance tells you of their
knowledge and their silence the wisdom of their speaking. They do not go against the truth nor do
they differ about it. They are the pillars of Islam and the asylums of protection. Through them the
truth has returned to its rightful position, falsehood has vanished and it's tongue severed from it's
root. They have understood religion attentively and carefully, not from hearsay or from relaters,
because the relaters of knowledge are many, but few observe it. 

</p><p align="justify">His (The Holy Prophet) progeny is the best of progenies and his family the best of families. His tree is the best of trees,
grown in sanctity and excelled in generosity, for them are long branches and fruits that cannot be
reached. 

</p><p align="justify">We are the tree of prophethood, the station of divine message and the place where angels visit. We
are the mines of knowledge, the fountain-heads of wisdom. Those who support and love us, can
expect mercy, our enemies and one who hates us, await the wrath [of God]. 

</p><p align="justify">We are the noble ones, and our progeny is the progeny of the Prophets. Our party is the party of
Allah, the most Glorious and Majestic. The rebellious group are the party of Satan. Whoever
equates us with our enemy is not from us". 

</p><p align="justify">Where do you go and how [much] do you lie? The standards are raised and the signs clear. The
minarets have been erected, so where are you wandering? How can you wander blindly, when
among you is the progeny of the Prophet (s) and they are the pillars of truth, standards of
religion, the truthful tongues? Accord to them the same position as you do to the Quran and come
to them as thirsty camels approach water springs. 

</p><p align="justify">O people, take it from the seal of the Prophets (s), that he who dies from amongst us is not
dead, and he who decays from amongst us does not really decay. Do not say what you do not
understand, because most of the truth lies in what you deny. Accept the argument of one against
whom you have no argument. It is me. Did I not act according to the more weighty thing (the
Quran) and did I not leave for you the less weighty thing (the ahlul-bayt of the Prophet) and did I
not fix for you the standard of faith?

</p><p align="justify">Examine the ahlul-bayt of your Prophet and follow their character and footsteps and they will
never lead you astray. They will never make you return to destruction; if they lie down, then you lie
down, and if they arise, then you arise. Do not precede them otherwise you will go astray. Do not
lag behind them as you will be ruined.
