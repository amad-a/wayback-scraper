<p></p><hr noshade="" width="85%">

<p align="justify"> "Lo!God and His Angels shower blessings on the Prophet.O ye who
believe!Ask blessings on him and salute him with a worthy salutation". (Quran 33:56)

</p><p align="justify"> The Blessed
Prophet is the noblest of creatures, the mercy of the universe, the purest of mankind, the
intercessor, the gracious Prophet Mohammad al-Mustafa (s) was the master of Messengers, the seal of the Prophets and the
most perfect of all Allah's creatures and the most beloved of Allah. He reached the pinnacle of glory
through his perfections, he illuminated the darkness of chaos by his splendor, all his habits were
elegant, blessings be upon him and his ahlul-bayt. He became not only the prophet and messenger of
Allah, but also the friend of Allah and a mercy sent unto the world for the Noble Quran states:
</p><p align="justify">"We sent thee not save as a mercy for the peoples". (Quran 21:107)

</p><p align="justify"> He is revered and loved by all
Muslims now as he was fourteen centuries ago. May the graces, blessings and peace of Allah be
upon Mohammad and his ahlul-bayt. 

</p><p></p><hr noshade="" width="85%">

<p align="justify"><b><font color="blue" size="5">Imam Ali said:</font></b>
</p><p align="justify">So that the grace of Allah, Glory be to Him, reach Mohammad (s), Allah brought him out of the best of sources and the most honourable places from which things grow, from the same lineal tree from which He brought forth His Prophets and selected their trustees. Mohammad's progeny is the best progeny, his family the best family and his lineal tree is the best of trees. It grew in sanctity, surpassing all in honour. Its branches are tall and its fruits cannot be reached.

</p><p align="justify">He is the leader of all those who fear Allah, and insight for those who seek guidance. He is a lamp whose flame is burning, a meteor whose light is shining and a flint whose spark is bright. His conduct is upright; his behaviour guidance; his speech is the criterion [between right and wrong] and his decision just.
Allah sent him, after an interval from the previous Prophets, when people had fallen into errors of action and ignorance....then the Prophet of Allah (s) exerted his utmost in giving sound advice, staying on the right path, calling them towards wisdom and good counsel..., his is the best abode and his origin the noblest of all, coming from the source of honour and the cradles of security. The hearts of the virtuous people incline towards him, and the eyes have focused on him. Through him, Allah buried all rancour and extinguished conflicts. Through him, He brought people together in brotherhood and separated friends. Through him, He elevated the lowly, and humiliated the arrogant and mighty.
His speech is  clear and even his silence is (indicative) like the tongue. He sent him with sufficient proof and satisfying admonitions. His call eliminates deficiencies, through him, the unknown laws were made manifest, the innovative practices subdued, and the distinctive judgements made clear. 

</p><p align="justify">He sent him with light and gave him precedence in purity. He mended all fissures. Through him, those conquering were [themselves] conquered, difficulties were subjugated and hardships alleviated until he wiped out misguidance all around him.
