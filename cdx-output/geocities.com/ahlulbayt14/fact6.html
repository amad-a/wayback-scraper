<p align="center"><b><font color="#008000" face="Arial" size="5">A Few Brief Facts About The Occupation of Golan</font></b></p>
<p></p><hr size="1" width="75%">
<p align="justify">* Israeli occupied Golan consists of 1,250 square kilometers of land.
</p><p align="justify">* In June 1967, during the "Six Day War," Israel occupies the Jordanian West Bank, Egyptian Gaza Strip and Sinai, and the Syrian Golan Heights.
</p><p align="justify">* After a 27 hour battle Israel had captured the Heights at the cost of 1,000 Syrian soldiers, and 115 Israeli deaths. Both Israel and Syria agreed to the UNs call for a cease fire on June 10, 1967.
</p><p align="justify">* In November of 1967, the U.N. Security Council passes Resolution 242 calling for Israel to pull out of occupied lands and for recognition of all states under the formula of ``land for peace.''
</p><p align="justify">* Rami Tal of the widely circulated Israeli newspaper<i> Yediyot Aharonot</i>, published a private conversation he had in 1976 with Israel's former chief of the General Staff and defense minister, Moshe Dayan. Dayan's account of the situation along the Syrian border from the time of Israel's establishment until the Six-day War of 1967 was nothing less than astounding:
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">After all, I know exactly how at least 80 percent of the incidents began. We would send a tractor to do some ploughing work in some spot in the demilitarized zone where farming activities were out of the question, and we knew in advance that the Syrians would start shooting. If they held their fire, we would instruct the tractor drivers to keep moving forward until the Syrians would lose their temper and start shooting. Then we would begin artillery shelling and, at a later stage, we would bring in the Air Force. This is what I did, and what Laskov and Tchera (chief of staff Zvi Tzur) also did, and what Yitzhak Rabin did as well. We thought then, and we continued to do so for a considerable while, that we could alter the armistice  lines through military operations that would be just short of actual war. In other words, by seizing some land and holding it until the enemy would despair   and let us keep it.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">* Before 1967 there were 249 Arab villages there.
</p><p align="justify">* When the Israelis occupied it they destroyed 244 of those villages, and only 5 villages remain.
</p><p align="justify">* 147,000 people were forced to leave as a result of the Israeli occupation.
</p><p align="justify">* The displaced Golanis and there families no number 500,000, and most of them still live together in Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps are set up around Syria.
</p><p align="justify">* The Israelis, now numbering about 18,000 in the Golan, have built 42 Jewish settlements in the area they occupied.
</p><p align="justify">* Ever Since Israel's occupation of the Golan, Zionists have spared no effort to integrate Golan history into Zionism. Immediately upon its occupation of the Golan, Israel started mass excavations on the Golan. But instead of finding Jewish remains, it unearthed abundant traces of cultures of Syrian Arab origin, from different ages.
</p><p align="justify">* For a couple of days during the Yom Kippur War in 1973 , the Golan Heights is recaptured by Syria. 
</p><p align="justify">* In 1975 Syria gets an area around the town of Quneitra, as a result of US-led talks after the Yom Kippur War. 
</p><p align="justify">* In 1981 Golan Heights is officially annexed by Menachim Begin's government, and on&nbsp; Dec 19, 1981 The UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 497 which reiterated that acquisition of territories by force is rejected as stipulated under the UN Charter, principles of International Law and its express Resolutions, and rendered null and void Israel's decision to annex the Golan into Israeli territory.
</p><p align="justify">* Once again on December 4, 1996, The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 51/28 which condemned Israel for not withdrawing " from the Syrian Golan, which has been under occupation since 1967, contrary to the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions." The resolution demanded&nbsp; once more that Israel withdraw from all the occupied Syrian Golan to the line of 4 June 1967 in implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions.
</p><p align="justify">* In June of 2000, Israeli officials gave the green light to a plan to construct 350 new homes in a Jewish settlement in the occupied Golan Heights, increasing the community's size by 10 times.
