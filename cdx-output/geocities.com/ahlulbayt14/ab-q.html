<center><p> The Word House (Ahlul-Bayt) in Quran</p></center>
<p></p><hr> House of Abraham (a)<hr>
<p align="justify">Quran testifies that Sarah, the wife of Prophet Abraham (a),

was blessed by angels and was given the glad tiding that she will

give birth to two prophets of God:

</p><p align="justify">[Quran 11:71]: And his wife, standing by, laughed when We gave her good

tidings (of the birth) of Isaac, and, after Isaac, of Jacob.

</p><p align="justify">[quran 11:72]: She said: "Alas for me! Shall I bear a child when I

am an old woman and my husband now is an old man? That would indeed

be a strange thing!"

</p><p align="justify">[Quran 11:73]: The (angles) said: Do You wonder at Allah's decree? The

grace of Allah and His blessings be upon you, O People of the

House! He is indeed worthy of all praise full of all glory!"

</p><p align="justify">Since in the mercy and the bounty of God offered in the above

verse to the People of the House of Abraham, it has been a tendency

of some Sunni commentators and their anxiety to find some argument

for their counting the wives of the Holy Prophet (s)

in the terms Ahlul-Bayt. They argue that since Sarah the wife

of Abraham is included in the term Ahlul-Bayt mentioned in the

above verse, then all the wives of the Prophet (s) are

included in the verse 33:33 relating to the purity and the excellence

of the Ahlul-Bayt of Prophet Muhammad.

</p><p align="justify">However, these commentators intentionally or otherwise ignore

the significance of the address by the Angels. If Sarah, the wife

of Abraham, is included in the term Ahlul-Bayt used in the above

verse, it is not because she was the wife of Abraham, but because

she was going to be the MOTHER of two prophets (Isaac and Jacob).

She was mentioned by angles in the above verse as a member of

Ahlul-Bayt, AFTER she RECEIVED the glad tiding that she is pregnant

of Prophet Isaac (a).
</p><p align="justify">The matrimonial relation between and a man and a woman is only

circumstantial and can be given up at any moment. She could never

be a permanent partner to any husband to be included in the heavenly

address who are endowed with the unique and heavenly excellence

UNLESS she brings a son who becomes a Prophet or an Imam. Thus

if we consider Sarah as a member of the House, it would be only

because she would be the mother of Isaac, and not being the wife

of Abraham. The verses 11:71-73 quoted above show that Sarah was

called among Ahlul-Bayt after she got to know that she is having

Isaac (a).</p><p></p><hr>
House of Imran (a)<hr>

<p align="justify">Likewise, Quran mentions the mother of Moses among the Ahlul-Bayt

of Imran. Again, as we can see in the following verses, the emphasis

here is the MOTHER of Moses and not the wife of Imran:

</p><p align="justify">[Quran 28:12]: And We ordained that he refuse to seek any foster mother

before so she said: Shall I point out to you a household

who will take care of him for you, and will be kind to him?

</p><p align="justify">[Quran 28:13]: So We restored him to his mother that she might be

comforted and not grieve, and that she might know that the promise

of Allah is true. But most of them know not.

</p><p align="justify">The mother of Moses is termed as Ahlul-Bayt, not for being the

wife of Imran, but for being the mother of Moses, otherwise the

wives who are subject to divorce and being substituted with women

better than them (Quran 66:5) can't be considered as Ahlul-Bayt

as pointed out by Zaid Ibn Arqam as well. This is illustrated

with the wife of Noah and Lot, though they were the wives of such

great servants of God, they were not considered Ahlul- Bayt. They

perished along with the rest of community.

</p><p align="justify">Let's remember what Zaid Ibn Arqam said: "Ahlul-Bayt (household)

of the Prophet are his lineage and his descendants (those who

come from his blood) for whom the acceptance of charity (Zakat)

is prohibited."

</p><p align="justify">The wife of Imran was in the lineage of the Moses, so was the

wife of Abraham who was in the lineage of Isaac and Jacob. Similarly,

if Fatimah is among the Ahlul-Bayt Prophet of Islam, it is

because not only she was the daughter of the Prophet (s),

but also she was the mother of two Imams.</p><p></p><hr>

House of Noah (a)<hr>

<p align="justify">And Noah Cried unto his Lord and said: "My Lord! Verily my

son is of my family; and verily Your promise is true, and You

are the most just of the judges."

</p><p align="justify">He (Allah) said: "O Noah! Verily he is not of your family;

Verily he is (of) conduct other than the righteous; Therefore

do not ask what you have no knowledge about; Verily I advice you

not to be of the ignorant ones." (Quran 11:45-46)

</p><p align="justify">Abul Ala Maududi wrote in his commentary of the above verse that:

"If a part of the body of a person becomes rotten and the

surgeon decides to cut it off, he will not comply with the request

of the patient, who says 'Do not cut because it is a part of my

body'. The surgeon will reply, 'It is no longer a part of your

body because it is rotten.' Likewise when a righteous father is

told that his son is a worthless act, it means to imply that the

efforts that you made to bring him up as a good son have gone

waste for the work is spoilt and ended in utter failure."

</p><p align="justify">Reference: Commentary of Quran by Abul Ala Maududi (published by the

Islamic Publications (Pvt) Limited), p367, under verse 11:45-46

</p><p align="justify">Prophet Noah (a) was pleading for his own son and the reply was

that the lad was not worthy of being his son. It is made crystal

clear by this verse that though one might be of the same blood

and flesh, born through the same parents, but if the issue doesn't

possess the good qualities of the parents then he or she is not

of his parents' stock (as said in the second verse). Noah had

three other sons, Aam, Sam and Yafas who were believers and who

with their wives entered the Ark and were saved and Kanan was

Noah's son by his OTHER wife who was a disbeliever and perished

along with her son.

</p><p align="justify">It can be concluded that if any one does not hold the goodness

of the correct faith in Allah, be he the son of the Apostle, he

is not to be of the stock of his parentage; His very birth through

his own parents is denied to him, even the right to be on God's

earth is withdrawn from him, and he is to be destroyed.

</p><p align="justify">Thus, even one is to be the son of a prophet of Allah, the lack

of righteousness gets him disowned from the progeny (Itrat) of

the apostolic family. It is for this reason that the term Ahlul-Bayt

is restricted to the deserving members of the House of the Prophet

and doesn't cover all of those who are born from his blood. Ahlul-Bayt

are only the individuals among Prophet's descendants who also

had close affinity in character and utmost spiritual attainment

with Prophet (s).
