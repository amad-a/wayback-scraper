<h2>I WENT HOME TO YAFA</h2>
<h2>SEE WHAT I FOUND</h2>
<b>
<p>
Old Yafa, I speak to you.  You are so beautiful.  Standing there I used to
smile and flirt with the women at their windows behind our house.
They laughed delighted.  Tamam lived in that house.  Not knowing her then,
maybe I waved to her.  Recently I climbed some steps behind my house and  
looked at the balcony where I played.  I saw strange things built on my
balcony.  The Israeli woman sitting there said that it was an entertainment
restaurant called the Israeli Experience.  I will tell you about my
home and my 'Israeli Experience'.

</blockquote>
<p>
On that balcony I played house and invited my sister.  Just outside the door
I drew out the floor plan with stones and markers like archeological remains.  
Some late days on that big balcony I collected bullet heads. I would wake 
my parents to show my handful.  Then in 1948 those Israeli bullets turned 
into bloody massacre.  They took our homes, our cities, and our country.  
They even took the furniture, the clothes, the paintings, and my books and 
toys.  Even our language they steel.  Their ancient language, impotent 
for modern times, they fill with our Arabic words.

<p>
Now in 1986 I can imagine what might have been.  I dream that for the past 
48 years we lived in our Palestine and brought it to the beautiful modern 
culture we own.  "The artists, musicians, and poets I know often come to my 
studio.  But today I am walking out back to visit Tamam in her studio.  
I approach through a narrow stone-paved street of old Yafa.  I take the 
beautiful flowers for granted.  It is the blue on blue of sea and sky 
and old city shutters that are on my mind."
</p><p>

<p>
They made our city into a playground.  Tamam's old home is now a tourist 
gallery.  I dream about what was stolen.  "Tamam's old family home is now 
her studio.  She has paintings all over.  Today Kamal came down from 
Jerusalem.  With familiar gestures we take our seats and sip Tamam's coffee.  
We talk about her paintings on all the walls".  In reality as I stood in 
that very room I measure the depth of our loss.  I looked at the man tending 
his pictures but I could not bridge the gulf between us.  In my minds eye 
I could still see Tamam's wonderful painting of her home in Yafa titled:  
"Shoshona Occupies My Studio".  The man in the room told me Shoshona 
lives upstairs and that he now has the gallery.  So today Shoshona occupies 
Tamam's bedrooms.

<p>
These are the old steps and the old bakery where Tamam played.  We saw them, 
my sister and I, walking through Yafa.  Then we ran into some American 
tourists.  The Israeli guide was telling them how the architecture is 
influenced by this or that rabbinical idea.  Such brazen lies.  My sister 
lost her silence.  She quietly told them that this is Arab architecture 
in this occupied and stolen city of Yafa.  The guide looked shamed.  
Anguished, my sister shook so much that she could not continue.  She 
feared she would pass out.  I took up where she left off.  The tourists 
were stunned.  Some laughed nervously.  I remember how shaken by anger my 
father would be.  He grieves over Yafa.  They are so obscene in their 
lordship that they name taxicab companies after it.  In New York there 
are at least two night spots with Yafa for a name.   
</p><p>
Then I went to the heart of what was modern Yafa in 1948.  I took a picture
of the clock-tower square.  I tried to find my father's shop.  I looked 
at the old buildings in such disrepair.  The roofs are caved in.  Arabs 
are not allowed to fix their buildings or their homes without a permit 
from the Israelis.  Of course the Israelis do not give permits.  They 
enforce this law until Arab homes are unfit to live in.  Then they take 
them.  They also bring tourists and tell them to look at how dirty the 
Arabs are.  It is their dirt and all history will remember this their dirt.
</p><p>
We visited Hasan Bek Mosque.  It was Friday and after prayer we went in to 
talk with the caretakers.  They told us that volunteer men came from 
AlKhalil (what they call Hebron) and fixed the ceiling.  It had been 
allowed to cave in.  The Israelis put these men in jail because they 
fixed the ceiling of their mosque - their place of worship.  Later the  
congregation asked for a permit to fix the compound wall which is in 
severe disrepair.  The Israelis will not give it and they have 
destroyed all the Arab homes surrounding the mosque.  These men told us
that in 1948 there were 120 thousand Palestinians Arabs in Yafa.  In 1949
there were only three thousand and now they number 17 thousand.  
</p><p>
My school mate was one of those three thousand who stayed.  The Israelis 
shot and shot at their home but they refused to leave.  They then took her 
fathers business.  But they holed up at home and were very very stubborn.  
Others who stayed and had their homes shot at continuously did lose 
family members to Israeli bullets.
</p><p>
I swam in our Mediterranean sea.  I made a painting about it once because
my favorite dream was of the sea talking to me.  I found shards of old 
tiles.  I looked up to find their source and saw a cemetery on a hill of sand. 
It was sliced by bulldozers.  In the fresh slice I saw cross-sections of 
graves six feet below the surface.  The Arab fisherman said that 
it was an old Arab cemetery called the Kofaliye and then he added accusingly
that its owners all left and abandoned it.  Poor old fisherman unable 
to punish the guilty, he, like the Israelis, instead attacks the victims.
