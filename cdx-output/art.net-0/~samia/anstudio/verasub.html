<h2>Transience Set in Clay</h2>
<h3>A meeting with Ramallah artist Vera Tamari</h3>
<h4>by Rana Anani</h4>
<p>
I met Vera Tamari in her modest studio in Ramallah and began
by asking her whether she had a specific idea in her mind
before she started working or whether she allowed the clay
spontaneously to mold her creativity. 
</p><p>
"Before I start working, " she said, "I always have a
subject that's been crystallizing in my mind for a long
time. It will have come from certain impressions I have had
in my daily life. I let it float in my mind until the idea
settles. Occasionally I'll draw preparatory sketches for the
work I'm going to do, so that I will have a clear idea of
where I'm going. But I usually choose a subject that needs
to be treated from various angles, in other words, something
that I can tackle through a series of works. 
</p><p>
"Recently, two subjects have particularly interested me. The
first are paintings inspired by the natural landscape in
Palestine, hills, trees and grass. I usually concentrate on
texture and liveliness, and try to reflect these in my work.
The second subject I'm interested in now is family
portraits. I've been looking for old photographs of my
family from the twenties and thirties, when they lived in
Jaffa. I try to create works that reflect the spirit of that
period, but through my own eyes. 
</p><p>
"I don't look at these old photographs in a conventional
way. I try to see something tin the spirit and atmosphere of
the picture that will reflect the true warmth that existed
between the members of the family. Families used to sit all
poker-faced in front of that modern contraption, the camera.
I can't help thinking how there are intimate ties between
the people, yet one-dimensional expressions presented to the
camera. So I don't draw the sitters' faces - it's not
relevant to know whether this is my father, brother, uncle,
or even me. 
</p><p>
"The idea came to my mind as a result of the feeling that we
lack the family atmosphere these days, and the large
extended families we had have been scattered throughout the
world. My mother has often talked to me about how close-knot
was our family in the past. But we don't seem to have that
closeness nowadays. Sometimes they would all meeting
together in family gatherings, and I've tried to record
those moments. In a sense I felt I was putting myself in
touch with that past family existence. So far, I've done
eight or nine works on this subject. 
</p><p>
"Usually I make the people in the colors of the natural
clay, but I'll color the background. This seems to give a
suitable atmosphere. 
</p><p>
"So as to include elements other than just wood and clay,
sometimes I make the frame part of the painting. I might do
this more and more in the future. In one of my recent works,
I used wood and other natural materials, like twigs and
grass. I add these to the work once it has been
substantially completed. In other works representing scenes
from nature I use old broken pieces of clay that I've
collected. 
</p><p>
"As to the way I prepare clay, I insert a large piece of
clay into the wooden frame and work it until it fills the
whole area. This is a tiring process that needs a lot of
hard work and kneading. the clay must be even and moist.
It's like bread dough, but heavier and harder. Then I start
making the figures. Gradually, the idea starts to emerge.
Then I begin to add decoration and detail. 
</p><p>
"Throughout this stage, I maintain the dampness of the clay,
and cover it so that it will not be exposed to sun or
draughts. Usually the paint takes a week to dry. So it's a
slow and difficult process. Sometimes, I envy painters
because their work doesn't demand the time that mine does. 
</p><p>
"After the piece is completely dry I remove it from the
frame and fire it. I always try to fire several pieces in
the oven at the same time, to make full use of the heat of
the oven. The pieces need to be fired for several hours, and
a day to cool. only then can I begin to paint them. 
</p><p>
"The subjects I tackle in my clay plaques, particularly
propel, have an intimate nature, so it would not work to
make then large; they would lose their meaning. I usually
take the idea from a photograph, enlarging it slightly. But
if it becomes too large it loses its meaning. Besides, large
clay items have a tendency to fracture during firing. My
studio is small too. But having said all that, I do wish
that I could work on larger pieces. 
</p><p>
"I've never tried, for example, to make public statues. My
largest works are clay jars. They are closer to the idea of
sculpture. I have also done some murals, one in the Notre
Dame Center in Jerusalem. I've also been commissioned to
create small wall decorations in some houses, and have
continued to use clay for that. I think it's effective
mounting these pieces on a utilitarian background. One thing
complimenting the other. When I have enough time I'll
continue with that. 
</p><p>
"The clay I use is, of course, imported. I have to fetch it
from Tel Aviv. It comes either from America or Holland. I
prefer it to local clay because it doesn't need sifting or
purifying. It also has the ability to withstand high oven
temperatures without fracturing. It has a good deep ochre
color, whereas local clay is very pale, almost white. I
prefer darker colors. 
</p><p>
"Imported clay is machine processed, so it always has a
consistent quality, but local clay need a lot of extra
preparation and attention. 
</p><p>
"In a sense the pottery industry here is in its infancy - if
we're not speaking of the traditional village pottery which
has its own heritage, made by women who instinctively know
how to make balanced and harmonious jars. They also know how
to decorate and apply natural colors. This tradition was
very beautiful, but unfortunately it's dying out. But a
pottery department has been opened in Al-Tireh College, so
that young women will now be trained in this. 
</p><p>
Vera Tamari comes from an artistic family. Her brother
Vladimir is a creative artist, and her sister Tania Nasser
is a singer. They were all brought up in a climate of
interest in music, literature and visual art. Vera studies
fine arts at Beirut Girls College, before going on to study
ceramics in Florence, supplemented by courses in Britain and
Japan. 
</p><p>
She took a masters degree in the History of Art and Islamic
Architecture at Oxford, and now teaches those subjects at
Birzeit University. She has exhibited in Baghdad ('Arab
Women Artists, 1980) and in Jerusalem in 1986 contributed to
the first Palestinian feminist exhibition. She also
contributed to the British Museum publication, The
Palestinian House.
