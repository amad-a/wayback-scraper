<h2>ARTIST OF PALESTINE</h2>
<h1>Sari Khouri</h1>
<p>
Born in Jerusalem, Palestine, 1941.  Graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Ohio 
Wesleyan University and late he earned a Master of Fine Arts from Cranbrook Academy of art.
In 1997 Sari Khoury began teaching drawing and Painting at Central Michigan University and
continued to do so till his death in 1996.
</p><p>
Khoury kas exhibited in several solo, group, and invitational shows.  His work has been 
shown in Detroit, New York, Washington, San Francisco, Seattle, Tokyo, and Germany.
</p><p>
His formal statement about his work:
</p><p>
"My work has developed over the years from a figurative to a non-figurative approach.  
However, certain elements of the figure continue to persist.  
Symbolic content is more suggested 
than contrived, and emerges out of a personal warehouse of experiences.  My visual
vocabulary is rooted in my training in the modern traditions ranging from Cubism, to
Surrealism, to Abstract Expressionism.  Influences on my work incorporate the enigmatic
paintings of Klee and Gorky, the structural sense of Kandinsky and the spontaneity of Matisse.
Hence, my work can be hard edge on one hand, and expressionistic on the other.  But in either
case the emphasis remains on the spontaneity of shape, line, texture, and color.
</p><p>
My cultural roots encompass both Arabic writing, Islamic design, as well as Byzantine 
images, such as icons of the Orthodox church.  the Byzantine influence manifests itself mainly through the 
suspension of images, the sense of design, and a nonobjective approach to the human
figure.  Elements of the Arabic scripts, Naskhi and Kufic (script and block letters), 
is manifested in my work 
in the balance of curvilinear configurations and geometricity."
