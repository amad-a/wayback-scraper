<h1>On The Leading Edge</h1>
<h3>Themes in Kinetic Computer Painting</h3>
<b>
<blockquote>
<a href="isis.gif"><img src="http://art.net/~samia/kinetic/group/themes.html/isis_tn.gif"></a>
</blockquote>
<h3>"Isis"</h3> emerges from observation of the grouping of plants.  Plants grow most 
often in groups as a result of the interaction of seeds with the wind, soil, 
rocks, and rain, etc.  Thus it started with a small square as a seed then 
certain algorithms were applied to it to distribute it. 
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<a href="bras2.gif"><img src="http://art.net/~samia/kinetic/group/themes.html/bras2_tn.gif"></a>
<a href="brass.gif"><img src="http://art.net/~samia/kinetic/group/themes.html/brass_tn.gif"></a>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><h3>"Brass Women"</h3> was inspired by discussion of the members of the group about 
their strong admiration of the power of some Black and Latino women.  It is 
therefore a homage to Latino and Black American women who speak loudly in 
defense of liberation and equality.
<blockquote>
<a href="city.gif"><img src="http://art.net/~samia/kinetic/group/themes.html/city_tn.gif"></a>
<a href="city2.gif"><img src="http://art.net/~samia/kinetic/group/themes.html/city2_tn.gif"></a>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><h3>"City"</h3> is based on the passing of a day in a large city like New York.  It 
begins before dawn when people are preparing to take the train to work.  It 
dwells for a time on the great pleasure of taking a break.  This part was 
inspired by the joyful congregation of office workers with their lunches in 
down-town parks.  The piece ends with evening rush hour and transportation 
out of the city.
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<a href="bran.gif"><img src="http://art.net/~samia/kinetic/group/themes.html/bran_tn.gif"></a>
<a href="bran2.gif"><img src="http://art.net/~samia/kinetic/group/themes.html/bran2_tn.gif"></a>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><h3>"Branching"</h3> is inspired by the movement of aggregations of small things.  
How tree leaves are organized and how they respond to the wind is one example 
of the source of this piece.  Another is the movement of crowds of people 
in a large train station.
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<a href="rhyth.gif"><img src="http://art.net/~samia/kinetic/group/themes.html/rhyth_tn.gif"></a>
<a href="ryth2.gif"><img src="http://art.net/~samia/kinetic/group/themes.html/ryth2_tn.gif"></a>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><h3>"Rhythms"</h3> has its basis in various levels of rhythms evoked by our human 
body.  That varies from the rhythm of walking, heart beating, talking, 
running, sleeping, and others.  It is a piece where musicians and painting 
all move at a vigorous level.
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<a href="yafa.gif"><img src="http://art.net/~samia/kinetic/group/themes.html/yafa_tn.gif"></a>
<a href="yafa2.gif"><img src="http://art.net/~samia/kinetic/group/themes.html/yafa2_tn.gif"></a>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><h3>"Yafa"</h3> is the city of my childhood. It is always with me and in all my art.  My visual
memory is brimful of its sweetness.  I remember the beautiful women with the 
colorfully transparent scarves, elegantly splashed over their faces as veils, 
juxtaposed with gardens and flowers and strolls with my sister in a baby carriage. 
In our Palestine of the late thirties there was a sense of futurism and 
optimism.  This has been forgotten under the brutality of Israeli occupation.  This 
work combines my love and my anger to relay the incredible beauty of Yafa which 
I know for certain will live yet again.
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<a href="rain.gif"><img src="http://art.net/~samia/kinetic/group/themes.html/rain_tn.gif"></a>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><h3>"Rain"</h3> has its basis also in things that move as a whole group.  Not 
only rain but also snow and dust and flying leaves as well as pebbles in 
water all have had a part in influencing this work.
