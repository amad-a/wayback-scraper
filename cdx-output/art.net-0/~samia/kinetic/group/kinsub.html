<h1>Kinetic Computer Paintings</h1>
<h4>An early essay written by the director of the Group, Samia A. Halaby</h4>
<b>

<p>
I began to write programs which create kinetic abstractions during 1984.  Kinetic, because they are programs which run for several minutes creating an imagery of abstraction in motion.  I began to program because I was dissatisfied with drawing and painting software.  The computer's potential as a medium for painting is much more exciting than off-the-shelf software.
</p><p>

</p><p>
 I had never studied computer science or programming but began to teach myself immediately.  It was not painful.  I was deeply absorbed.  I began 
with logo on an apple and felt amazement at the development of an abstract 
image right before my eyes.  I kept repeating it.  I moved on to basic on the
Amiga in 1986 and could not peel myself away from the pleasures of creating images
which not only moved but made sound.  I also programmed the sounds.  Some of my friends loved the images but hated the sounds.  Some friends thought
that I had relinquished artistic judgment to a machine.
</p><p>

<a href="rhy2_k11.gif"><img src="http://art.net/~samia/kinetic/group/kinsub.html/rhy2_tn.gif"></a>
</p><p>
In time I learnt to program in C.  It was not hard.  It was merely the
insanity of fascination.  I had clear ideas about abstract form in
painting and intuitively recognized the potential for expanding this new
twentieth century visual language through the computer.  I am definitely not
interested in three dimensional illusion.  I am often told that I might
expand my language by using <i>'more advanced technology'</i>.  These critics
tell me that I should scan some three dimensional images and add them to
my abstractions.  
</p><p>
<a href="kin2.gif"><img src="http://art.net/~samia/kinetic/group/kinsub.html/kin2_tn.gif"></a> 
<a href="kin10.gif"><img src="http://art.net/~samia/kinetic/group/kinsub.html/kin10_tn.gif"></a>
</p><p>
I am too polite to tell them that they do not have the mind and the eye to
see that that is not more advanced but rather more backward.  I seek to
expand a radical new language in art.  I do not feel impressed by three dimensional software or by scanning photographs.  I can draw well enough and render in traditional academic ways.  That is fine.  But in painting as in science we are nothing if we do not push forward the boundaries of our knowledge.
</p><p>
I have made a careful evaluation of the history of pictures to assure myself
that I make no errors of judgment.  Examining history has always been an integral part of my artistic work from the very 
beginning. I think ray tracing is an extremely useful and appropriate 
extension of Renaissance perspective.  It has aided the production of those
materials we need for living.  But for painting as a vanguard activity
ray tracing is old hat.  There are newer formal ideas.  It is not the 
computer's ability to imitate optics that I find fascinating.
</p><p>
Beside an intellectual persuasion I feel a genuine and palpable 
disappointment when a three dimensional image breaks down the illusion 
created by an abstract space which in reality is a four dimensional illusion.
</p><p>
I want to develop visual ideas on speed differentials.  I look at the world 
around me and I see that things move at different speeds visually in relation 
to each other and to me.  I wish to extract general principles of motion 
based on these observation and apply them to my paintings.  The computer, as a 
digital media, has allowed me to deepen visual ideas of form and illusion not 
easily possible otherwise.
</p><p>
So these paintings which I call KINETIC COMPUTER PAINTINGS are in fact 
programs which run on a computer and create sounds.  The sound is
an important new idea as an adjunct to abstract form.  As things move they
also make sound.
</p><p>
Recently, while watching musicians jam at a SCAN (Small Computers in the
Arts Network) conference, I decided 
that I will write a program which will enable me to perform a painting live
in collaboration with musicians.  I did so and have been performing paintings 
along with musicians.  We jam sound and abstract image.

Two of the published papers which I have written on the subject of kinetic 
paintings are available to read here.  <a href="http://art.net/~samia/kinetic/essays/fisea96.html"><i><b>RHYTHMS, 
The Aesthetics of Electronic Painting</b></i></a> was written for the <i>Seventh 
International Symposium on Electronic Art</i> held in Rotterdam The Netherlands, 
September 16-20, 1996.  And, <a href="http://art.net/~samia/kinetic/essays/fisea93.html"><i><b>TECHNOLOGY, 
ABSTRACTION AND KINETIC PAINTING</b></i></a> was written for the <i>Fourth 
International Symposium on Electronic Art</i> held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 
U.S.A. November 3-7, 1993.
