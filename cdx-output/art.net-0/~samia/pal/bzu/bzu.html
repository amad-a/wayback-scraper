<p>
       During the spring of 1996, I spent several weeks collaborating with
Professor Vera Tamari in teaching art at BirZeit University.  Our project provided 
all of us with a level of aesthetic satisfaction permeated by love of our land.

	On the first day I told the students about my life and asked them to tell about 
theirs.  One student told about his internment and torture in an Israeli prison.  At the end 
of my stay with them I had occasion to visit another student in a PNA prison taking him some 
paper mache so that he might make-up his class-work.

<p>
Two weeks before my arrival, there had been a surprise Israeli raid on these university 
students during the middle of the night.  They were pulled out of their beds, then made 
to stand for over four hours in the cold night air wearing only their bed clothes.  Those 
from Gaza were kidnapped and sent back to Gaza without legal permission to return.  This would 
be called a pogrom if done in Europe against Jews.  It would be shocking if done in the US 
or in Europe; but here the Israeli Jews call it a 'security check' and the mass media seems 
to implicitly approve through its silence.

<p>
	Because the Palestinian Arab society and land are under so much attack by Israel, 
it was important to use materials that did not pose a burden.  We settled happily on paper 
mache.  We called it majoun al-warak -- kneaded paper.  And we kneaded and kneaded.  The 
students worked in social groups and converted the work into fun.

<p>
	Before my arrival the students collected paper waste from all the university 
departments.  Thus the project had an environmentally useful dimension.  Vera and I 
discussed the project as we commuted to the university in the shared taxi called the 'service' 
used by students and faculty alike.  One morning, squeezed between students and admiring the 
sight of our mountains adorned with rows of rocks, we arrived at a final definition of our 
project.  I love the way peasants clear these stones by hand using them to terrace and divide 
mountain sides; and I love how they plant olive trees.  It is a sight to elicits pleasurable 
nostalgia and simultaneously all the pain of seeing it being destroyed -- a very symbol of 
Palestine.

	I looked forward to that ride each morning and each evening.  My hungry eyes 
opened to its beauty and my mind raced to memorize those principles which underlay such 
beauty.  I knew that the distribution of those rock and those trees will make themselves 
visible in my paintings.  And further lessons came when I saw them manifested in the visual 
expressions of our students.

	We asked the students to look at the reality surrounding them, natural or social, 
then discern general principles which govern such a reality.  We asked
them to then apply these principles to abstract bas-relief sculptures made with paper mache.  
It was an extremely advanced and difficult project.  When they complained or when they stumbled 
we threw them into the joys of kneading the squooshy paper pulp.  We made them get into the 
work and rebuild it repeatedly until practice and discourse helped them find answers.

<p>
	On afternoon as they struggled to feel out the possibilities of paper mache we 
suggested they use rocks as a base on which to mold this difficult material.  A few hours 
later four of them struggled into the classroom with a enough stones for everyone.  And 
they looked at me and said:  "Miss, these are the stones of our land."  They are so beautiful.

	Each student participated in one joint project but was also responsible for three 
individual works.  Some of the group projects dealt with the
development of the Intifadah and the oppression which caused it.  Some dealt
with the relationship of Mediterranean sea and Palestinian land.  Some dealt
the seasons of the year; while some dealt with the rocks and trees
surrounding the town of BirZeit.

<p>
	These students all get the highest grades in my professor's book.  Their visual 
acumen is as substantial as their character.  I was and still am impressed with their 
accomplishment and that of their teacher Vera Tamari.  I look at this work and see its innate 
value.  I take note that its genuine substance looks good even when compared to work that 
I have seen in the world's most sophisticated museums of modern art.

	Those three weeks with them were joyful days of teaching.  They are brilliant in 
memory.  They brought a small measure of healing to the forced exile from Palestine.  Other 
teaching days which matched them were those of teaching Asian and Pacific students at the 
University of Hawaii during one particular semester in 1985.  Like my Hawaiian students, our 
Palestinian students felt
that an appropriate ending to our collaboration must be an outing.  
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<img align="top" src="http://www.art.net/~samia/pal/bzu/bzu.html/bz10_tn.gif">
</blockquote>
<p>
	For this outing we were invited by one student to his home village of Jifna and the 
day was exquisite.  We entered into the fabric of family relations in this one of the few 
remaining Palestinian villages.  We were met by elders and told of how after the occupation 
the Israeli settlers arrived one day with a detachment of soldiers and openly stole the ancient 
stone carvings from within the old fortification.  This fortification is in essence a tiny 
medieval town from which the village had grown.  Our hosts also walked us through some of 
the ancient ruins which the villagers proudly protect while waiting for proper excavation.  
Later out in the surrounding fields as we strolled beneath olive trees and jumped over rock 
walls the students sang an old peasant song of Palestine and I felt angry regrett for all that 
might have been in Palestine and for all the pain that has been in Palestine.
</p><p>

</blockquote>
<p>
	At the end we sat in a stepped field on the broken soil or on stones under the 
protection of a huge tree.  The students sang and played games with a youthful innocence 
starkly contrasting the harshness of Israeli occupation on their lives.  Our hosts served 
us drinks and sliced melon on a silver tray.  I felt honored.
