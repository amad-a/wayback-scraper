<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">&nbsp;</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">With visual demonstrations and clear explanations,
documentary films can have a powerful effect in raising community awareness
and in providing training services. Although video production is not new
in Gaza, for many years none of the existing units produced documentaries
or professional quality films from start to finish. Recognizing the need
for such a unit, the GCMHP established the Gaza Video Center in late 1995.
During 1996 and 1997, the Center’s video team received training and support
and produced documentary films about psycho-social problems in Gaza.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">&nbsp;</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">While some of the Center’s crew had previous
experience with local producers in Gaza, none had the expert training necessary
to produce high-quality documentaries about mental health issues. From
the C’s establishment, the team has received professional training from
both local and international experts. In April 1996, two specialists from
the Video Center’s Danish partner, “Final Cut Productions,” conducted a
one-month training course for the staff on how to make documentaries. International
guests of the GCMHP with knowledge of video production have also provided
training for the team. Currently, the Center is preparing to conduct for
its staff an advanced training course in video production. In addition,
for the first time, the Video Center, in conjunction with the Women’s Empowerment
Project, has begun training women in video and production. In the future,
the Center hopes to offer more training for community members.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">During the last two years, the Gaza Video
Center has produced ten documentary films on Palestinian society. As the
victims of many social problems in Gaza, children have been the focus of
the majority of the Center’s films. <i>Near to Death</i>, concentrates
on children living near Israeli settlements. <i>Little Hands</i> discusses
the rising phenomena of child labor in Gaza. Other films address the physical
and psychological effects of violence on children, specifically as a result
of the <i>intifada.</i> Another major area of focus over the last two years
has been the issue of women’s rights. <b>Women Rights are Human Rights</b>
tells the story of victims of domestic violence and explains the different
aspects of violence against women in the Palestinian society. The Center
also produces films that address the problems of water pollution, fishermen,
youth, drug abuse, mental health, and mental illness.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The Video Center’s films have been shown in
workshops and conferences and used in training throughout Palestine. In
July 1997, the video team received an award for <i>Near to Death</i> at
the Cairo Third International Festival for Television and Radio. Palestinian
Television aired <i>Little Hands</i>, as did a television station in Italy.
Currently negotiations are taking place to air more of the Center’s films
on Palestinian Television.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The Video Center has filmed conferences, workshops,
ceremonies, demonstrations, and interviews. The team is working with two
independent filmmakers on documentaries concerning the problems faced by
youth and by returnees in adapting to life in Gaza. Further, the Center
has been documenting oral histories of refugees uprooted from their homes
in 1948.</font></div>


<p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">Over the next three years, the Video Center
will produce two series of films dealing with mental health and mental
illness. One series will consist of seventeen short (10-15 minute) films
to be used by the different departments and projects of the GCMHP for training
of both GCMHP staff and health professionals receiving advanced training
in mental health. The second series of films is intended for public consumption
in order to raise community awareness about mental health issues, overcome
the stigma attached to mental illness, and assist people who are coping
with psychological disorders – their own or those of friends and family.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The Gaza Video Center has played an important
role in the work of the GCMHP during the last two years. With an aggressive
strategy and an enthusiastic, dedicated staff, it will continue to provide
Gaza with even more documentaries in order to disseminate necessary information
about mental health issues and psycho-social problems in Palestinian society.</font>

Hands</font></font></font></b></center>


<p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">Tragically, child abuse is far from rare. Children
are beaten, cut, burned, and scarred through physical aggression and maltreatment.
They also face sexual and emotional abuse. While these forms of child abuse
are common and recognized all over the world, certain forms of abuse go
unnoticed. One such form is the tragic phenomena of child labor, recently
on the rise here in Gaza.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">More than 50% of the population in Gaza are
children younger than 15 years of age. Sharing the abject conditions of
life in Gaza with the rest of society, children also have particular hardships
of their own. For the seven years of the <i>intifada</i> children were
deprived of proper health and education services – basic needs of children
everywhere. In addition, they faced the full force of Israeli military
violence, which meant beatings, arrests, tear gas, house raids, live ammunition.
This long-term traumatic treatment led to severe psychosocial disturbances.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">Before the <i>intifada,</i> Palestinian children
used to hear endless stories from their parents about their experiences
of defeat. They saw keys to the homes from which their grandparents were
uprooted. Hating the feelings of powerlessness and helplessness all around
them, they refused to depend on their parents and decided to take the initiative
and act on their own to recover their lost dignity. They wanted to prove
that they could succeed where their parents and grandparents had failed.
Now the <i>intifada</i> is over but the energy remains, and children feel
that they must work because again the adults are unable to afford for the
lives of their children and families.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">During the <i>intifada,</i> the highest social
value was accorded to resisting the Israeli occupation. As children played
a central role in this resistance, they identified themselves with the
image of power and were recognized as heroes. Not to lose that heroic identity
and to maintain their psychological well being, children have adapted to
the social value that has come to play an increasingly important role since
1993: material value. In Gaza today, the most important thing is to find
a job and make money in order to survive. Money means power and children
don’t want to lose the power which enabled them to achieve their self-actualization.
Thus, they enter the labor market in search of social power.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">Of course, these psychological determinants
have to be understood within the socioeconomic context of the post-Oslo
period. With the closure of the Gaza Strip in March 1993, and the economic
siege beginning in February 1996, tens of thousands of Palestinian laborers
were deprived of access to their work in Israel. As a result, unemployment
rates in Gaza skyrocketed, reaching their peak at 70% of the Palestinian
labor force. Accordingly, many Palestinian families began pushing their
children to work in order to achieve a small income for the family. A study
of child labor carried out by UNICEF examined 300 Palestinian children
and showed that 52% of the children were forced into work by their families
and that 44% of them began work only after Israel imposed the economic
siege. The relationship between child labor and the socioeconomic conditions
in Gaza is very clear.</font>
