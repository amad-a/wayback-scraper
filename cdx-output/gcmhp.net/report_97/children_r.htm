<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">&nbsp;</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">Children remain one of the most vulnerable
segments of the Palestinian population. The <i>intifada</i>, the struggle
which brought Palestinian children worldwide recognition, also brought
them immense suffering as the Israeli war machine attempted to brutally
crush the uprising. Children were beaten, shot, arrested, and exposed to
tear gas; they had their bones broken, their houses raided, their friends
and families humiliated. The tremendous, lasting psychological damage that
the Israeli soldiers inflicted upon Palestinian children has left them
to cope with anxiety, depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),
hyperactivity, bedwetting, sleep walking, night-terror and nightmares.
As the Israeli imposed closure and continued intransigence suppresses Gaza’s
attempts to crawl forward in the post-Oslo era, Palestinian children face
new anxieties and stresses associated with harsh economic conditions and
the despair resulting from unrealized dreams of peace.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">Providing mental health care for the children
of Gaza has always been a major concern of the GCMHP. In 1991, the GCMHP
began working with children and teachers in kindergartens. In 1993, the
Children’s Committee was formed to develop and advance the approach of
the GCMHP towards improving the mental health status of children in the
area. Through the integration of preventive and therapeutic work, the Children’s
Committee continues its vital activity.</font></div>

<br>&nbsp;
<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The Children’s Committee provided treatment
to 502 new clients in 1997, with 65% referred by the family and 19% by
community workers, and the other 16% by doctors, kindergartens, schools,
and NGOs. The Children’s Committee staff, consisting of one psychiatrist,
one general practitioner, six psychologists, two social workers, and one
nurse, provide therapy to children through counseling, supportive therapy,
play therapy, family therapy, individual dynamic and cognitive behavior
psychotherapy. Nearly one-half of the treatment sessions during 1997 consisted
of family based counseling.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">In order to initiate contact with increasing
numbers of children, the Committee works within the settings that structure
most children’s activities: schools, summer camps, clubs, and kindergartens.</font></div>

<ul>
<li>
<font size="+0">The Committee worked with 120 children at three summer camps
in 1997, conducting sessions devoted to: <i>true story-telling</i>, in
which children are asked to relate important events in their lives and
to respond to the stories of others;<i> role-playing</i>, in which groups
of children create roles for themselves and act them out; and <i>free drawing</i>,
in which they are free to draw whatever they want. At the same time, children
are asked to tell about their dreams.</font></li>

<li>
<font size="+0">The Committee visited 9 schools informally in 1996, working
in close cooperation with teachers. In those visits, the staff met teachers,
arranged for formal meetings, and conducted assessment and follow-up on
cases of children referred to the GCMHP by the schools. In 1997, the staff
conducted 43 visits to 13 schools, counseling teachers and assessing potential
child cases. Finally, in 1997 the GCMHP received formal permission to visit
12 UNRWA schools. At these schools, the staff meets with teachers and conducts
story-telling, role-playing, and free drawing sessions with groups of 35
children.</font></li>

<li>
<font size="+0">In February 1997, the UNRWA director asked the Children’s
Committee to intervene in a crisis after a 12-year old student was beaten
to death by her father. A team of two psychologists and two social workers
conducted a debriefing process and treated the students’ post traumatic
stress reactions.</font></li>

<li>
<font size="+0">During the first six months of 1997, the Children’s Committee
visited 28 kindergartens, working with children, parents, and teachers
to promote awareness of mental health issues. In kindergartens, both teachers
and parents can be approached outside of the clinical setting, thus minimizing
the stigma of psychiatric consultation. The staff interacts with children,
educates teachers about how to deal with psychological problems, and conducts
meetings (13 in the first half of 1997) with the children’s mothers, all
of which allows for more questions about behavioral and psychological problems.</font></li>
</ul>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">&nbsp;</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">Over the last two years, the Children’s Committee
has increased its outreach work intended to raise public awareness about
mental health issues and to widen its network of referrals.</font></div>

<ul>
<li>
<font size="+0">In 1997, the staff gave thirty lectures at public meetings
on subjects such as bed wetting, child aggression, anxiety, phobia, trauma
and children, children’s rights, play therapy, communicating with children,
lying, normal and abnormal development, the effects of violence on children,
children’s behavior problems, risk factors of conduct disorder in children,
and the mental health of families.</font></li>

<li>
<font size="+0">The Children’s Committee made 42 visits in 1997 to other
institutions working with children, such as The Child Development Center,
El-Shorque Club, World Refugee Children, Canaan Institution, El-Wafa Rehabilitation
Center, El-Helal Center, Save the Children, and the Child Educational Center.
They provided workshops and coordinated activities, including case referrals
and training.</font></li>

<li>
<font size="+0">The staff conducted two workshops for teachers on 15-16 March
1997 and 3-4 November 1997. The staff presented subjects such as the concept
of communication, communication blocks, family communication, physical
development, social development, and emotional development to the 35 teachers
who participated.</font></li>
</ul>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">&nbsp;Finally, the Children’s Committee took
part in the training offered by the Training Department of the GCMHP. Children’s
Committee members participated in training activities such as courses,
study days, workshops, seminars, and case conferences.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">During 1998, the Children’s Committee intends
to expand, adopting programs to train young adults about child development
and to provide them with communications skills, sexual education, and other
knowledge to promote effective parenting.</font></div>


<p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">Children remain one of the most targeted groups
in Palestinian society. Exposed to violence in the home and in the streets,
forced to labor under difficult conditions, and surrounded by economic
deprivation, Palestinian children face immense difficulties and severe
trauma. The Children’s Committee at the GCMHP addresses that trauma, offering
therapy and counseling to children, teachers, and child-care providers
in order to help children overcome the many obstacles to their development
so they can live a strong, healthy life.</font>

<center><b><font color="#000066">CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS EXHIBITED IN JAPAN</font></b></center>


<p>Among the most important therapeutic techniques used by the Children’s
Committee is&nbsp;
<br>“Free Drawing.”&nbsp; At summer camps, kindergartens, and schools,
the Committee gives&nbsp;
<br>children the opportunity to express their hopes, dreams, and fears
through drawing.&nbsp;
<br>This provides an important outlet for children to release their emotions
and communicate&nbsp;
<br>their traumas.&nbsp; It also provides a means for the Children’s Committee
staff to assess the&nbsp;
<br>mental health needs of children, both on an individual and a community
level.&nbsp;

</p><p>Some of these drawings are now being exhibited throughout Japan in an
effort to raise&nbsp;
<br>awareness of the situation of Palestinian children.&nbsp; Peace on
Earth, a Japanese NGO,&nbsp;
<br>has included ten drawings from the GCMHP collection, along with thirteen
other&nbsp;
<br>drawings from Palestine, fifteen photos, a map, and Palestinian embroidery
in the&nbsp;
<br>“Art Exhibition of Traumatic Children in Palestine.”&nbsp; A six-day
exhibition during&nbsp;
<br>December 1997 attracted over 800 visitors.&nbsp; Throughout 1998, Peace
on Earth&nbsp;
<br>will continue to hold the exhibition at various sites in Japan.&nbsp;

</p><p>The response so far has been impressive:&nbsp;

</p><p>“I think that Palestinian children bare hardships beyond imagination.”&nbsp;

</p><p>“We tend not to realize the meaning of ‘freedom’ until we are deprived
of it.&nbsp;
<br>I think that the situation in Palestine gives Japanese an opportunity
to reconsider&nbsp;
<br>what ‘freedom’ means.”&nbsp;

</p><p>“I hope and pray that those children’s trauma be cured as soon as possible.”&nbsp;
