<center><b><nobr><font face="Book Antiqua,Footlight MT Light"><font color="#000066"><font size="+1">Postgraduate
Diploma in Community Mental Health</font></font></font></nobr></b></center>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">&nbsp;</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The Post Graduate Diploma in Community Mental
Health, coordinated by the Training Department of the GCMHP, is the first
of its kind in the Middle East: a two-year, culturally sensitive, community-based
course designed to encourage professionals to explore theoretical concepts
and practical applications of community mental health and human rights.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The first year of the course provides participants
with training in state of the art theories, princ, and strategies of treatment
and prevention. Under the guidance of international and local trainers,
students complete ten core modules: Child/Adolescent Mental Health; Social
Psychology; Clinical Psychiatry; Communication and Counseling; Culture
and Mental Health; Trauma, Stress and Coping; Clinical Psychology; Research
Methodology; Community Mental Health; and Mental Health Education. During
the first year, students are also gradually exposed to clinical experience,
interacting with clients to offer support and emotional containment without
the demands of a specified therapeutic encounter. These experiences are
aimed at facilitating the integration of theoretical and clinical work
and the development of professional identity.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">During the second year, participants receive
a series of supervised clinical placements to explore the application of
their knowledge.<b> </b>Students carry an outpatient caseload of 4-6 patients
and provide therapy according to the needs of the patient. Over the year,
the students also complete six, two-month rotations. Four are core rotations
conducted by all of the students in the areas of child/adolescent, adult,
community, and family; two are elective rotations, in which students choose
to focus on women, geriatric, group, or other areas that interest them.
The program culminates with the completion of a final project, in which
the students integrate their theoretical and clinical training by writing
about a clinical experience or community issue in which they were involved.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The course is designed to encourage participants
to explore theoretical concepts in community mental health and human rights
in addition to their practical applications. Wide exposure to clinical
experience enables participants to discover their particular interest in
mental health and helps the transition from theoretical class-based study
to skilled and practical application within the community.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">Placed firmly within the philosophy of community-based
mental health, the Diploma emphasizes the shift from segregated and self-contained
mental health care systems within institutions to community-based therapy
and community involvement in health related issues. As such, the course
seeks to shift psychiatric therapy away from traditional Freudian concentration
on the individual and his unconscious motivational conflicts to move closer
towards an emphasis on social interpersonal care and the role of a person’s
environment. It also emphasizes the change in the role of mental health
professionals from being providers of mental health care to facilitators
of care, thus enabling individuals to solve their problems using the resources
of family and community institutions such as schools, mosques, etc. Finally,
the Diploma hopes to expose students to notions of human rights and to
highlight the links between mental health and human rights. No course in
mental health would be complete without an analysis of human rights and
the role that they play within the community.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">In February 1997, nine male and three female
students began the Postgraduate Diploma: one physician, two social workers,
and nine nurses. All theoretical courses will end in February 1998, when
the students will begin their practical training in the following institutions:
Palestinian Red Crescent Society, Child Development Center, Governmental
Psychiatric Hospital, National Association for the Rehabilitation of the
Handicapped, Right to Life Society for Children with Down’s Syndrome, Al-Wafa
Association for the Elderly, Deaf Children Center, and all three GCMHP
clinics. Also in 1998, a second group of twelve students (nine males, three
females) will begin the first year of the course: five physicians, three
nurses, three psychologists, and one rehabilitation specialist.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The Diploma course is coordinated by a Partnership
Council, including the GCMHP, the Islamic University of Gaza, and Oslo
University-Norway. Seven international universities contribute to the Postgraduate
Diploma Project by providing instructors for the various modules: Edinburgh
University-UK, Flinders University-Australia, Oslo University-Norway, University
of California at San Francisco-USA, Tel Aviv University-Israel, Tunis University-Tunisia,
and Utrecht University-the Netherlands. Each of these universities also
has a representative on the Academic Board of the Diploma. While each university
has declared its involvement in and expressed its enthusiasm for the Diploma
Project, the Training Department is currently working to formalize links
between the universities and the GCMHP.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">In August 1997, the Academic Board held its
first meeting in Utrecht to evaluate the diploma and set a timetable for
1998. Feedback from the professors demonstrated that both the student’s
enthusiasm and the level of professional and administrative support were
extremely high. Many trainers noticed, however, that students were often
exhausted by the demands of work, because many would work in the morning
and take classes in the afternoon. In response, the Board decided to recruit
students to training posts and hire them for their period of study. By
including training posts and making the Diploma a full time project, the
GCMHP hopes to relieve some of the pressure on participants and to facilitate
their active participation in the learning process. The changes will be
implemented in 1998.</font></div>
