<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The Gaza Community Mental Health Programme
held its third international conference, “Health and Human Rights,” October
13-15, 1997 in the Rashad El-Shawwa Cultural Center in Gaza City, Palestine.
The conference brought together over 400 health professionals, scholars,
and activists from 24 countries around the world to discuss the relationship
between health, human rights, democracy and other ideals which contribute
to the individual self and community spirit.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">In his welcoming speech, <b><a href="/gcmhp.net/eyad/index.htm" style="">Dr.
Eyad El-Sarraj</a></b>, Director of the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme
and Commissioner General of the Palestinian Independent Commission for
Citizens’ Rights, referred to the nascent experience of Palestinian democracy
and the ongoing struggle to secure respect for Palestinian human rights.
He emphasized the need for Palestinians to press ahead with building democracy
and strengthening dialogue with the Palestinian Authority (PA).</font></div>


<p dir="LTR"><b><font size="+0">Dr. Kamal El-Shrafi</font>, </b>head of the
Monitoring and Human Rights Committee of the Palestinian Legislative Council
(PLC), then opened the conference by raising the question of how Palestinians
can move from backwardness and subordination toward pluralism and democracy.
Insisting that the PA, while not a fully sovereign state, must abide by
international standards of human rights, Dr. El-Shrafi detailed the close
relationship between health and human rights and community development
and poverty alleviation.

</p><p dir="LTR"><b>&nbsp;</b> Following the remarks of Dr. El-Sarraj and Dr.
El-Shrafi, <b>Dr. Jonathan Fine</b>, Former Executive Director of Physicians
for Human Rights, opened the plenary session with a paper on <i>The Unfinished
Task: Global Campaigning for Health and Human Rights</i>. Dr. Fine asserted
that over 1.5 billion people are suffering from degrading poverty throughout
the world and that some of them could be found only one kilometer from
the conference site. While governments neglect the poor, health professionals
should support every national health professional group committed to advancing
human rights, demonstrate unity and strength in asserting the universality
of their deepest beliefs, let the world community know their vision, and
consider what form a global movement for human rights will take.

</p><p dir="LTR"><b>Dr. James Welsh, </b>President of the Medical Department
of Amnesty International spoke on <i>Doctors Campaigning Against Human
Rights Violations</i>. Dr. Welsh declared that medical professionals can
help advance human rights through access to prisoners and those at risk,
use of medical skills to determine incidents of torture, influence, and
ethics. He then argued that medical professionals should protest more constructively,
create greater awareness of human rights, render practical assistance in
working with victims, and educate others more fully on crucial human rights
issues.

<div dir="LTR">In her discussion of <i>The United States, Human Rights,
and the Myth of the ‘Honest Broker’,</i></div>

<div dir="LTR"><b>Dr. Nancy Murray</b> of the Middle East Justice Network
and the Bill of Rights Education Project, dispelled the myth that the US
government acts as an ‘honest’ broker in the Middle East. She expressed
concern that the U.S. is interested only in meeting Israeli security requirements
and in keeping the talks going rather than in working toward the fulfillment
of agreements.</div>

<div dir="LTR">Three concurrent workshop sessions were held in the morning:
<i>Perspectives on Human Rights, Women’s Rights in Palestine, </i>and<i>
Children’s Rights</i>. In the afternoon, six workshops were held: <i>Medical
Ethics: The Case of Israel, Rehabilitating Survivors of Human Rights Violations,
Torture, Human Rights in Palestine, Forensic Psychiatry, </i>and<i> Rehabilitating
Survivors of Human Rights Violations</i>.</div>


<p dir="LTR">The second day Plenary Session was marred by the absence of
<b>Dr. Mustafa El-Barghouthi</b> of the Union of Palestinian Medical Relief
Committees. He was prevented by the Israeli authorities from traveling
to the conference in Gaza. Other Palestinians denied access were: Dr. Ahmad
Baker, Khalil Tuma (translator), Rana Nashashibi, Reema Shwaiki, Khalida
Jarrar, Khalid Batrawi, Ahmed Sayyad, and Vivian Khamis. Such absences
harmed the representation of West Bank Palestinians at such a very successful
conference. In addition, several Israelis were preventedfrom entering Gaza,
despite the fact that the GCMHP rigorously followed the procedure for obtaining
permits. These Israelis were: Lisa Fliegel, Charles Lenchner, Diana Mardi,
and Michal Schwartz. The Gaza Community Mental Health Programme (GCMHP)
and conference participants condemned the intransigence of Israeli authorities
involved in this matter. Freedom of travel is a basic human right that
is being withheld by the Israeli authorities on a variety of pretexts.

</p><p dir="LTR">In the Plenary Session, <b>Professor Bent Sorensen</b>, Vice-Chairman
of the UN Committee against Torture, presented a paper on <i>The UN Convention
against Torture and the Case of Israel</i>. In a scathing indictment of
the ongoing Israeli policy of torture, Professor Sorensen detailed Israeli
violations of the UN Convention against Torture and denounced the Landau
Commission report that allowed the use of torture under the euphemism “moderate
physical pressure” against detainees.

</p><p dir="LTR"><b>Dr. Adriaan Van Es </b>of the International Federation
of Health and Human Rights Organizations, delivered a speech entitled <i>UN
Special Rapporteurs on Health Professionals and Human Rights</i>. Dr. Van
Es expressed the concern that health professionals risk a great deal in
reporting human rights violations, but there is a real need to overcome
professional apathy and self-censorship. As a result, health professionals
need legal protection and strong organizational backing, which a UN rapporteur
could help meet.

<div dir="LTR"><b>Dr. Rami Heilbronn </b>of the Medical Foundation for
the Care of Victims of Torture spoke powerfully and movingly during a speech
entitled <i>Bystanding and Whistle-blowing</i>. He discussed the fragmentation
of Jewish identity over the last 100 years. Israel, he declared, is an
ethnocentric Jewish national state established to solve the persecution
of Jews in Europe and cultural problems pertaining to secular Jewish identity.
It solved neither. Furthermore, the suffering caused by Israel to Palestinians
is an inevitable outcome of Jewish ethnocentrism. In a moving tribute,
Heilbronn discussed the case of Mordechai Vanunu, an Israeli nuclear technician
who gave secret information about the Israeli nuclear program to the <i>London
Sunday Times</i>, for which he was kidnapped, arrested, and sentenced to
18 years in solitary confinement. Dr. Heilbronn argued that Vanunu moved
beyond his ethnocentric perspective into an anthropocentric identity and
consciousness when he blew the whistle on the secrets of the Dimona nuclear
facility in Israel. According to Heilbronn, he has transcended loyalty
to an ethnic group to a loyalty to humankind.</div>

<div dir="LTR">Three concurrent workshops were held in the morning: <i>Mental
Health and Human Rights, Violations of Women’s Rights, </i>and<i> Rehabilitating
Survivors of Human Rights Violations</i>. Six workshops were held in the
afternoon: <i>Mental Health and Human Rights, The Violation of Children’s
Rights, Public Education Strategies, Preventing Torture, The Media and
Human Rights, </i>and<i> The Violation of Children’s Rights.</i></div>

<div dir="LTR">The third morning Plenary Session brought together a distinguished
panel of health professionals, scholars, and social activists. Psychiatrist
and veteran African National Congress member</div>

<div dir="LTR"><b>Dr. Freddy Reddy</b> delivered a presentation on <i>Suppression
of Human Rights: Psychopathology </i>in which he asserted that over the
years doctors have contributed to tremendous wrongs, such as sterilization
and dubious theories about minority groups. Linking the experiences of
South Africa and the Gaza Strip, Dr. Reddy demonstrated that almost all
people in Gaza have suffered from violations of their human rights. Palestinian
children were the main victims and still suffer from Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder. The treatment of personal suffering resulting from trauma involves
a long process, but doctors and health personnel have an obligation to
help. Another ongoing problem for Gazans is unemployment as it destroys
self-respect and leads to despondency. He asserted, however, that people
will only take so much before they rise up against the suppression of their
rights.</div>

<div dir="LTR"><b>Dr. Juliet Van Eenwyk </b>of the Washington State Department
of Health spoke on <i>Epidemiology and Human Rights</i>. She asserted that
epidemiology can be used to improve health when people have been deprived
of their human rights. She then outlined a number of examples in which
epidemiology can help improve basic health conditions.</div>


<p dir="LTR"><b>Dr. Khadija Safwat </b>of the Middle Eastern and African
Research Centre - Wales spoke on <i>States and People under Siege: The
Political Economy of Collective Siege and Human Rights</i>. She declared
that all states are under some form of siege because of the reproduction
of capital, the lack of loyalty to the state, and the cross-boundary nature
of the flow of capital. Looking at the situation today as a series of sieges,
Dr. Safwat stated that Israel is an expensive ghetto that costs the West
and the US a great deal. As Jewish contributions to Israel start to decline,
Israel may develop a sense of coming under siege. As a result, it may be
less willing to inflict a siege on the Palestinian economy, although it
will have to compete economically with the Palestinian entity more and
more.

</p><p dir="LTR">The final speaker of the Plenary Session was <b>Dr. Abdel
Aziz El-Rantisi</b> of the Islamic University. Speaking on <i>Islam and
Human Rights,</i> Dr. El-Rantisi stated that ethics are to protect human
dignity and that Islam is the best means by which to protect human rights.
Under Islam, man can vote and attain public posts based on qualifications
and not corruption. Dr. El-Rantisi proceeded to discuss the protections
offered by Islam to members of minority religions and declared that the
best struggle is in speaking truth in front of an unjust leader. During
the question and answer session El-Rantisi stated that the Islam he had
spoken of was the one sent by God and agreed that there are currently no
good examples of Islamic governments for Palestinians to follow.

</p><p dir="LTR">An Awards Ceremony was held after the Plenary Session to honor
people and organizations that have contributed to the development of the
GCMHP and to the defense of Palestinian health and human rights. The recipients
of the awards were: <b>Dr. Haidar Abdel Shafi, Ruchama Marton, Inge Genefke,
Barbara Harrell-Bond, David Henley, Khader Shkirat, Rami Heilbronn, the
Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, the Union of Palestinian
Medical Relief Committees, Lea Tzemel, the Public Committee Against Torture
in Israel, and Federico Allodi.</b>

</p><p dir="LTR">Three concurrent workshops were held in the morning: <i>Children,
Public Education Strategies, </i>and<i> Women’s Rights</i>. Three workshops
were held in the afternoon: <i>Rehabilitating Survivors of Human Rights
Violations, Mental Health and Human Rights</i>, and <i>Ethics and Torture.</i>

</p><p dir="LTR">In the closing ceremony, <a href="/gcmhp.net/eyad/index.htm" style="">Dr.
Eyad El-Sarraj</a> sounded a call for the release of Prof. Fat’hi Suboh.*
In strident words, he invited the PA to base its strength on respect for
law and human rights; “only then,” he said, “would we gladly sacrifice
all we had for the Authority”. In the closing speech,
</p><div dir="LTR"><b>Riyad El-Za’noun</b>, the Palestinian Minister of Health,
called the participants “prophets”, and charged them with the mission of
returning to their homelands and resounding the call for justice and the
cry of injustice on behalf of the continuing Palestinian struggle. He closed
with a moving tribute to his mother, an 89-year-old woman who weeps for
the Palestinians massacred at El-Aqsa and Hebron as well as for the Israeli
victims of suicide bombings. “The Israelis have mothers too,” she says.
Za’noun related that when his mother asked him who the conference attendees
were, he told her, “They are people like you, who weep when Palestinians
die, who weep when Israelis die, and who rejoice when peace arrives”. <b>“Tell
them,” his mother replied, “Um Salim is with them”</b>.</div>

<div dir="LTR">After the closing ceremony, <b>Dr. Nabil Sha’ath</b>, PA
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, attended the closing
reception. He gave a speech to the participants in which he emphasized
the sincere efforts of the PA to improve the health and human rights situation
in Palestine. While describing the conference as a laoccasion, Dr. Sha’ath
assured that the PA will take the recommendations and ideas presented in
the conference into consideration.</div>

<div dir="LTR"><b>&nbsp;</b></div>

<div dir="LTR">In addition, a group of participants met <b>President Yasser
Arafat</b> and conveyed to him their support for the Palestinian people
in face of the Israeli human rights violations. Moreover, they stressed
the importance of the PA adopting the principles of democracy and human
rights as the basis of building a Palestinian civil society. Specifically,
the delegation asked the President to release Prof. Fat’hi Suboh immediately.
President Arafat thanked the participants for coming to Gaza, expressed
his support for the respect of human rights, and stated that instructions
were issued to the security branches to stop torture and abide by the law.
Finally, he promised that improving the human rights situation in the Palestinian
areas will be a priority for the PA and promised that Prof. Suboh would
be taken to court if charged.</div>
