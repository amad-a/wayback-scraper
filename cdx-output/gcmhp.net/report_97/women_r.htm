<div dir="LTR"><b>Women in Palestinian society not only face the continued
violence and hardships of foreign military occupation, they also confront
the force of the patriarchal structure of Palestinian society - especially
in Gaza, where the traditional family structure remains very powerful.
During the <i>intifada,</i> many Palestinian women were direct victims
of Israeli military violence – beaten, shot, arrested. In addition, they
faced the psychological and emotional damage of having fathers, husbands,
and brothers killed and imprisoned. Suddenly left on their own, women were
confronted with a society that had not prepared them with the necessary
life skills and education and restricted their personal freedoms. In the
post-Oslo period, a strict closure strangles the economy and drives up
unemployment rates while many thousands of severely tortured ex-prisoners
try to cope with their traumatic experiences inside Israeli and Palestinian
prisons. As a result, Palestinian society has seen a sharp rise in domestic
and social violence, much of which is directed against Palestinian women.</b></div>

<div dir="LTR"><b>The <a href="/gcmhp.net/women.htm" style="">Women’s
Empowerment Project</a> at the GCMHP was established in 1994 to empower
women through education, vocational training, therapy, legal counseling,
leadership training, and community networking. Through its various components,
the Project allows women to identify and address their most pressing community
and personal needs, thus helping women victims manage their psychological
problems and play an active role in Palestinian society.</b></div>


<p dir="LTR"><b>While some governmental and non-governmental relief programs
address the material needs of women, the lasting psychological effects
of suffering and violence have not been tackled. The Women’s Empowerment
Project seeks to address the psychological needs of women victims of violence
through its individual, family, and group psychotherapy sessions. During
1997, the Project held 195 psychosocial counseling sessions. In addition
to Project participants, 38 women and 4 children from the community received
psychosocial counseling. Beyond counseling and therapy, Project psychologists,
social workers, and community development leaders conduct home visits and
organize support groups.</b>

</p><p dir="LTR"><b>The primary goal of the Women’s Empowerment Project is
to enable women to attain the knowledge and skills necessary to take on
new roles in society. The Project provides several different types of educational
and training opportunities for Palestinian women:</b>
</p><ul>
<li>
<b><i>Education:</i> Recognizing the power that knowledge imparts, the
Project seeks to provide women with educational opportunities. Several
women receive assistance to continue their education at the universities
in Gaza. The Project also provides courses in computing, first , income-generation,
and food production. In addition, daily lectures over the last year have
addressed issues such as: Palestinian women’s role in the community; Women’s
right to divorce; Women’s right to custody; Forms of violence: verbal,
physical, sexual, and social; Women and personal status law; Violence against
women and prevention; Family planning; and lectures concerning women’s
health.</b></li>

<li>
<b><i>Vocational training:</i> Through vocational training, the Project
continues to provide women with the skills necessary to start income-generating
projects and achieve some economic independence. Depending on their needs
and interests, participants receive training in sewing and fashion design,
embroidery, knitting, glass paintings, ceramics, cooking, video, photography,
and framing.</b></li>

<li>
<b><i>Leadership training (Community development leaders): </i>Adopting
a “training the trainers” methodology, the Project held community leadership
training in Rafah in 1996 and the Beach Camp in 1997. This training included
modules on community health, counseling, first aid, conflict resolution,
leadership skills, training of trainers, data collection, and small project
management. Following their training, these leaders conducted needs assessment
surveys to better understand women’s needs and, in response, developed
and organized an advanced program to address those needs.</b></li>
</ul>

<div dir="LTR"><b>&nbsp;At the conclusion of this training in 1997, the
Women’s Empowerment Project established women’s centers in Rafah and the
Beach Camp to be run by the trained community leaders. The centers provide
psychosocial counseling, legal counseling, vocational training, legal literacy,
and community awareness campaigns. Women in need of psychotherapy are referred
to the other GCMHP clinics. In 1998, the Project will begin working toward
the establishment of a center in the middle area of the Gaza Strip.</b></div>

<div dir="LTR"><b>Another service provided to participants in the Women’s
Empowerment Project is free legal counseling. During 1997, the Project
conducted 90 legal counseling sessions and the legal advisor represented
many cases in Sharia Courts.</b></div>


<p dir="LTR"><b>The Women’s Empowerment Project is constantly expanding
its community network of information and support. Through public meetings,
workshops, community awareness campaigns, and several media outlets, the
Project addresses issues of women’s rights as well as other cultural and
social problems. During 1997, the Project held workshops that dealt with:
violence against women, the killing of women by family members to preserve
family honor, women’s rights to divorce, the law, its implementation, and
the difficulties women face inside courts. In January 1997, as part of
its community outreach work, the Project began coordinating with police
to provide policewomen with understanding and skills to help them deal
effectively with social problems in the local community. In addition, the
Project coordinates activities with governmental and non-governmental organizations
working with woman, health, and human rights.</b>

</p><p dir="LTR"><b>Also in 1997, the GCMHP Women’s Empowerment Project began
providing out-service training to people in the community. The Project
organized two courses for child care providers, one course for Palestinian
policewomen, and a rehabilitation program for women prisoners inside the
Gaza central prison.</b>

</p><p dir="LTR"><b>The position of women in Palestinian society remains particularly
vulnerable. With a seemingly overwhelming array of forces aligned against
them, over 500 Palestinian women have found support over the last two years
in the services of the Women’s Empowerment Project. These services have
helped many women overcome the effects of violence and play an active role
in society. As the Women’s Empowerment Project reaches more and more women,
its services become ever more significant in helping to affect the status
of women in the Gaza community</b><font size="-1">.</font>
