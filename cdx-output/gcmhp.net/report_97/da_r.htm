Abuse</font></font></font></b></center>


<p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">One of the often unrecognized results of the
Israeli occupation has been the spread of drug abuse throughout Palestine.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians working inside Israel have been surrounded
by a subculture engaged in large-scale drug use. In addition, the Israeli
occupation authorities turned a blind eye to the growth of dealers and
smugglers and encouraged the dissemination of illicit drugs within the
West Bank and Gaza Strip in what some people suspected to be a policy designed
to destroy the Palestinian individual and society.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The <i>intifada</i> shattered the network of
collaboration between Israeli and Palestinian drug dealers and Palestinian
militants induced the fear of physical, social, and psychological violence
into both dealers and users. As a result, drug use in Palestine decreased
considerably and many addicts sought help. Upon its establishment in 1990,
the GCMHP began providing treatment for drug addicts. When compared with
drug programs elsewhere, our approach to treatment has been very successful.
Of our 250 patients, we have had a success rate of 44% (11.2% cured and
32.8% improved), 29.1% no change, 10.8% relapsed, 7.2% dropped out, 4.8%
closed files, 3% died, and 1.2% referred elsewhere.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The Oslo process has resulted in drastic changes
in the context of drugs in Palestine. The fear of <i>intifada</i> militants
is gone; the network of Israeli and Palestinian dealers has been rebuilt;
the Egyptian laws being enforced by the PA in Gaza do not adequately address
drug abuse or distribution; the lack of a forensic lab makes investigations
for drugs impossible; soaring unemployment, rapidly dying dreams of peace,
political oppression, widespread PTSD, continued suffering, anger, frustration,
and despair have aggravated the inclination to reject society and take
refuge in drugs. While the strong family and religious structures in Gaza
and the stigma of shame attached to drugs still provide a check on the
rise of drug use, reports indicate that well over 5,000 people in Gaza
abuse drugs.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">One major consequence of these changes has been
a sharp decline in the number of addicts seeking treatment. As a result,
over the last two years the Drug Abuse Committee at the GCMHP has increasingly
engaged in community outreach aimed at prevention. Most of the Committee’s
activities are directed towards young men, the sector of Palestinian society
most vulnerable to drug addiction. In order to reach the largest number
of people, the Committee coordinates with the Ministry of Youth and Sport,
the National Guidance Commission, and the Ministry of Social Affairs, as
well as clubs, universities, mosques, political parties, and other institutions
that engage young Palestinian men.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The outreach activities of the Drug Abuse Committee
over the last two years include:</font>
</p><ul>
<li>
<font size="+0"><i>Public meetings</i>: The Drug Abuse Committee has held
24 public meetings, attended by 1700 people from the local community, to
address drug abuse, its consequences, treatment, and prevention. Two volunteer
support committees were established from the participants of the workshops.
These committees consist of religious leaders, teachers, community leaders,
nurses, police officers, advocates, and other members of the local community
interested in facilitating our work.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font size="+0"><i>Workshops</i>: The Committee organized three workshops,
“Preparing young leaders,” “Drug Abuse: Causes and Methods of Prevention,”
and “Drug Abuse: Reality and Solutions.” Attended by hundreds of representatives
of local organizations and institutions, these workshops provoked discussion
of critical issues related to drug abuse. In addition, members of the Committee
participated in workshops organized by other institutions.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font size="+0"><i>Lectures</i>: At public meetings and workshops, members
of the Committee have given lectures on topics such as “Drug Addiction
and its Risk to Palestinian Society,” “The Reasons for Drug Abuse,” “Drug
Abuse: Its Causes, Stages and Effects,” “The Reasons &amp; Psycho-social
Effects of Drug Addiction,” “Drug Addiction: Its Definition, Symptoms and
Social Effects on Students,” and “The Effects of Drug Addiction on the
Child and the Family.”</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font size="+0"><i>Media</i>: Members of the Drug Abuse Committee have published
four articles in local newspapers, given interviews for four television
programs, and taken part in five televised seminars on drug abuse. Further,
the Committee compiled and edited a manual for drug abuse that will be
published in 1998.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font size="+0"><i>Provision of aid</i>: In May 1997, the Drug Abuse Committee,
in coordination with the World Food Program, began providing aid to the
families of addicts involved in treatment.</font></li>
</ul>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">Drug abuse remains a serious issue that Palestine
will be forced to confront for years to come. Only with a major transformation
of the prevailing social, political, economic, and psychological contexts
in Palestine will the issue be resolved. In the meantime, the GCMHP is
actively engaged in helping the Palestinian community check the rising
tide of drug abuse through our emphasis on prevention.</font></div>
