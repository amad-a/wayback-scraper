<center><b><font face="Book Antiqua,Footlight MT Light"><font color="#000066"><font size="+1">Human
Rights</font></font></font></b></center>


<p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">&nbsp;</font> <font size="+0">A central characteristic
of the Palestinian experience over the last fifty years has been the systematic
violation of virtually every internationally recognized human right by
the Israeli government. Dispossession, forced migration, occupation, economic
siege, curfew, closure, confiscation, deportation, house demolition, night
raids, tear gas, beatings, “rubber” bullets… One of the most overt and
destructive Israeli abuses has been a thirty-year campaign of massive imprisonment
and systematic torture. Over 535,000 Palestinians have been detained since
the beginning of the occupation in 1967; 175,000 during the seven years
of the <i>intifada</i> alone (Solidarity International, 1997). In 1987,
the Israeli Landau Commission recommended the use of “moderate physical
pressure” during interrogations, thus making Israel the only state in the
world to legally sanction torture. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have
suffered brutal treatment at the hands of Israeli interrogators, leading
to disastrous psychological effects, not only on the individual victims,
but also on the Palestinian community as a whole.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">With its establishment in 1990, the GCMHP realized
the need to address these effects and has always placed an emphasis on
rehabilitating ex-prisoners and victims of human rights abuses. In 1994,
the GCMHP created the <a href="/gcmhp.net/hright.htm" style="">Human Rights</a>
Committee to address the needs of the thousands of ex-political prisoners
released in the aftermath of the Oslo agreement as well as those detained
by the Palestinian Authority due to their criticism of the peace process
or of the PA. New evidence of torture taking place within Palestinian Authority
prisons as well as other abuses of human rights by the PA makes an emphasis
on human rights all the more crucial.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">In order to facilitate the work of the Human
Rights Committee, the GCMHP worked throughout 1997 to initiate the Project
for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Human Rights Violations in January
1998. With a framework and a three-year plan, the Project will concentrate
on rehabilitating victims and decreasing the prevalence of human rights
violations in Palestine. The new structure will improve the effectiveness
of the GCMHP in addressing the pressing issue of human rights abuses.</font>
<br><a name="objectives"></a>

</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066"><font size="+0">The Human Rights Committee
has four main objectives:</font></font></b>
</p><ul>
<li>
<i><font size="+0">To improve the quality and quantity of treatment, counseling,
and therapy provided by the GCMHP staff to survivors of human rights violations</font></i><font size="+0">.
The GCMHP staff receives continuous, advanced training in mental health
and human rights including lectures by visiting professors, enrollment
in the GCMHP Post Graduate Diploma in Community Mental Health, membership
in a five-year GCMHP course in group therapy, pursuit of high degrees at
foreign universities, and countless workshops and lectures organized in
conjunction with the various committees, projects, and departments of the
GCMHP.</font></li>

<li>
<i><font size="+0">To increase the capacity of rehabilitating survivors of
human rights violations</font>. During the last year, the Project has treated
a total of 1272 direct and indirect victims of human rights abuses, including
225 new cases. With the new structure, the Programme will increase its
capacity to address over 300 new cases annually. Using a professional,
culturally sensitive approach, the GCMHP treats victims individually as
well as with their families, the indirect victims of human rights abuses.
Combining counseling with individual and group psychotherapy, occupational
therapy, play therapy, and, beginning in 1998 physiotherapy, the teams
of therapists, social workers, doctors, and psychiatrists address the particular
needs of each case. In addition, to improve the quality of treatment, the
rehabilitation teams receive a variety of supervision and evaluation from
professional psychiatrists and psychotherapists.</i></li>

<li>
<i>To increase the support given to survivors of human rights violations
by their institutions, enabling them to integrate survivors into society.
Over the last two years, the Human Rights Committee members have delivered
more than thirty lectures at public forums and participated in over thirty
workshops held by different organizations in Gaza. In addition, the Committee
has organized over ten workshops for members of the community, NGOs, and
support groups, such as the Red Cross/Red Crescent, the YMCA, the Ex-Prisoners
Rehabilitation Program, and the Zaqat Committee of the Ministry of the
Awqaf. Issues addressed include coping with trauma, post traumatic stress
disorder, conflict resolutions, family violence, violence against women,
mental health and mental illness, psychosocial effects of torture, and
violence in the Palestinian society.</i></li>

<li>
<i>To prevent the violation of human rights through training of police
officers and social workers. During the coming year, the Human Rights Committee
will place a new emphasis on prevention, the most effective method of dealing
with human rights abuses. The staff will engage in: workshops and training
about human rights for Palestinian police and members of the Palestinian
Authority; media campaigns and lectures to raise public awareness about
human rights; and training professionals in the early detection of mental
health problems related to torture and other human rights violations.</i></li>
</ul>

<div dir="LTR"><i>In 1998, the GCMHP’s new physiotherapy unit will begin
providing treatment to victims of human rights abuses. Physiotherapy helps
create balance and harmony between body and mind as well as helping to
heal certain physical problems, especially those related to muscles.</i></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The GCMHP has helped thousands of victims
deal with the effects of human rights abuses. It plays an active role in
the growing campaign to end such abuses. While the human rights situation
in Palestine remains precarious, the GCMHP hopes that its activities towards
rehabilitating survivors of human rights violations can help to counter
the continued abuses.</font></div>

<center><b><font face="Book Antiqua,Footlight MT Light"><font color="#000066"><font size="+1">Three
Times in Six Months: The Arrests of Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj</font></font></font></b></center>


<p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">In addition to his position as Director General
of the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme, <a href="/gcmhp.net/eyad/index.htm" style="">Dr
Eyad El-Sarraj</a> serves as Commissioner of the Palestinian Independent
Commission for Citizens’ Rights. The PICCRis a state institution charged
with monitoring and working towards the integration of human rights into
Palestinian legislation and institutions.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The mandate of the PICCR establishes that it
will work in an open, transparent relationship with the Palestinian Authority
in order to promote respect for the rights of Palestinian citizens. During
late 1995 and 1996, the PICCR encountered many difficulties in trying to
cooperate with the PA. Repeated attempts to contact the Attorney General
and the President regarding cases of death in detention, torture, and detention
without trial went unanswered.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">At a workshop on 6 December 1995, Dr. El-Sarraj
voiced concern that Palestinian Attorney General Khaled El-Qidra presented
a major obstacle to the fulfillment of PICCR tasks and responsibilities.
The PA responded to Dr. El-Sarraj’s criticism by arresting him the following
day. He was questioned, held in custody, interrogated, confronted by the
Attorney General, and asked to sign a statement that he would never expose
publicly or in any manner the PA, its symbols, or its members. Despite
his refusal to sign, Dr. El-Sarraj was released after nine hours in detention.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">Five months later, the Palestinian Authority
again arrested Dr. El-Sarraj for criticizing its practices. On 18 May 1996,
Dr. El-Sarraj was arrested after being quoted in an article in the New
York Times. He was held for 48 hours on charges of “slandering” the Palestinian
Authority. The State Security Court then extended his sentence for 15 days.
Amnesty International, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, the Palestine
Human Rights Information Centre, Al-Haq, Adameer Association, and many
other human rights organizations condemned the arrest of Dr. El-Sarraj,
considered him a “prisoner of conscience,” called for his release, and
demanded protection for the freedom of expression. After spending 8 days
in jail, Dr. El-Sarraj was released on 26 May. Asked to sign a statement
that he would abide by the law, Dr. El-Sarraj added a handwritten note
that he maintained his full freedom of expression. He was reminded that
he was liable to re-arrest.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">Two weeks later, on 9 June 1996, the PA arrested
Dr. El-Sarraj for the third time in six-months after he sent a critical
letter to President Arafat concerning an appearance by the President on
CNN. At the prison, Dr. El-Sarraj was beaten, locked in a cell 120cm x
250cm for 17 days, denied visits by his family and lawyers, and charged
with possession of hashish. During interrogations, one officer inquired
about the letter that Dr. El-Sarraj had written to the President. When
the Attorney General read about this in the proceedings, he angrily reprimanded
the officer and told him he was not supposed to ask such questions. With
no grounds for the possession charges, the PA charged Dr. El-Sarraj with
assaulting the officer who beat him the day he was arrested. On the fifth
day of his arrest Dr. El-Sarraj was taken to a military court, where he
was sentenced to an additional 15 days in prison. Again, an international
campaign emerged to secure the release of Dr. El-Sarraj. Organizations,
activists, professionals, politicians, and leaders around the world condemned
his imprisonment, called for his immediate release, and demanded that the
Palestinian Authority respect the freedom of expression. On 26 June, all
charges were dropped and Dr. El-Sarraj was released, after spending 17
days in jail.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The repeated arrests of Dr. El-Sarraj and lack
of respect for his freedom of expression clearly demonstrate the context
in which the GCMHP is forced to carry out its work. Such an atmosphere,
in which fear prevents people from expressing their thoughts and feelings,
makes it extremely difficult to conduct mental health work, especially
rehabilitating victims of violence. Fortunately, the exposure that the
arrests of Dr. El-Sarraj received has led to widespread realization of
the urgency to protect human rights in Palestine.</font></p></div>
