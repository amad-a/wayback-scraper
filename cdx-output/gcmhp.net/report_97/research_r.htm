<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">&nbsp;</font> <font size="+0">Although the <i>intifada</i>
brought thousands of reporters and scholars to Palestine, multiplying greatly
the amount of academic work done in Gaza, most of the research carried
out was of a political or sociological nature. Very few scholars have come
to Gaza to carry out field work and conduct research of a scientific nature.
Recognizing this deficiency, the GCMHP established the Research Department
in 1990.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">&nbsp;</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The <a href="/gcmhp.net/research.htm" style="">Research
Department</a> at the GCMHP investigates and analyzes the effects of violence
on individuals and families in order to aid the clinical staff in determining
the most effective methods of treatment. In addition, the GCMHP publishes
its research in international journals in hope that knowledge gained from
the experience in dealing with large-scale trauma in Gaza, particularly
among children, will be of use to mental health workers elsewhere.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">&nbsp;</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The Research Department focuses its attention
on urgent phenomena in Palestinian society, exploring the longitudinal
psychosocial effects of such traumatic events as torture, house demolitions,
and prison experience. In its research, the team accords certain priority
to highly vulnerable groups such as women and children. Therefore, the
research has focussed on four main areas: Children and Trauma, Victims
of Torture, Women and Families, and the Epidemiology of Psychosocial Problems.
As the Department prepares to expand in order to facilitate professional
work and to encourage research in Palestine, the ongoing projects of the
Research Department reflect the pressing needs of Palestinian society.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font size="+0">During the past two years, the Research Department
has continued to focus its work on Palestinian women, children, and political
prisoners. The Team completed and published five major studies in 1996
and 1997.</font></div>


<p dir="LTR"><font size="+0"><b>“Experiences of Torture and Ill-Treatment
and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms Among Palestinian Political
Prisoners,”</b> Eyad El-Sarraj, Raija-Leena Punamaki, Suhail Salmi, and
Derek Summerfield, <u>Journal of Traumatic Stress</u>, v. 9, n. 3, pp.
595-606, 1996.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The relationship between the nature and severity
of experiences of torture and ill- treatment and post traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) symptoms was studied in 550 male non help-seeking Palestinian
ex-political prisoners from the Gaza Strip. Results showed that the more
a prisoner had been exposed to physical, chemical and electric torture,
psychological ill-treatment and sensory deprivation or bombardment, the
more he subsequently suffered from intrusive re-experiencing, withdrawal,
numbness, and hyper-arousal. Existential problems were not related to torture
experiences. Furthermore, duration of imprisonment, health problems during
imprisonment, harassment during arrest and after release, family, marriage,
and economic difficulties all predicted intrusive re-experiences of trauma.
Also ex-prisoners who continued to be harassed by military authorities
and had economic problems suffered more from withdrawal, numbness, and
hyper-arousal than others.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0"><b>“The Relation Between Traumatic Experiences,
Activity, and Cognitive and Emotional Responses Among Palestinian Children,”</b>
Samir Qouta, Raija-Leena Punamaki, and <a href="/gcmhp.net/eyad/index.htm" style="">Eyad
El-Sarraj</a>, <u>International Journal of Psychology</u>, v. 30, pp. 289-304,
1996.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The relations between the level of traumatic
experiences, degree of active participation in the <i>intifada</i>, and
cognitive and emotional responses were studied among 108 Palestinian children
of 11-12 years of age in the Gaza Strip. The results showed that the more
traumatic experiences the children had and the more they participated in
the <i>intifada</i>, the more concentration, attention, and memory problems
they had. Traumatic experiences also increased neuroticism and risk-taking.
<i>Intifada</i> activity could not protect children from developing emotional
problems, as was originally assumed. The highest level of neuroticism was
found among active boys who were exposed to many traumatic experiences.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0"><b>“Prison Experiences and Coping Styles Among
Palestinian Men,”</b> Samir Qouta, Raija-Leena Punamaki, and Eyad El-Sarraj,
<u>Peace &amp; Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology</u>, v. 3, n. 1, pp.
19-36, 1996.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">This study aimed to describe different types
of prison experiences and to analyze their relations with background and
psychological variables. Seventy-nine male Palestinian ex-prisoners were
interviewed about their prison experiences, ways of coping, personality,
and psychological well-being. The results of qualitative analysis revealed
seven different types of prison experience. Only one of these reflected
exclusively negative feelings, characterized by suffering and disillusionment.
The others also included relatively rewarding perceptions characterized
as a struggle between strength and weakness, heroic fulfillment, developmental
tasks, a normative stage in a man’s life, growth in personal insight, and
a return to religion. Results showed that older men, town residents, and
those exposed to a high level of torture perceived the imprisonment more
as suffering and disillusionment than other men. Ex-prisoners who perceived
their experience as suffering and disillusionment typically coped by using
wishful thinking, avoidance, escape, and distraction. Torture and ill-treatment
increased wishful thinking and self-controlling as coping styles.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font size="+0">“Models of Traumatic Experiences and Children’s
Psychological Adjustment: The Roles Of Perceived Parenting and the Children’s
Own Resources and Activity,” </font></b><font size="+0">Raija-Leena Punamaki,
Samir Qouta, and Eyad El-Sarraj, <u>Child Development</u>, v. 64, n. 4,
pp. 718-728, 1997.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The relations between traumatic events, perceived
parenting styles, children’s resources, political activity, and psychological
adjustment were examined among 108 Palestinian boys and girls of 11-12
years of age. The results show that exposure to traumatic events increases
psychological adjustment problems directly and via two mediating paths.
First, the more traumatic events children experienced, the more negative
parenting they experienced. And the poorer they perceived parenting, the
more they suffered from high neuroticism and low self-esteem. Second, the
more traumatic events children experienced, the more political activity
they showed. And the more active they were, the more they suffered from
psychological adjustment problems. Good perceived parenting protected children’s
psychological adjustment by making them less vulnerable in two ways. First,
traumatic events decreased their intellectual, creative, and cognitive
resources, and lack of resources predicted many psychological adjustment
problems in a model excluding perceived parenting. Second, political activity
increased psychological adjustment problems in the same model, but not
in the model including parenting.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font size="+0">“Relationships between Traumatic Events,
Children’s Gender and Political Activity, and Perceptions of Parenting
Styles,”</font> </b>Raija-Leena Punamaki, Samir Qouta, and Eyad El-Sarraj,
<u>International Journal of Developmental Behavior</u>, v. 21, n. 1, pp.
91-109, 1997.

</p><p dir="LTR">The associations between traumatic events, children’s gender
and political activity, and parenting styles were examined among 108 Palestinians
of 11-12 years of age. The results showed that the more the children were
exposed to traumatic events, the more they perceived both their parents
as strictly disciplining, rejecting, and hostile, and their mothers as
more negatively evaluating. The boys perceived both their parents as treating
them more negatively than the girls did. Affectionate parenting, such as
intimacy and love, was not associated with traumatic events, and did not
vary according to the child’s gender or political activity. The gender
of the child affected the association between traumatic events, political
activity, and perceived parenting. Traumatic events increased perceived
parental rejection and hostility only among the boys, and perceived strict
disciplining only among the girls. Although politically active children
perceived both of their parents as more negative in general, in the families
exposed to a high level of traumatic events, passive boys perceived their
fathers as more rejecting and hostile than active boys did. It is suggested
that mothers and fathers rear girls restrictively and with greater attention,
and boys with rejection, when the family faces traumatic events. In exposed
families, fathers also tend to discourage boys’ political passivity and
apparently encourage activity
