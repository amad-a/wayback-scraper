<center><b><font face="Book Antiqua,Footlight MT Light"><font color="#000066"><font size="+1">Within
the Prison Walls</font></font></font></b></center>


<p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">In February 1996, Israel slammed shut the prison
doors, locking one million Palestinians within the teeming strip of land
behind the gates of Gaza. Unemployment climbed to nearly 70% as tens of
thousands were denied access to their jobs in Israel. With no means of
subsistence, people struggled day and night to put food on the table. With
a violent stranglehold, Israel devastated the economic, social, educational,
family, religious, and medical links with the West Bank, Israel, and the
outside world that help sustain life in Gaza. Tension mounted, violence
rose, and social pressure escalated, tearing at the community and suffocating
life. As the desperate conditions became an entrenched reality, the people
of Gaza expressed their absolute frustration: “There’s no work, no money,
no food.” The period of transition in Palestine had ended; the era of depression
began.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">From the day it imposed this strict closure
on Palestine, Israel has spent the last two years perpetrating a seemingly
endless string of hostilities, brutalizing the Palestinian people, vanquishing
faith in the Oslo process, besieging Gaza, and further depressing the agony
of Palestinian life. In May 1996, Israelis elected reactionary Benjamin
Netanyahu to lead a new right-wing government. Over the following year
and a half, that government has manipulated the fears and aspirations of
the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people, shattering any remaining
hope for peace. In September, Israel opened a tunnel under the Dome of
the Rock in Jerusalem, provoking clashes during which Israeli soldiers
killed 84 Palestinians and trampled the dreams of thousands. Laughing in
the face of international condemnation, Israel began to build an illegal
settlement on Jabal Abu Ghneim between Jerusalem and Bethlehem in March
1997. It seemed that there was nothing anyone could do. Hopelessness and
despair set in. And the Israeli war machine has continued its siege: land
confiscation has skyrocketed, settler violence has reached an all time
high, home demolition is on the rise, thousands of Palestinians have been
forced out of East Jerusalem, constant clashes have brought more and more
death to Palestine, promised redeployments have not occurred, settlement
building continues, and the closure remains. Although the official death
of Oslo has not yet been announced, in their hearts, in their minds, and
all around them the Palestinian people suffer the pain of broken dreams
of peace and freedom.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">Surrounded and squeezed from without, Palestinians
have also faced increasing pressure from the social, economic, and political
conditions within the prison walls. As closure strangles the economy, unemployment
and prices spiral upward, confining most Palestinians to a life of extreme
poverty and destitution. Stress and tension are abnormally high; many men
feel choked because confined, inadequate because they cannot provide for
their families. In stark contrast, the Palestinian Authority (PA) has abused
the resources it controls, provoking widespread charges of corruption.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">In addition, the PA seems unable to prevent
or respond to the constantly escalating series of Israeli hostilities or
even to resist pressure from Israel and the United States to abuse the
rights of the Palestinian people. Thousands have been imprisoned, many
tortured, and some even killed. Human rights activists, reporters, and
outspoken critics have faced imprisonment and harassment for raising concern
about PA policies. From December 1995 to June 1996, Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj,
General Director of the GCMHP was arrested three times for standing up
in defense of human rights for Palestinian in the course of his duty as
Commissioner of the Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens’ Rights.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">Surviving in such deplorable political and economic
conditions has torn at the fabric of the Palestinian community and the
mental health of the Palestinian people. Anger, frustration, annoyance,
inadequacy, fear, despondency, despair, failure, weakness, and hopelessness
plague the minds of the Palestinian people. This tremendous emotional suffering
remains bottled up because all avenues of release have been systematically
shut down. Such rage cannot be suppressed forever and has begun to find
an outlet in increased violence in Gaza. Hundreds of incidents of violence
between clans have been reported over the last two years. Domestic violence
has also reached unprecedented levels, reinforcing the structures of patriarchy
and battering Palestinian women and children. Drug use, suicide, child
labor, and divorce are all on the rise. Many people, especially the youth,
are searching for possible outlets to escape the rising pressure, the devastated
social, economic, political, and psychological conditions in which they
are trapped. Indeed, <b>Gaza has become a prison</b>. As the doors remain
tightly sealed and pressure builds from within, widespread depression has
overtaken a great many people.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">In this era of depression, the Gaza Community
Mental Health Programme strives to meet the changing mental health needs
of the Gaza community. Our special programs for women, children, victims
of human rights abuse, and drug addicts focus on the sectors of Palestinian
society that suffer the most violence, that face the most trauma. Prevention
is playing an increasingly important role in the work of the GCMHP, as
the various committees and projects reach out to the community through
media events, video production, public meetings, and public awareness campaigns.
Demonstrating that mental illness in the Palestinian context is a normal
reaction to abnormal conditions, the GCMHP hopes to overcome the stigma
attached to mental illness in order to encourage Palestinians to more freely
and openly deal with their problems.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">Facilitating the empowerment of women through
rehabilitation, education, and training has always played an essential
role in the work of the GCMHP. Over the last two years, our ‘training the
trainers’ approach, designed to increase the number and distribution of
such services, has generated impressive results. Training programs in Rafah
and the Beach Camp have helped dozens of women gain the knowledge and skills
which have allowed them to open new branches of the Women’s Empowerment
Project in their communities. These centers now provide rehabilitation,
education, and training to women throughout the Gaza Strip.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">The core work of the GCMHP remains addressing
the immediate mental health needs of a traumatized community. Treating
almost 1200 new patients annually, the GCMHP clinical staff addresses the
massive psychological afflictions of the Palestinian people. Despite the
increasingly difficult context in which we work, our medical teams have
achieved impressive success over the last two years.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">One reason for the success of our clinical staff
lies in the invaluable experience and training that they have received.
The GCMHP continuously provides workshops, seminars, study days, courses,
and many other training opportunities in order to increase the expertise
of our staff. In 1997, our training activities took a giant step forward
with the establishment of the first two-year Post Graduate Diploma in Community
Mental Health to provide advtraining in the theory and practice of community
mental health.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font size="+0">Under the current conditions of economic, political,
and social devastation, the mental health of the Palestinian community
is under siege. The mission of the GCMHP remains the same as ever: to address
the tremendous psychological suffering of the Palestinian people and to
enable the Gaza community to sustain the treatment and prevention of mental
disorders long into the future. Our success over the last two years encourages
us to continue. And the current situation demands that we reaffirm the
commitment to help our people overcome the psychological effects of violence
and confront the widespread despair and depression in which they are living.
Our commitment remains unconditional, our determination remains steadfast.
We will do all that we can to facilitate and support a healthy Palestinian
community.</font>
