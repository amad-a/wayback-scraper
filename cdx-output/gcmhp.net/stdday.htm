<p dir="LTR"><font face="Traditional Arabic">&nbsp;</font>The “Rehabilitating
Survivors of Human Rights Violations Project” organized a study day on
“Refugees’ Mental Health”. The study day was on the different aspects of
the psychosocial problems refugees suffer from as a result of expulsion
from the homeland and moving to a new living environment.

</p><p dir="LTR">Dr. Samir Qouta, Research Officer, initiated the day with
a lecture on “The Consequences of Uprooting: Palestinian Refugees” in which
he presented some Palestinian and international studies on refugees. Dr.
Qouta talked about some psychological phenomena of migration such as increased
levels of anxiety as well as some psychosomatic effects.

</p><p dir="LTR">Anwar Wadi, social worker, followed with a presentation on
“Refugees’ Psychological and Social Balance” which pointed out that, despite
the large number of refugees from different places and cultures, similar
factors affect their psychosocial equilibrium. He also talked about the
different stages of psychosocial balance and the difficulties refugees
face in a new environment.

</p><p dir="LTR">Dr. Abdel Aziz Thabit, Project Director followed Mr. Wadi
by giving a paper on “Mental Problems of Refugees and Non-refugees and
the Cultural Factors that Affect Coping”. He pointed to the problem exile
and the effects of losing family and possession on life in a new environment.
Dr. Thabit also talked about the Palestinian experience citing that wide
scale depression appeared in the first few years after the uprooting of
1948. He also stated that Palestinian refugees still have inner feelings
of victimization that in turn lead to the continuation of depression and
anxiety. Dr. Thabit then explained the cultural differences between refugees
and original inhabitants.

</p><p dir="LTR">Following the lectures, the floor was opened for discussion
on the various issues discussed, and it was agreed that more workshops
should be organized to discuss ways of solving refugees’ psychological
problems.
