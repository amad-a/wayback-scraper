Violence and Palestinian Children</b></div>


<p>Free Amsterdam University gave <b>Dr. Samir Qouta</b>, Director of Research at
GCMHP, a Ph.D. for research conducted on violence and Palestinian
children. The research centered on the effects of Israeli violence on
Palestinian children on the cognitive and emotional capacities of
children, and the relation between parents and children. The studies
pointed to the importance of taking measured to care for children's
mental well being as well as the family and social environment in which
they live through social support to them and their families. The studies
also indicated the importance of avoiding violence or watching violent
scenes on television.

</p><p>The university commended Dr. Qouta for these pioneer studies. Despite
accusations by pro-Israel lobbyists that the studies are politically
motivated and are propoganda, the university went ahead with the
dissertation defense and praised the highly scientific nature of the
studies despite their political implications.

</p><p>Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj, Chairman of the GCMHP Board of Directors, was
present at the defense. He stated that these studies are a clear
indication of the progress of Palestinian scientific research,
especially in the area of psychosocial sciences.
