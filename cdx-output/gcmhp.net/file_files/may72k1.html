<p><b>On 7 May 2001</b>, the Israeli army succeeded in liquidating another
potential terrorist. Thus saving the Israeli public from the danger this
potential terrorist may have caused.

</p><p>In the city of Khan Younis in the southern part of the Gaza Strip,
Israeli tanks shelled a densely populated civilian area. Four-MONTH old
Iman Hijo (picture attached below) was killed by shrapnel that entered
her abdomen and exited from her back. Iman is the youngest potential
TERRORIST killed by the Israeli army since the beginning of the
Intifada. Iman's mother, grandmother, as well as two dozen civilians
(mostly women and children) were injured in the shelling.

</p><p>No one has figured out how Iman was posing a threat to the lives of the
gunners, when she was in her mother's lap at the time.

</p><p>Iman's death comes exactly one week after Israeli shelling killed Malak
(3 years) and Shaheed (5 years) in the Palestinian City of Ramallah in
the West Bank.

</p><p>How many more children will be considered "collateral damage?" How many
killers will walk this earth free? How many Milosovic's will continue to
rule unhindered? I call upon you to contact the Israeli government,
American Administration, and the EU President to condemn this heinous
crime.
