<p><b>Across Palestine:  Patients Denied Medical Treatment as a Result of
Closure Imposed by Israeli Occupation Forces</b>

</p><p>For the past 2 and a half weeks the West Bank and Gaza have been under
'closure' by the occupying Israeli army.  Initially, the closure
entailed sealing off the Occupied Palestinian Territories from occupied
East Jerusalem and Israel. Permits allowing Palestinian to travel to or
through these areas were revoked, leading, inter alia, to cutting off
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. At a later stage, the closure was extended
to sealing the individual Palestinian cities, towns and villages in the
West Bank. All Palestinian locales are surrounded blockaded by Israeli
troops, and some are physically blocked with large blocks of concrete
placed on roads. Palestinians are thus being held prisoner in their
respective cities, towns and villages across the entire West Bank, and
are prevented from moving between them.

</p><p>In addition to being terrifying, intimidating and economically
suffocating, this imposed closure is a disaster for the health system.
The ill and injured, especially in rural areas, are unable to reach
hospitals, doctors' offices and pharmacies at a time when the need for
medical attention is at its utmost.  These closures do not make
allowance for any exceptional cases, and many Palestinians have died or
experienced avoidable deterioration in their condition due to the
refusal of the Israeli troops to allow them to reach medical
facilities.    Just this morning a man died as a result of the occupying
troops preventing him from leaving his village to receive dialysis
treatment at the hospital in Nablus. These same troops routinely prevent
ambulances from reaching the injured, often resulting in the death of
the victim.  Borders with Jordan and Egypt are closed, preventing
patients who need special treatment from reaching hospitals in these
countries. And these are only examples of hundreds, if not thousands, of
cases of unnecessary suffering imposed on those in need of medical
treatment.

</p><p>From my personal experience as a Psychiatrist in the West Bank city of
Ramallah, I can share the following:

<br>My regular patients live throughout the West Bank.  With the exception
of those living in Ramallah city proper, none of them can currently
reach my clinic, and I cannot reach them.   These are patients in urgent
need of medication and treatment and whose conditions are exacerbated by
-- or who relapse as a result of -- the severe distress caused by the
current security situation.  Many of them are sealed off in villages
that do not have a pharmacy, thus it is impossible for me even to phone
in prescriptions as a stop-gap measure.  In addition, in the areas that
are equipped with pharmacies, there is less and less medication
available due to the cut-off in supplies imposed by the closure.  For my
patients, the consequences are dire:    In the cases of psychotic
patients, without their medication and associated treatment, and
particularly under the current stressful circumstances, they present a
danger to themselves and those around them. Epileptics, who require
antiepileptic drugs to prevent possibly life-threatening seizures, are
in serious danger.  Patients suffering from depression and anxiety
disorders are likewise unable to obtain the medication and treatment
that they desperately need.  In these abysmal conditions, the risk of
suicide is rising dramatically. And the list goes on.

</p><p>My colleagues in the other various fields of medicine throughout the
West Bank and Gaza  have hundreds or thousands of disastrous tales of
their own.

</p><p>During this period, my offices receive at least 100 phone calls per day
from panicked patients and family members, desperate to obtain treatment
for themselves and/or their loved-one(s).  I am helpless to assist them
under the conditions of the closure.  We are all trapped and
vulnerable.    No patient and no doctor should EVER be placed in this
position of absolute helplessness if it is in any way avoidable.  In
this case, it is entirely avoidable.  The total closure  serves no
purpose to the occupying forces except as a form of terror and
intimidation and a show of power.  Even if the mythical excuse of
security were to have some merit, the indiscriminate and collective
suffering caused to innocent civilians is entirely disproportionate.

</p><p>In addition to being profoundly morally reprehensible, deliberately
causing suffering to the innocent ill and injured is a violation of a
vast array of international human rights norms. It effects everything
from the right to life, to the right to be free from cruel, inhuman and
degrading treatment and punishment, to the prohibition on collective
punishment, to the right to health. In its all-pervasive cruelty,
closure can be considered one of the most heinous instances of
ethnically-based mass persecution.
</p><p>
We appeal to the international community, and in particular to the
international medical community, to speak out actively and loudly
against this travesty. The Israeli medical community is under a special
obligation to act, as it is best placed to influence policy makers and
public opinion (letters/calls should be directed to, for example, the
Israeli Medical Association, the Israeli Ministry of Health, the Israeli
Prime Minister's office.  Contact information is below).

</p><p>Please also contact all interested parties and relevant authorities in
your area.

</p><p>Thank you for your interest and your assistance.   Please also see the
