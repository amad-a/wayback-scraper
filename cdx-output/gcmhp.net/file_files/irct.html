<p><b>IRCT Council Statement of Support for the Gaza Community Mental Health
Programme
</b>
</p><p>The International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT)
expresses its strong support and continued concern for the Directors and
Staff of the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme and for all those
directly, and indirectly, affected by the ongoing violence in Palestine.

</p><p>The IRCT remains extremely concerned and dismayed by the violence of the
past month, which sadly appears set to continue for the foreseeable
future.  The growing list of casualties, almost all Palestinian and many
of them young children, is deeply distressing.  The Israeli Government's
use of sophisticated machinery and weaponry against largely unarmed
Palestinian civilians has been completely disproportionate.  We condemn
the Israeli army's use of lethal ammunition and its apparent 'shoot to
kill' policy, in violation of the 4th Geneva Convention.

</p><p>The current fighting would appear to serve no purpose for either the
Israeli or the Palestinian leadership; in the long-term there is simply
no option for the two parties but to return to the negotiating table.
It is our earnest hope that this will indeed occur in the near future,
and that the recent visit of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,
Mary Robinson, to Israel and Palestine, and talks between President
Clinton, Mr Arafat and Mr Barak, will be first steps in that direction.

</p><p>The current conflict is creating fresh scars that will not only affect
the long-term well-being of the victims and their families, but will
place in jeopardy the long-term stability and health of the whole
Palestinian community in Gaza, to the detriment of both Palestinians and
Israelis.

</p><p>In this regard, the work the GCMHP is doing in raising community
awareness of mental health issues, and in treating the victims of human
rights abuses, is invaluable.  Please be assured of our ongoing support.




</p><p>Sincerely yours,


</p><p><b>Maria Pinou-Kalli, MD, President
<br>Jens Modvig, MD, Ph.D., Secretary General</b>
