<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;direction:ltr;
unicode-bidi:embed">By Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj</p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">Most
of the taxi drivers in Brussels are from Morocco. Therefore, I was surprised
that the driver that took me to the European Parliament was a Palestinian.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">Like
many Palestinians, “Muhammad” complained and expressed his feelings of
frustration at the past and apprehension about the future. His opinion on the
Palestinian Authority was harsh. My Italian friend and I tried to reduce the
severity of his attack.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">My
Italian friend said, “This talk about the Authority doesn’t help the Palestinian
cause. On the contrary, it depicts them as unable and not ready to build their
state.” She turned to me saying, “Your continuous, public criticism of human
rights violations and corruption puts us, your friends, in a difficult
situation.” She continued, “As much as I share your principles, I ask you to
reduce the severity of your tone and concentrate on internal building without
public criticism, which hurts you.”</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">My
Italian friend has spent her life fighting for justice, always taking the side
of the oppressed. She has adopted the issues of the Palestinian and Kurdish
peoples, and is currently leading a campaign to lift the sanctions against
Iraq. Like other friends of the Palestinian people, she is disappointed in the
stumbling performance of the Palestinian Authority. Nonetheless, she continues
to campaign for support of the Palestinian issue. Lately, she organized a trip
for about one thousand Italian youth to visit Palestine. Representing all
Italian municipalities, they visited different places including Bethlehem,
Jerusalem, Hebron, and Gaza.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">My
friend, Louisa, thinks that many of these youth went back to Italy with a clear
picture of the Palestinian question, the oppressed people, and their right to
justice. They will be new messengers informing their people and friends of what
they saw. She whispered in my ear, “Unfortunately, some Palestinians wrote
critically of the trip without fully understanding its meaning and
consequences.”</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">Then,
she jokingly said, “You Palestinians and like Italians in the south. If three
meet to discuss an issue, they come out with five opinions.”</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">One
of her campaigns is undertaking a decision by the European Parliament to
boycott of products of Israeli settlements. She informed me that after the
decision was adopted, it came to her knowledge that these products are still
exported to Europe. When she declared this in Parliament, one of the members
asked her for evidence. Charles Shammas, an activist, conducted a quick tour in
Europe and came back to the Parliament carrying products of settlement sold in
different European capitals. And so, Louisa presented the evidence.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">“We
are fighting a battle in Parliament and in the street for the rights of the
Palestinian people and against occupation and racism. We do it out of belief in
our human duty and in line with justice.” Another time, she whispered in my
ear, “We miss Palestinian Ambassador Afif Safia. He was great with his contacts
with members of Parliament, the EC, politicians, and intellectuals. He was full
of energy like your Ambassador in Paris, Layla Shaheed.”</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">A
few weeks ago, my friend was in Sabra and Shatila raising a monument for the
martyrs of the massacre. Tomorrow, she will lead a demonstration in Prague
against global economy. And after a week, she will lead a European delegation
to Baghdad to break the embargo against Iraq and to challenge American policy.
A few days ago, she opened the doors of Parliament to a Palestinian artist to
show his work about the homeland and exile.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">We
have many friends like this great lady, especially in Italy. They are very
valuable to us in supporting out just cause. I just wish that some of the
Palestinian officials carried the same eagerness, commitment, and willingness
to give.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">When
I said goodbye to her after a few days full of meetings and discussion, she
said with clear determination, “You have an opportunity to reach a peace
agreement and build a state. Do not waste it and let Israel confiscate your
land and livelihood. Grab the opportunity before the whole area is overwhelmed
by radicals on both sides.”</p>
