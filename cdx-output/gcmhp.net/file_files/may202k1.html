<div align="left"><b><font size="+1">Dear Friends and Colleagues,</font></b></div>

<p>I would like to draw your attention to the attached appeal issued by the

</p><p>Union of Health Work Committees, the parent organization of Al-Awda
hospital in Jabalia (in the Gaza Strip). Please note that Al-Awda
hospital is a very important health care provider operating in an area
that suffers from a severe lack in adequate medical facilities. Any
contributions to the hospital would be very well placed. I strongly
recommend contributing to Al-Awda.

</p><p><b>Sincerely yours,</b>

</p><p><b>Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj</b>
<br><b>Director-General</b>

<div align="center"><b></b><p><b>"Urgent Medical Aid Needed"
<br>Union of Health Work Committees
<br>(UHWC)</b></p></div>

<p>Since the eruption of Al-Aqsa Intifada, the economic and social
hardships of the Palestinian people have been accentuated. This has
deprived many people from the ability to cover the expenses of their
treatment at UHWC's Al-Awda Hospital in Jabalia, which offers its
services at low prices.

</p><p>Driven by our responsibility towards our people and to ensure medical
care for all that need it, UHWC has doubled the percentage of cases
treated for free at the hospital. However, this measure has taken its
toll on the Al-Awda's budget, and is threatening its ability to continue
to provide services.

</p><p>We urgently turn to you to help us through our "Patients' Support Fund"
in order to ensure the continuity of our services in an area that
suffers from a severe lack of qualified medical services. The daily
operating cost for one bed is 200 New Israeli Shekels (NIS); and the
monthly cost is 6,000 NIS (approximately $US 1,500).

</p><p>Your contribution to the hospital will make a difference in the lives of

</p><p>Palestinian patients. Please make your donations to Al-Awda to the
following bank accounts:

</p><p><b>Palestine International Bank</b>
<br><b>Gaza Branch</b>
<br><b>A\C: 01/21/6-0108974/003/0492</b>

</p><p><b>Arab Bank</b>
<br><b>Gaza Branch</b>
<br><b>A\C: 9500-470-7-510</b>
<br><b>Swift Code: ARABPS22500</b>

</p><p><b>In addition, please distribute this as widely as possible. We need all
the help we can get.</b>

</p><p><b>Sincerely,</b>

</p><p><b>Dr. Rabah Muhana</b>
<br><b>Chairman of the Board</b>
<br><b>UHWC</b>
