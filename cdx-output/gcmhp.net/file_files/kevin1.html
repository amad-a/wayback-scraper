<p>I am American, in the Gaza Strip on winter break from my studies in anthropology/sociology and forced migration at the American University in Cairo. I am funded on a small grant by the Joint Steering Committee on Forced Migration/Refugee Studies at AUC, to intern with the Gaza Community Mental Health Program, under the supervision of Dr. Samir Qouta, Director of Research for GCMHP, facilitated with the assistance of AUC Sociologist Dr. Rabab Abdulhadi. 

  </p><p>The international holiday of "New Year's Day" has just passed, and many people in Gaza are busy staying warm as cold weather has ascended on Gaza City. Last night, a heavy thunder and lighting rainstorm passed over the shore. It was hard to tell whether there was tank fire near a settlement of just the boom of thunder. Both could be possible given the circumstances of current life in the Gaza Strip. 

</p><p>Having been raised in coastal New England, in the United States, I am right at home with the landscape of the Strip. Gaza City is a comfortable, upbeat and friendly place for an "outsider" to be. The sea reminds all Gazans' of its close proximity, offering a soothing front to daily life. The smell of the Mediterranean sea, the sight of the port, and the soft sand that gives its name to the local neighborhood "Al-Rimal" (sand or soil in Arabic) inspires a sense of hope in me that Palestinians have the resources they need to create their own lives out of the subjugation by others and themselves. Currently, such a scenario is my own personal wish, one very similar to the wishes of many others, hoping for Palestinian people of the Occupied Territories to turn a new corner in the year 2001. In my culture, it is tradition at this time of year to conjure up notions of what positive change can occur in one's self and society. From being in the Gaza Strip, it is not difficult to know that most people here seek change with far greater persistence my culturally prompted New Year's hope will convey. 

</p><p>My impressions, derived from my interactions from people in community of Rimal and Gaza City, are that people are awaiting the opportunity for normalcy, regularity and a chance at the subsequent human development that occurs when people are able to self-direct their lives. Some might call such self-direction autonomy, actualization or control over one's own destiny. In my personal worldview, these are important facets of life, as they encourage the potential for choice and achievement. All graduate students and professional researchers bring to their research their own understanding of the way the "world should be". Perhaps research for some is the chance to make some things "right". I subscribe to the notion that "if you want peace, you must work for justice". This value is what brought me to spend winter break in the Strip.  I believe justice is possible when people live well, whole lives, in reciprocal relationships. Dr. Elizabeth Colson raises the matter of reciprocity and intra/inter-community relations and the synergy created out of the balance that occurs when people mutually value each other (1999?) I am no rocket scientist for promoting the idea that people who are mastered cannot engage in reciprocity to the extent, if at all, that is desirable in healthy human relations. 


</p><p>Anthropologist Serena Nanda states that Anthropology is about "impression management". In my training in the Refugee Studies program at the American University in Cairo, I have learned from Anthropologist Dr. Barbara Harrell-Bond that impressions are powerful because of their subjectivity. All types of impressions affect refugees (2000).  Impressions are subjective, as they are contingent on the needs and intentions of the "perceiver" or originator of an "impression" and of the receiver of the impression. Impressions and refugees have a lot to do with notions of helping, including the who, what why, how and when of assisting people (Harrell-Bond, 2000.) I chose to research the Gaza Strip because of the impressions that abound regarding this small edge of the Eastern Mediterranean.  What must a place so burdened with negative images and perceptions, as is the Gaza Strip, look and feel like? My undergraduate training in Geography has taught me a lot about "reading the landscape". I impressed with the natural beauty of Gaza. There is abundant flora here. The sea provides freshness to the air. The roads along the beach are scenic and pleasant. Having come to Gaza City for the second time this year, I feel, perceive and understand with certainty that as sure as the waves of the Mediterranean will crash every few seconds on the shore of al-mena,  Palestinian refugees of the Gaza Strip will be waiting with a similar assuredness to get on with their Post-displacement, Post-Intifada, Post-Occupation, Post-Oslo, Post-PNA, Post- last minute Barak-Arafat-Clinton "solution" lives. 

</p><p>AUC Anthropologist Dr. Anita Fabos, whose unpublished notes on liminality (2000), discussed in a class lecture on the topic, informed my impressions about refugees here in Gaza. "Liminality" as Dr. Fabos's framework of understanding liminality is relevant to  deconstructing the backdrop of encamped refugees' lives. Liminality occurs across all time and space, and in all cultures, and is therefore a signficant piece of the "contextual" pie that Urie Brofennbrenner emphasizes in his writings about human beings and their development. 

 </p><p>Liminality is about the actuality of life "betwixt and between" one state of being and another. Simply put, waiting to get from place "A" to "B". Long-term liminality can cause enormous duress and force people to alter their typical and preferred way of life in order to adapt to the idleness and stagnation that enduring liminality creates. 

</p><p>Anyone's read on the political circumstances of the Palestinians in Gaza, in particular, those living in the camps, would surely surmise that the arrival of the new year brings with it enormous political uncertainty. I have visited Deir al- Balah and Beach Camp in September of 2000.  Yesterday, on my way to a lecture at Al-Quds University School of Public Health with Dr. Samir Qoutis, we witnessed the funeral procession of another Gazan killed in the fighting between Israeli Defense Forces and Palestinians.  From the back seat of an automobile, I observed many poor people, some selling produce, aged men in traditional Palestinian white kuffeyiahs' and women orderly engaged in a public expression of their grief at the loss of another neighbor, father, brother, uncle, or fellow human being. I was astonished at some of the poverty in Jabalya. I was also equally astonished with the potential human resources that are, in my impression, marred by poverty and oppression there. I asked Dr. Qouta if it would be ok to take pictures, and he said that it would be no problem. I wondered, in the midst of all the chaos that is the political future of the people of Gaza,  how I could be greeted with kindness and warmth, being a khawaja min Amrika (foriegner from the US)? I am inspired by the human capacity I have witnessed in Palestinians to transcend the very real possibility, that  to some Palestinians,  "America"  and "Americans" are an "enemy". 

</p><p>Alternatively, It would not be difficult for me in my observations of this community under siege, being a graduate student in the social sciences, to get carried away with hypotheses of how the people of the Gaza Strip as a society will experience pathology in their complicated lives. As a student of the social sciences, I draw most deeply from the paradigm of humanism. Therefore, I believe that people demonstrate daily the capacity to improve their lives in positive ways.  My experience in the Gaza Strip, with the people who live here, has been wholly positive. 

</p><p>In my experience in studying the Israeli-Palestinian quaqumire, I have often heard North Americans remark that the Palestinians "need to move on" or "get over it" regarding their stateless status.  I have observed among the Palestinians I have met here in the Gaza Strip a very strong desire to "get on with it". The Palestinians I have met want to build whole lives, not just a state. It is my impression of people from the Strip I have met here want to have jobs, and a right to return to what I interpret from talking to people, is the return to "resources".  The people of the camps, the women and the children, have long born the brunt of the resistance movements attempts to achieve their political aims. The quality of peoples lives remains in serious jeopardy given the in-between nature of the experience of refugees in the Gaza Strip.  It is easily witnessed in daily life here in "Ghazzaa" (as said in Arabic) that citizens of this land have enormous internal resources. I perceive that people lack social, economic and political power to restore a sense of equilibrium to their lives. The kids one sees running along the sidewalks impress me as naturally inclined to shout an enthusiastic "Hallo" or toss a football about than they are to throw stones or engage in warfare.  

</p><p>Anthropologists can rightfully be accused of "romanticising" the people they study, as Dr. Harrell-Bond wisely reminded me upon my first trip back from the Gaza Strip.  I am aware that no people are irreproachable, which in fact, in my view is what makes the work of the GCMHP so essential. It is my impression that when people seek support and well being, they are inherently taking responsibility for their lives and the futures of those around them. 

</p><p>It seems that any refugee, including the Palestinans, subjugated to to an open-ended waiting game, albeit different, yet similar as many refugees are, find that the life of a refugee may become focused on the hard work of sheer survival. At what cost to the entire global society does hampering the personal development of all people labelled "refugee"come,  no exception being the Palestinan refugees of the Gaza Strip?  It seems to me  that what the Palestinians I have met in my encounter in the Strip as an intern with the Gaza Community Mental Health Project want the most, is a typical life.  

</p><p>I dedicate this writing to Anthropologists, Drs. Carolyn and Richard Fluehr-Lobban, for teaching me that I had what it takes to work for justice, and peace, first by finding it inside.
