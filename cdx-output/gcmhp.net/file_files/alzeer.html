<p>On 26 May 2001, Mohammad El-Zeer (GCMHP Community Mental Health
Specialist) successfully defended his MA entitled "Long-term Effects of
Torture on Palestinian Prisoners and their Relation to some Variables"
in the Islamic University. After the defense, Mr. El-Zeer was awarded
the MA degree in psychology. The study called for strict laws outlawing
torture in Palestinian society. It also called for periodic checkups on
survivors of torture in order to make sure that they do not suffer from
the effects of torture.
