<p><b>On 22 February 2001</b>, Dr. Sabry Saidam, Project Officer of Welfare Association, and Mr. Abdel Hamid Afana, GCMHP Deputy Director for Administrative and Financial Affairs, signed a cooperation agreement between the two organizations. Under this agreement, the Welfare Association agreed to fund GCMHP activities in the area of counseling for children in schools and kindergartens as well as training workshops for teachers in the area of crisis intervention and dealing with children in difficult circumstances.

<p>Dr. Saidam pointed that fund is part of the "Fund to Support Victims of Al-Aqsa Intifada" that was established by the Welfare Association. The Fund plans to work in two stages. The first stage is for support for widows of martyrs, health institutions, and mental health services. The second stage focuses on support for people handicapped during the Intifada and rehabilitating them.  Also, he indicated that the main factor that played in providing this contribution to GCMHP was the Porgramme's high level of professionalism and the urgent need of Palestinians for competent community mental health services. 

</p><p>It is worth mentioning that GCMHP offers a variety of services to victims of Israeli violence. These services include psychotherapy and counseling to all sectors of the population with special emphasis on children. In addition, the Programme opened a free telephone counseling service, and conducts training programs for school and kindergarten teachers.
