<p><b>Delegation from the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs Visits GCMHP
</b>


</p><p>On 19 November, Professor Marcel Kurpershoek, the Director of the Middle
East and North Africa Department in the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign
Affairs visited GCMHP. The Head of the Netherlands Representative Office
to the PNA, Mr. Ron Muyzert, accompanied Professor Kurpershoek during
the visit. Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj and Dr. Ahmad Abu Tawahina met the guests
and gave them an overview of the difficulties facing the Palestinian
people on the psychosocial, economic, and political levels. The hosts
also asked the European governments to put more pressure on Israel to
stop its violation of Palestinian rights.

</p><p>The guests expressed their willingness to study the possibility of
funding the Programme's activities in the area of training and
education, which constitute an important aspect of GCMHP's work. Dr.
El-Sarraj indicated that the Programme's training expertise has been
sought by agencies in Algeria, Lebanon, and Bangladesh. Therefore, there
is a need to expand these activities.
