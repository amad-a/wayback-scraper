<p>A team of GCMHP workers went to see the family of Najjar in Khanyounis following Israeli air raid to investigate the impact and to support the family.

</p><p>Background: On the evening of 20the November 2000 at 6:30 pm, the family home in Khan Younis was exposed to the Israeli attack by military planes. This attack resulted in massive destruction of the family building. All the family members suffered psychological trauma and four of them were injured due to the crushed glass windows. 
  
 </p><p>During the visit, we met the following:
Ahmed 15 years old, Heba 9 years old, Noura 18 years old and Iman 16 years old


</p><p>In the ground floor of the building, we sat with the children who were extremely frightened and scared.  Ahmed talked about the attack saying that his family and he were in their balcony watching the Israeli planes while they were bombing a security base -which is about three km-. Suddenly they saw one of the missiles turn to destroy the first floor of their home. "After that explosion and the splitted pieces of broken glass injured us and I fell down on the ground". Ahmad said "I was so scared and I heard my mother saying Al shahaditeen (Muslim part of religion as preparation for death) and I did so. The electric current was off so I could not see my sisters thus I started screaming and called each with her name. I creeped on the floor to reach my mother who was in the other room shouting.  We tried to ask for help while moving out of the building. My mother hugged us while we were sitting under a tree waiting the ambulance. .

</p><p>Ahmed failed to sleep all the night although he was exhausted. He looked anxious and worried about the rest of his family who were unable to reach him in the hospital because of the Israeli closure between the areas. Jumanh, who was injured in the same attack, said, "I did not expect what happened, planes were there before but no shooting occurred. We live away from any Security force centers. I could not realize the situation, what I could remember is falling down while calling my father for help. My father was not there so I called my mother and my siblings. I felt scared while evacuating to the lower stairs in the dark.  I felt dizzy and my foot was bleeding. I joined my family who was sitting under a tree while waiting the ambulance, however I kept screaming and shouting loudly. My sister Noura was screaming too and the blood was covering her face. 

</p><p>Jumana, the little child, is now expecting a daily attack and keeps asking about her family in particular her father who did not come till now.

</p><p>Heba, the other child, described her experience by saying that "Suddenly I felt my self fainting and falling down. Hard object hit me and hurt my shoulders, I gripped my mother who carried me inside the home. I kept shouting all the time and my entire body was exhausted. Then I was left with my neighbor, as my family was transfered to the hospital. I was frightened and so I could not sleep all the night."

</p><p>It is clear that the children are suffering severe post-traumatic shock. They were extremely anxious, scared and irritable. The children looked shocked and the bloody spots on the stairs attracted their attention. 

</p><p>We tried our best to comfort them and to help them to reflect on their experience. We showed them our concern and care and they show acceptance. Arrangement for further visits was done and telephone numbers were exchanged. We advised the family elders to communicate with the children, allow them to express their selves, to give accurate information and to give them a feeling of security.
