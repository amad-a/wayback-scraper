<p>The nature of the work of the GCMHP requires constant contact -
academic, political, and social - with many other public organisations
and governmental institutions. Publicity, in terms of raising the
international profile of mental health issues in Gaza, is also an
important part of the work of many of the departments. The Public
Relations Department therefore plays a central role in the Programme.

</p><p>The Public Relations department is responsible for creating and
maintaining relations with  international organisations, governments,
and individuals, as well as with local NGOs. The GCMHP is a founding
member of the Palestinian Non-Governmental Organisations Network (PNGO),
a committee established to coordinate between NGOs on one hand, and
legislate between NGOs and the Palestinian National Authority on the
other.

</p><p>The biannual international conferences are one of the highlights of the
work of the GCMHP. The PR department organises the logistics and details
of these events. The aim of the conferences are to encourage scientific
exchange and cooperation which leads to opportunities for education,
research, and funding.

</p><p>The department has organized 5 international conferences since the
establishemen of the Programme. The last two have been in 1998 and 1999.
In December 1998,  the Programme hosted the 6th International Research
and Advisory Panel (IRAP) Conference on Forced Migration. Despite a
last-minute change of venue from Gaza to Jerusalem due to President
Clinton's visit to Gaza, the conference was a success, with 60 speakers
and attended by 180 professionals from all over the world in the field
of migration.

</p><p>Between 21-23 November 1999, the Programme held its fourth international
conference, on "Women in Palestine". In the struggle for freedom, many
women's issues have been left undiscussed. This conference themes
included gender and development, women in Islam, women and human rights,
and the role of women in the developing community. About 800
participants attended, including about 150 international visitors.

</p><p>As well as international links, the Public Relations department
emphasises the place of the GCMHP within the local community. In May
1998, the magazine "Amwaj" (Waves) was launched. This is a pioneer
project in raising local awareness and combating stigma as it is the
only magazine devoted to mental health issues in Palestine. Edited by
Husam El-Nounou and Eyad El Hassani, it comes out once every two months.
Most articles are by GCMHP staff, about a range of issues concerned with
mental health in the community. "Amwaj" ends with a discussion of a
specific concern, such as suicide or violence against women. The
magazine is aimed at the local community: it is distributed to
governmental institutions and NGOs, as well as professionals working in
fields related to mental health in Gaza.

</p><p>The department compiles, edits, and publishes the GCMHP monthly report
and annual report that cover the different activities. The last annual
report is posted on the web site. The department issues press releases
and statements upon recent political developments. It updates the web
site with material on various GCMHP activities.

</p><p>Another important aspect of the PR department's work is hosting
visitors. Local, regional, and international visitors come to GCMHP; and
the department facilitates their visits. The facilitation includes
providing the necessary information about the Programme and the general
situation, field visits to get acquainted with the living conditions and
culture of the Palestinian people, and logistic arrangements if
necessary.
