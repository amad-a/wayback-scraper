<p>“I was on the floor, protecting my head- three men were beating me on my head and body. 
They sprayed gas on my face. I thought I was going to die. I could not breathe. One of the 
policemen started stomping his boot on my hand and I was bleeding… then they put me on the 
bed, tied my hands and legs- all the while beating me- and held my head and neck, choking 
me.” 

</p><p>This how Amneh Muna, a 25-year old Palestinian female political prisoner, described part of a 
beating episode at the hands (and feet) of Israeli prison wardens (in Abu Qbir prison) in the 
evening of 13 September 2001. 

</p><p>Mr. Issa Qaraqe’, General Director of the Palestinian Prisoners Club, stated, “Amneh was 
transferred to an isolated cell without any access to sun or proper ventilation.” He added, “She 
was brutally beaten. Even though her finger was broken, she did not receive any medical 
treatment.” 

</p><p>According to information obtained via the Women’s Affairs Technical Committee (WATC), 
that same evening witnessed the beating of another five Palestinian female political prisoners. 
They are Maha Al-Ekk(24 years), Abeer Amro (20 years), Su’ad Ghazal (18 years), Wujdan 
Bujeh (22 years), and Rabi’a Hamayel (15 years). The Israeli prison wardens followed the 
beatings by tying them to their beds in the same manner in which Amneh Muna was tied. 

</p><p>On the situation of female Palestinian political prisoners, Ms. Najah Duqmaq, a lawyer in the 
Mandela Institute for Human Rights, stressed that the conditions of female prisons have 
severely deteriorated. She stated, “In the last four months, the Palestinian female detainees 
have been attacked and beaten four time”. She also emphasized that the detainees are 
deprived of family visits and meeting with Palestinian lawyers from the West Bank or Gaza 
Strip. “Israeli authorities refuse to issue permits to Palestinian lawyers to travel into Israel in 
order to visit their clients incarcerated in Israeli facilities. Palestinian lawyers are also barred 
from representing Palestinian prisoners in front of Israeli courts”, she added. 

</p><p>According to WATC, in the past four months, numerous human rights organizations have 
reported that male and female wardens and riot police have brutally attacked and tortured 
Palestinian women detainees on several occasions, causing them severe injuries and lacerations 
on their bodies, not to mention sexually degrading them. Moreover, WATC notes that 
investigative reports have also revealed that nurses and medics in these detention centers have 
not sufficiently reported the abuse and torture inflicted on the detainees. Rather, they have 
participated in covering up the violence. 

</p><p>In light of the grave situation of female Palestinian prisoners, and the serious human rights 
violations they are subjected to at the hands of Israelis, GCMHP calls upon governments and 
nongovernmental organizations, human rights organizations and activists, and advocates of 
justice to condemn the barbaric treatment of female Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons. 

</p><p>Please send appeals and protests to any number of the following officials reminding them , 
among other things, that according to the United Nations Standard Minimum rules for the 
Treatment of Prisoners, Article 33, “Instruments of restraint, such as handcuffs and chains shall 
never be applied as a punishment.” Moreover, Article 53 states, “Women prisoners shall be 
attended and supervised by women officers.”
