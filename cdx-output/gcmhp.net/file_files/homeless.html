<p>When you stand with us on the rubble of the house, you feel what we
feel. Your heart moves like ours. It is a homeless family. A mother
sitting opposite the rubble. Children jumping around the scene. All of
this makes you want to scream as loud as you can.

</p><p>Some neighbors and relatives gathered around us. Everyone wanted to
talk. Everyone wanted to express their anger and describe how the
Israelis destroyed this house without mercy towards its occupants,
without consideration for the tears of the children, without considering
the screams of the desperate woman trying to save what she can from the
furniture. But, the Israeli destruction machine doesn't heed feelings
and has no mercy for the weak.

</p><p>The family made a decision. They swore by every drop of sweat that went
into building the house and the tears of the children to stay in their
land even if their blood was mixed with the remains of the house.

</p><p>We came closer to the shocked woman. She studied us and said, "we woke
up in the middle of the night on the sound of gunfire and bulldozers.
The house shook violently and that scared us. We ran out of the house
screaming for help and trying to save the children. No one answered."
She complained about the fear, anxiety, and nightmares that the children
are suffering from, and her helplessness in trying to sooth them and
make them feel secure. She cried and our hearts pounded again.

</p><p>We are humans like them; but it is our fate to relieve people's burdens
without crying or complaining.

</p><p>Rain is coming with the accompanying cold and chill. The tents of the
Red Cross don't protect much from rain or cold. "The soldiers and their
machines of destruction are a few meters away. We are in the heart of
danger, in the lion's mouth, and the only protector is Allah. But we are
steadfast and we won't flee our land." We swear.

</p><p>The children started to come closer to us. It was an opportunity to
study their feelings and relieve them of anxiety, fear, and anger. They
talked about their fear of the soldiers who might come again. They
talked about their love for their home and their fear of moving away
from their friends. They said that the soldier told them that they
couldn't rebuild their home. We promised to meet again after providing
the necessary support to the family and children.
