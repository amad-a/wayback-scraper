<p><b>On 29 April 2001</b>, GCMHP and the Government of the Netherlands signed a
cooperation agreement, under which the Kingdom of the Netherlands funds
the Program's Training and Education Department. Mr. Ron Muyzert, Head
of the Netherlands Representative Office to the PNA, signed the
agreement on behalf of the Government of the Netherlands; and Dr. Eyad
El-Sarraj, GCMHP Director General, signed it on behalf of the Programme.

</p><p>On this occasion, Dr. El-Sarraj stated, "the relation between GCMHP and
the people of the Netherlands has been strong since the establishment of
the Programme in 1990, when the first international fund to GCMHP came
from the Netherlands. I am proud of the unique ties between the
Programme and the Netherlands representatives in Palestine and Dutch
Ministers of International Development and Foreign Affairs."

</p><p>It should be noted that GCMHP hosted the Dutch Minister for
International Development in the Programme on two occasions, in 1996 and
1998.

Mr. Abdel Hamid Afana, GCMHP Deputy Director for Administrative and
Financial Affairs and Director of Training and Education, stated that
this agreement emphasizes the strong ties between the Programme and the
Dutch people and government. He also said, "the Netherlands has always
supported the Palestinian people and democratic civil society
institutions. It has also granted substantial support to the PNA in the
areas of infrastructure, judiciary, planning, and the seaport.

</p><p>In its part, the Programme has also maintained strong ties with Dutch
academic institutions such as Utrecht University, who is represented by
Professor Wolters in the Academic Board of GCMHP's postgraduate diploma
in community mental health and human rights. In addition, Dr. Samir
Qouta, GCMHP Director of Research, acquired his Ph.D. with honors from
Amsterdam Free University a few months ago. Also, the Government of the
Netherlands and other Dutch organizations have supported GCMHP's work in
human rights and rehabilitation of torture survivors for years."

</p><p>Ms. Birgitta Tazelaar, the Desk Officer for Development Cooperation at
the Netherlands Representative Office to the PA, stated that, "the
Netherlands representative Office decided to support the Gaza Community
Mental Health Programme for a period of three years, starting from April
1, 2001. The Netherlands have gained experience with the GCMHP since
1995 through different projects and believes that the work the center
does is unique and has proven of great value to the Palestinian people.

</p><p>The Netherlands attaches great importance to Human Rights and gladly
supports organizations that promote human rights in every aspect. GCMHP
does so through its services and training in "Mental health and Human
Rights." Especially in these times, when so many children, men, and
women are suffering from distress because of the occupation and the
violence, the work of the center is needed even more than ever. The
Netherlands Government attaches great importance to the position and
well being of women, who have been denied so much. We value the work the
center does to empower Palestinian women so that they can participate on
an equal basis in the development of their society.

</p><p>Human rights (including women's rights), participation, dignity and
security are indispensable aspects for the well being of each
individual. These values are currently being denied to the Palestinian
population. We count on the GCMHP to continue with all its efforts and
expertise, to contribute to the development of these important universal
values."
</p><p>Concerning the agreement, Mr. Afana said that the most important item in
the agreement is the assistance GCMHP would receive to upgrade its
personnel and administrative systems in preparation to establishing a
regional institute of community mental health and human rights in Gaza.
The institute would attract students and teachers from the whole region.
GCMHP's unique experience in the field of training and education will
enable it to supervise the institute. In this regard, the Programme has
been implementing the postgraduate diploma in community mental health
and human rights since 1997.

</p><p>The diploma is a 2-year course with the first one for theoretical study
and the second for practical clinical and community training.  Trainees
are exposed to the basis of psychiatry, psychology, and counseling
through a culturally sensitive curriculum adapted to Palestinian culture
and society. Students are educated to attain a better understanding of
mental health and human rights in Palestine in order to work towards
resolving psychosocial problems while utilizing cultural components such
as the family. This understanding is applicable to similar Arab
societies.

</p><p>The topics taught to students include: clinical psychiatry, health
education, field work, cognitive therapy, scientific research, child
development, culture and mental health, human rights, and democracy.

</p><p>Upon graduation, students receive accredited diplomas from the Islamic
University and the Palestinian Ministry of Education."

</p><p>In addition to the diploma, the Programme conducts training courses to
professionals in Palestinian governmental and non-governmental
organizations, including physicians, nurses, psychologists, social
workers, security personnel, teachers, and counselors.

</p><p>At the end of the signing ceremony, Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj thanked Mr. Ron
Muyzert on behalf of the Programme. He also extended his thanks to the
people and government of the Netherlands.
