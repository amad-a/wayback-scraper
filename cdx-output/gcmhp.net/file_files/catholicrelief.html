Palestinian people and the difficulties they face as a result of the
military occupation and economic hardships, and their effects on the
mental health of the population, especially children. In addition, Mr.
Afana and Mr. El-Nounou informed the guests of the Program's pressing
needs, such as training teachers, student counselors, and parents on how
to deal with the psychological and behavioral problems of children in
