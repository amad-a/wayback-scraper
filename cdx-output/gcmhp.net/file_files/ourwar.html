<br><div align="center"><b>by Nancy Murray</b></div>

   <p> Standing on a roof in the West Bank town of Beit Jala which borders 
Bethlehem, I observed for several hours the latest communications between 
Israel and the Palestinians.  On one side were Palestinians in olive groves 
firing rifles in the direction of the Israeli settlement of Gilo, their 
bullets mostly falling short of their target.  On the other side, the Israeli 
Defense Force was responding with helicopter-launched guided missiles, a 
barrage of machine gun fire and exploding tank shells.  Before the morning of 
November 16, this unequal exchange had claimed the life of a German doctor, 
Harry Fischer, who had ventured out on the street to help an injured neighbor 
and been struck by an Israeli shell.  For two hours his badly mutilated body 
lay on the road.  The German ambassador and representatives of the Red Cross 
were unable to get the Israelis to agree to a cease-fire so it could be 
retrieved.
    </p><p>In the morning, the international press visited the shrine erected on the 
spot where Dr. Fischer died.  It briefly seemed that the death of a German 
doctor might put what UN Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson has called 
Israel's "excessive and disproportionate use of force" back on the front 
pages, reinforcing the urgent Palestinian call for international protection.
    </p><p>But by late November, with the number of Palestinians killed during two 
months of clashes reaching 260, a third of them children, news of the deaths 
had become routine in the two countries that could stop them - Israel and the 
USA.  For the Israeli public "four Palestinians killed is an ordinary 
occurrence," wrote award-winning Israeli journalist Amira Haas.  "Nobody asks 
if it is logical that an unarmed 15-year-old was hit in the head by the 
precise bullet of a trained sniper" (Ha'aretz, November 15).
    </p><p>Israeli sharpshooters using silencers target Palestinian demonstrators 
aged 12 and up.  "So why kill, why not just injure?"  Amira Haas asked an 
Israeli army sharpshooter in an interview published in the widely-read 
Ha'aretz (November 20).   "If you decide to wound people, more people will 
get hurt, and the question is whether this is better.  Wounding fans anger 
even more," was the response.
    </p><p>In early November the Physicians for Human Rights reported that 33 
Palestinian ambulances had been hit by Israeli gunfire, with 17 completely 
destroyed.  The New-York based Committee to Protect Journalists documented 
the cases of ten journalists wounded by Israeli bullets during the same 
period of time.  Israelis I talked to who considered themselves part of the 
peace movement found it hard to come to terms with these facts.
    </p><p>For its part, the mainstream US media rarely questions the Israeli 
assertion that the use of high-powered weapons, attack helicopters, missiles, 
tanks, gunboats, house demolitions, "sweeps" that clear the ground of 
Palestinian-owned buildings and olive groves, blockades, and an economic 
siege against a largely unarmed population constitutes "restraint."  Few 
Americans know why Palestinians have given up on what many in the US still 
assume was a genuine "peace process," and how deeply implicated this country 
is in its failure.
    </p><p>Had the US truly been an "honest broker" of the Oslo process, Israel 
would not have been able to use the last seven years to establish the sort of 
"facts on the ground" that virtually rule out the creation of a viable 
Palestinian state.  For a brief moment in 1991, President Bush used Israel's 
request for $10 billion in loan guarantees to demand a settlement freeze.  
But the standoff was short-lived, and Israel eventually received practically 
all of the loan guarantees in addition to its $3 billion plus in annual US 
aid.  Meanwhile, throughout the '90s it steadily confiscated Palestinian 
land, doubled the number of settlers to 370,000, and created a network of 
"Jewish only" by pass roads in the West Bank that turned areas of Palestinian 
autonomy into isolated islands. 
    </p><p>Today, large numbers of US citizens are amassed on both sides of the 
barricades.  American-born settlers, estimated at 15 percent of the total 
settler population in the early 1990s, have taken up residence throughout the 
West Bank and Gaza, claiming Palestinian territory as "theirs".  Americans 
should not be proud of their settler exports.  One of them, Rabbi Moshe 
Levinger, has for years made the lives of his Hebron neighbors miserable.  He 
was lionized by his followers for his ten weeks spent in prison in 1990 for 
the unprovoked killing of a Palestinian merchant.  Brooklyn-born Baruch 
Goldstein, who remains a hero to many religious settlers, gunned down thirty 
Palestinians during Ramadan prayers in Hebron's Ibrahim Mosque in February 
1994.  Six years earlier, during the first Palestinian intifada, Goldstein 
told Ellen Hosmer, editor-at-large for Multinational Monitor:
    </p><p>"This land belongs to us, and the Arabs don't belong to us, so the land 
we should keep.  The Arabs we should let go.  I think it's feasible to do so. 
  <br>Militarily it's no problem...Will the world accept us driving them out?  
Eventually we're going to have to drive them out or we'll be driven out.  
Either one or the other."
    <br>Today, Israeli settlers are being "protected" by American-made armored 
jeeps, armaments, missiles and helicopters, purchased with my tax dollars and 
used against Palestinians, some of whom, like my formerly stateless Beit Jala 
host and thousands of other residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, hold 
US citizenship.  The US, mute before Israel's repeated violations of 
international law governing the actions of an occupier, will only agree to a 
UN protection force if it is called for by Israel.  Meanwhile, President 
Clinton in mid-November asked Congress for another $450 million in military 
aid to Israel.
    </p><p>How can the United States be moved to adopt a more "even-handed" policy 
in the region?  I returned from the West Bank and Gaza Strip with two 
thoughts - one pure fantasy, the other fast becoming a reality.
    </p><p>As I entered the 22-mile-long prison that is the Gaza Strip, home to 1.2 
million Palestinians caged in by an electrified fence and military 
checkpoints, I wished for the company of those US politicians, opinion-makers 
and censors who had over the decades done so much to silence and distort the 
Palestinian side of the story.
    </p><p>What would they think of the suffocating conditions of total closure, of 
the strangled economy, of the dwindling food, fuel and medical supplies, of 
ambulances carrying the seriously injured being held up indefinitely at 
checkpoints?  What would they say to the boy in the "USA" T-shirt, who stood 
with his family in the ruins of their house in Rafah that had just been 
bulldozed by Israeli soldiers who still control the area between the Gaza 
Strip and Egypt, and spend their days firing live ammunition at children who 
hurl rocks into the no-man's land?  How would they regard the few thousand 
settlers who control 30 percent of the Gaza Strip, have their own roads to 
travel on and keep their swimming pools full and sprinklers working while 
700,000 Palestinians are crammed into refugee camps and drink water 
contaminated with salt.  What would they make of our visit to Nasser Hospital 
in Khan Yunis, where we talked to children from the village of Deir al-Balah 
wounded in their homes by gunfire from the nearby heavily-fortified 
settlement of Kfar Darom?  How would they react to the Kfar Darom settlers 
and soldiers who blocked the main north-south artery in the Gaza Strip with 
tanks and played soccer in the road as Palestinians fumed in their overheated 
cars and buses?
    </p><p>If those behind America's uncritical support of Israel are unlikely to 
put themselves in a position where they are obliged to face up to what seven 
years of Oslo have meant for Palestinians, the Qatar-based television station 
Al-Jazeera is making sure that the Arab "street" will be fully informed.  The 
detailed coverage which this internationally-acclaimed CNN-style station is 
giving to the Israeli repression of the Al-Aqsa intifada is reaching into 
households around the region, inflaming sentiment against the United States.  
If regional stability is a prime concern for US policy-makers, they have 
plenty to worry about now.
    </p><p>So do the Israelis.   Sooner or later they are going to have to face the 
facts and deal with the consequences of their "Greater Israel" land grab: 
they cannot have their settlements and peace too.  As Israeli peace activist 
Uri Avnery wrote in his November 25th letter to the settlers:
    <br>"Every settlement is a land mine on the road to peace.  You are sitting 
on the land reserves of the Palestinian people, on stolen land, and use the 
water needed by another people for their very existence.    You dominate the 
landscape; symbols of the occupation...What you and the soldiers are doing 
now is creating such rage and hatred among the Palestinians, that your 
continued presence in the territories has become impossible.  Every dead 
child, every demolished home, every 'blockade' and 'liquidation' brings the 
end of your settlements nearer."
    </p><p>It is not strictly necessary for US legislators to stand on a roof near 
Bethlehem to comprehend the truth of this message - but it might help.
