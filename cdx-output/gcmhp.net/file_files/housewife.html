 <p>On 28 February 2001, Nada Abdel Jabbar, a 45-year old housewife with 8 
 children from the village of Beit Fourik fell while working at home and 
 started to bleed severely. Her family called an ambulance; but Israeli 
 soldiers at the checkpoint prevented it from entering the village. So, 
 Nada had to be transferred to the checkpoint in a private car. Her 
 family approached the soldiers in order to get permission to carry her 
 by foot to the ambulance waiting on the other side. Despite Nada's 
 critical condition, the soldiers refused to let her and her family 
 pass-not even on foot. 

 </p><p>Her family was then forced to take a dirt back road through the 
 neighboring village of Salem. Again they were stopped by Israeli 
 soldiers and denied access into Nablus where the main hospital is. 

 </p><p>In a third attempt, the family took yet another dirt road and finally 
 managed to reach the hospital after 45 minutes. Without the Israeli 
 imposed siege, the trip from Beit Fourik to Nablus takes about 10 
 minutes. By the time Nada reached the hospital, she had already lost a 
 lot of blood. Despite all efforts to save her life, she died two hours 
 later. 

 </p><p>This is yet another crime committed by the Israeli army against civilian 
 Palestinians. Nada and her family were not terrorists and did not pose 
 any security threat to Israel. They were trying to go to a Palestinian 
 town for medical treatment. 

 </p><p>We call upon all the advocates of human rights and all those that value 
 human life to call upon the Israeli government to respect international 
 law and the provisions of the 4th Geneva convention regarding civilian 
 population in war zones.
