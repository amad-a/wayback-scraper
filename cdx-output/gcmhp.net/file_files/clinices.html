<p><br><br>At its founding, GCMHP represented an important new effort to address
the pressing mental health needs of a society rocked by violence,
upheaval, and uncertainty.
</p><p> Mental health services in the Gaza Strip were
extremely scarce at a time when the need for such services was perhaps
at its highest.
 </p><p><b>The Mental Health Services Department (MHSD)</b>, which over
time has come to incorporate more and more clinical services, aims to
improve the state of mental health in the Palestinian community,
particularly among the most vulnerable sectors.
 Even as the scope of the
Programme has expanded, clinical work still remains at the heart of
GCMHP's sustained efforts to heal the wounds of violence and suffering.

</p><p>The Mental Health Services Department represents a comprehensive system
with standard procedures and a community-based approach to mental health
services appropriate to the needs and demands of Palestinian society.

Treatment plans routinely involve the family, and patients are often
visited in their homes, to ensure a supportive and relaxed environment
and to emphasize the communal aspects of mental health therapy.
 From its
inception as a single clinic with three staff members, GCMHP has
expanded to include three clinics, one community day treatment program
<b>(CDTP)</b>, an occupational therapy unit, an Electro-Encephalo-Graphy unit
<b>(EEG)</b>, a pharmacy, and a physiotherapy unit.


</p><p><b>Clinics:</b>

</p><p>The Mental Health Services Department operates four clinics distributed
throughout the Gaza Strip. The more recent of these was opened in 1999
in the town of Deir al-Balah, serving the middle of the Strip, which
previously lacked a specialized mental health facility.
 GCMHP's other
clinics are located in <b>Gaza City</b>,<b> Jabalia</b>, and <b>Khan Younis</b>.

</p><p>Over the past several years, the clinical staff has become increasingly
specialized through advanced training and experience.
 With a multi-disciplinary team in each clinic, GCMHP has adopted a specialized
case management process comprised of identification, coordination, and
monitoring of patient services. This diversification has allowed for
specialized handling of cases for women, children, and victims of human
rights violations.
 Upon receiving a referral, a member of the team
conducts a comprehensive clinical interview in order to begin
assessment. If necessary, home, school, or work visits are conducted to
complete the evaluation. Then a team discussion is conducted, during
which the team makes a diagnosis and creates treatment plans.
 At that point, a case manager takes responsibility for the case, providing
treatment, conducting follow-ups, making home visits, and carrying out
evaluations.

</p><p>With a combination of psychological, family, and community
interventions, the GCMHP clinical team attempts to provide a supportive
environment in which healing can take place. While performing classical
psychological work, GCMHP firmly roots its therapy in a culturally
sensitive, community based approach, adapting Western approaches to the
needs of Palestinian society.

</p><p><b>Community Day Treatment Program (CDTP)</b>

GCMHP is currently working to upgrade the Deir al-Balah clinic to a day
treatment facility, serving the middle zone of the Gaza Strip.
The major components of this new treatment program are:
</p><ul>
<li>Crisis intervention services</li>
<li>Treatment and rehabilitation</li>
<li>Out reach and care management for patients and family</li>
<li>Public meetings and public awareness campaigns about mental health</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Occupational Therapy Unit</b>

</p><p>The Occupational Therapy <b>(OT)</b> Unit was established in 1991 at our
Jabalia clinic. Occupational Therapy enables individuals to function as
independently as possible in their daily life activities and working
environment. During the OT sessions, clients develop disrupted skills
through various therapeutic activities like painting, drawing, wood
activities, and carpet weaving.

</p><p><b>EEG Unit (Electo-Encephalo-Graphy)</b>

</p><p>The EEG Unit was established in 1991 in the Gaza City clinic to serve
all the population in the Strip. Twenty percent of cases at the Gaza
clinic receive EEG services free of charge and the remainder (80%) paid
cost price only for the diagnostic tests.

</p><p><b>Pharmacy:
</b>
</p><p>Although GCMHP does not follow a medical-oriented approach, psychotropic
drugs are proscribed to some clients, particularly chronic cases and
patients requiring medication for a short period of time in the initial
phase of therapy. To ensure that clients receive appropriate medication
at an affordable price, each clinic has a pharmacy. Because of economic
hardship, approximately 60% of clients receive medication free of
charge. The remaining 40% pay the cost price only for medication.

</p><p><b>Physiotherapy Unit:
</b>
</p><p>The Physiotherapy Unit was established in March 1998 at the Gaza clinic
to provide services for GCMHP clients, especially victims of human
rights violations. The main goal of physiotherapy is to enable the
individual to overcome his psychomotor dysfunction so that he can be
reintegrated into the community.

</p><p><b>Information Systems:
</b>
</p><p>Clinical data is preserved in a computerized database. In June 1999, a
special committee composed of the Medical Director, Medical Secretary,
and a computer software expert startd working to upgrade the database
management program in order to solve several problems experienced in
several areas that include outcome, diagnosis, case management, and age.
The new program started functioning in March 2000. Currently, a trained
medical secretary who is supervised by a qualified computer programmer
maintains the database. The database is highly confidential and access
to the information is given only to qualified personnel.</p><p><br><br>
