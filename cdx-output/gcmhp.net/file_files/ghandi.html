<p>My sympathies are all with the Jews. I have known them intimately in South 
Africa. Some of them became life-long companions. Through these friends I 
came to learn much of their age-long persecution. They have been the 
untouchables of Christianity. The parallel between their treatment by 
Christians and the treatment of untouchables by Hindus is very close. 
Religious sanction has been invoked in both cases for the justification of 
the inhuman treatment meted out to them. Apart from the friendships, 
therefore, there is the more common universal reason for my sympathy for the 
Jews. 

</p><p>But my sympathy does not blind me to the requirements of justice. The cry 
for the national home for the Jews does not make much appeal to me. The 
sanction for it is sought in the Bible and the tenacity with which the Jews 
have hankered after return to Palestine. Why should they not, like other 
peoples of the earth, make that country their home where they are born and 
where they earn their livelihood? 

</p><p>Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the 
English or France to the French. It is wrong and in-human to impose the Jews 
on the Arabs. What is going on in Palestine today cannot be justified by any 
moral code of conduct. The mandates have no sanction but that of the last 
war. Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs 
so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their 
national home. 

</p><p>The nobler course would be to insist on a just treatment of the Jews 
wherever they are born and bred. The Jews born in France are French in 
precisely the same sense that Christians born in France are French. If the 
Jews have no home but Palestine, will they relish the idea of being forced 
to leave the other parts of the world in which they are settled? Or do they 
want a double home where they can remain at will? This cry for the national 
home affords a colourable justification for the German expulsion of the 
Jews. 

</p><p>I am not defending the Arab excesses. I wish they had chosen the way of 
non-violence in resisting what they rightly regarded as an unwarrantable 
encroachment upon their country. But according to the accepted canons of 
right and wrong, nothing can be said against the Arab resistance in the face 
of overwhelming odds. 

</p><p>Let the Jews who claim to be the chosen race prove their title by choosing 
the way of non-violence for vindicating their position on earth. Every 
country is their home including Palestine not by aggre-ssion but by loving 
service. A Jewish friend has sent me a book called The Jewish Contribution 
to Civilization by Cecil Roth. It gives a record of what the Jews have done 
to enrich the world’s literature, art, music, drama, science, medicine, 
agriculture, etc. Given the will, the Jew can refuse to be treated as the 
outcaste of the West, to be despised or patronized. He can command the 
attention and respect of the world by being man, the chosen creation of God, 
instead of being man who is fast sinking to the brute and forsaken by God. 
They can add to their many contributions the surpassing contribution of 
non-violent action.
