<p></p><div align="center"><b><font size="+1">Appeal for an international Protection force</font></b></div>

<p>We the undersigned, Palestinian and Israeli intellectuals and activists, view with grave concern the unbearable and inhuman situation imposed on the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza.  Such a situation has been brought about by the repression, blockades, and daily humiliation exercised by the military occupation and by daily harassment of hundreds of thousands of settlers. We cannot remain unmoved while the suffering of Palestinians and the violation of their human and political rights continues undeterred. The recent seizure of Palestinian institutions (including Orient House) in Jerusalem and environs can only exacerbate the situation and lead to more bloodshed and suffering of innocent people.  We feel it is our duty to support the call for the immediate provision of an international force to protect the Palestinian people in its struggle for the exercise of its right to self-determination and freedom, and to put an end to the military occupation of its land.

</p><p>We urge all those concerned, everywhere, to join us in voicing their strong opposition to the continued occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, and to support our call for the provision of effective international protection for Palestinians from the aggression and repression of the Israeli occupation. Such an international force, we believe, would greatly facilitate the resumption of serious and meaningful negotiations between Palestinian and Israeli leaders and the settlement of the conflict on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions and a two states solution.
