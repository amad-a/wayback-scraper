<p><b><font size="+1">Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states:</font></b>

</p><p>"Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property
belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the
State, or to other public authorities, or to social or cooperative
organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered
absolutely necessary by military operations."

</p><p><b><font size="+1">Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states:</font></b>

</p><p>"No protected person [ie those living under foreign occupation] may be
punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed.
Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation...are
prohibited...Reprisals against protected persons and their property are
prohibited"

</p><p>Shortly after midnight on 2 May, IDF tanks and bulldozers forced their
way into the Brazil Refugee camp near Rafah, in the Gaza Strip.
Residents and their supporters tried to protect their homes, and in the
gun-battles that resulted one man was killed and approximately twelve
others, including several children, were wounded. The IDF destroyed 19
homes, leaving 149 people from 25 families homeless. They gave no
warning, and the residents had no time to remove their possessions.

</p><p>In the past month Israel has intensified its policy of destroying
Palestinian homes, apparently as a collective punishment for attacks on
Israeli forces. Hundreds of people have been made homeless and had their
possessions destroyed. The demolitions are set to continue.

</p><p>The Israeli authorities have been destroying Palestinian homes and
making families homeless as a punishment for attacks committed by family
members on Israelis. In recent months they have continued this policy,
but they are now destroying Palestinian homes apparently as collective
punishment after attacks on Israel by Palestinian armed groups. They are
now also demolishing buildings inside the area under the control of the
Palestinian Authority, as well as the territory which remains under
direct Israeli control.

</p><p>The circumstances of these demolitions of homes suggest that Israeli
forces have acted in order to punish Palestinian civilians and not in
the course of conducting "absolutely necessary" military operations. As
such, these measures would constitute a form of collective punishment
against the civilian population and a violation of international
humanitarian law.

</p><p>I urge you to lobby the Israeli authorities to cease demolition of
houses in contravention of international humanitarian law, and to
provide fair and adequate compensation to those whose homes have been
destroyed or damaged.

</p><p><b>Sincerely yours,</b>

</p><p><b>Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj</b>
<br><b>Director General</b>
