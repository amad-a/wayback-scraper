<p></p><div align="center"><b>By Edward W. Said
Dawn - February 8, 2001</b></div>


<p>THE story is told of the celebrated writer,  Guy  de  Maupassant, who shortly after the Eiffel Tower was  built  in  mid-nineteenth century Paris, would go around  the  city  complaining  endlessly about how much he disliked the great structure. And yet, he would nevertheless unfailingly go to the Tower's restaurant  for  lunch every single day. When his attention was drawn to the paradox  in his behaviour, Maupassant coolly answered, "I  go  there  because being inside it is the  only  place  in  Paris  where  you  don't actually have to look at or even see the Tower."
 
</p><p>My general impression is that for most Israelis, their country is invisible. Being in it means a certain blindness or inability  to see what it is and what has been happening to  it,  and  just  as remarkably, an unwillingness to understand what it has meant  for others in the world and specially in the Middle East. By the time these lines will appear in print, the Israeli elections will have taken place and, perhaps, as has been supposed for several  weeks now, Ariel Sharon will have become prime minister.

</p><p>Just as happened in the months before and immediately after  Ehud Barak's elections, a great deal of US media  attention  has  been focused on Sharon in attempts to make him seem like a  plausible, or at least not so bizarre and outrageous a candidate. I  do  not think that anyone outside Israel is really convinced, but  it  is stunningly odd that a majority of Israelis would consider turning to the unregenerate old killer of Palestinians after four  months under Ehud Barak of  uselessly  spilling  Palestinian  blood  and collectively punishing several million Arab residents of the West Bank, Gaza, and  Israel  proper,  without  anything  having  been achieved.

</p><p>According to the polls, Israelis have opted for a  man  who  will bring them more rather than less  violence,  which,  it  must  be added at once, makes  Israel's  own  future  relations  with  the Palestinians, the Arab states and  the  Muslim  world  even  less likely to be peaceful and less free of difficulty.  The  question is how people could contemplate so obviously counter-productive a choice unless they simply had no idea what the world  thought  of them to begin with,  no  idea  that  such  destruction  and  such cruelty will earn further  alienation  and  dislike,  and  hence, insecurity.

</p><p>Flirting with Sharon now is therefore a turning further  inwards, a resolute dismissal of the outside world in favour  of  the  old and thoroughly discredited policy of bashing Arabs that has  made Israel a more and more isolated and discredited country  than  it has ever been. Of course, life goes on within it just as it  does everywhere else, and in all sorts of ways, it should  be  obvious that most Israelis are normal people  who  want  to  live  normal lives, bring up their families, prosper in their work, and  carry on without fear of catastrophe or war. Yet, as  a  people,  their collective history has been very much an unwelcome part of modern Arab history and,  for  Palestinians  in  particular,  an  almost unmitigated disaster.

</p><p>And, so it has gone for over fifty years, life in  one  community has meant frustration and suffering in  the  other,  measure  for measure,  tit  for  tat,   inexorably   and   remorselessly.   No Palestinian needs reminding that every Israeli triumph has been a
symmetrical Palestinian loss.
 
</p><p>Even after 1967,  when  Israelis  and  Palestinians  were  thrown together demographically more than ever before, the distance  and difference between the two worlds deepened and widened  in  spite of the total proximity between them.  Military  occupation  never made for understanding, and so the post-Oslo years  provided  for little  mutuality,  except  where  the   relatively   small   and privileged group of security  people  and  the  negotiators  were concerned.

</p><p>Rather than trying to connect  the  Israeli  policy  of  military occupation with the intifada as cause and effect,  many  Israelis now seem to want Sharon to "deal with  the  Arabs,"  as  if  "the Arabs" were so many flies or a swarm of annoying bees.What  seems never to have occurred even to Israeli  peaceniks  was  that  the incredibly slow and tortured pace  of  Israeli  steps  in  ceding territory here and there, plus the thousands  of  conditions  and the  many,  many  hours  that  went  into  negotiating  all   the unimaginably complicated conditions that Israel attached to every little step it took such as moving some troops from one  side  of the West Bank to the other, plus the  constant  building  of  new settlements, plus the new subdivisions and roads that cut up Gaza and the West Bank more and more, plus the frequent closures,  the continued use of torture, the settler  violence  in  places  like Hebron, plus the fact that under Barak no territory  at  all  was given up, as if all this which made matters  worse,  not  better, was something that the pro-peace camp in Israel had not  absorbed or understood.
 
</p><p>Even though it must be said that Palestinians have behaved as all colonized people in history have behaved towards  the  colonizer: they rebelled in protest. What is so difficult or  obscure  about that, and why do so  evidently  well  endowed  a  people  as  the Israelis resist understanding  the  most  elementary  aspects  of human behaviour?

</p><p>But, consider that if one allows for  a  moment  that  all  those things being done to Palestinians as part of a peace process were supposed to be making things better, - yes,  better  -  then  one must have the strangest possible sense of oneself,  the  weirdest imaginable psychology. What does this inverted sense of cause and effect reveal about the person? What does it suggest  to  believe that punishment and sadism will  actually  improve  relationships between people?

</p><p>This is pure punitive sadism: it serves no security or long-range purpose except to make life a hell for all Palestinians who spend most of their time on the roads in the  normal  course  of  their lives, enduring endless delays, detours, searches,  humiliations, interrogations and, much of the  time,  failing  to  reach  their destinations just  because  of  Israeli  caprice.  How  can  that possibly help anyone, and  how  can  anyone,  except  someone  so hopelessly out of touch with reality believe otherwise?
 
</p><p>I can quite easily imagine that Israelis who were  in  favour  of such procedures were, when it came to all other aspects of  life, quite like other people. It was only when and  where  Arabs  were concerned that things were believed to be different. Not once, to my knowledge, did an Israeli leader stop and  say,  for  example, 'we have wronged these people, we have driven them out  of  their homes, we have destroyed their society and dispossessed them, let us at least remember that and try to make things easier for  them now'. Never during the long and tortuous negotiating sessions  of the peace process was it so much as whispered to the  press  that an  Israeli  official  had  said  something  magnanimous  or  had intimated that he felt some twinge of  conscience  for  what  had been done in the name of Israel to an entire people.

</p><p>All we heard was that every inch of land that was  discussed  was released to Palestinians with thousands of  conditions  attached, that an already divided Palestine was subdivided three, four, and more times in order to keep it just out of Palestinian reach, and so that Palestinians would have more hurdles  to  jump  over  and more years to wait before they could reach anything like a viable state of autonomy. And still hundreds of political prisoners were kept in their cells, and still Israel's Palestinian citizens were kept in their impoverished villages, their  sub-standard  schools and municipalities, unable to buy or lease land for religious and ethnic reasons just  so  that  Israel  could  maintain  a  Jewish majority in lordly style, so that Israeli Jews  could  bully  and oppress another people without having to think about them or even see too much of them.

</p><p>You don't have to have the gifts either of Aristotle or de Gaulle to realize that Israel's policy of official blindness  was  never going to bring victory, any more than Sharon's policy in  Lebanon was a success, or Barak's "peace" policy was going to bring peace or end the Aqsa intifada. Like de Maupassant in the Eiffel  Tower restaurant, an Israel led by a hawkish general  is  going  deeper and deeper into a place from which it can neither escape nor  winthe battle. Far from really withdrawing into itself, it is making certain on the contrary that it will remain connected to the Arab world in the worst way via its army,  settlers,  conquerors,  and ranting ideologues, while its citizens, its artists, its ordinary people are paralyzed by visions of escape and a clean slate  that have no more chance of realization now than they ever did.
 
</p><p>Fanciful ideas of Israeli power today as embodied in  the  people who like Sharon are at best a postponement, and a bloody  one  at that, of the inevitable realization that apartheid can only  work if two peoples accept the notion of separation  with  inferiority that the strong imposes on the weak. But since that  is  not  the case (and has never happened  in  history),  it  will  always  be unlikely that people will cheerfully  accept  their  enslavement. Why are Israelis en masse fooling themselves into  thinking  that it will work in so small an area and so historically saturated  a geography as Palestine's?

</p><p>It is difficult to believe that so long as they  believe  in  the miracle  of   an   Israel   miraculously   separated   from   its circumstances and environment - a bizarre notion  which  Sharon's election campaign has encouraged - Israeli Jews resemble  members of a cult rather than citizens of a modern secular state. And, in some ways, it is true that Israel's early history as a pioneering new state is that of a utopian cult, sustained by people much  of whose energy was in shutting out their  surroundings  while  they lived the fantasy of a heroic and pure enterprise.
