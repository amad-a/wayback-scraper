<p>Over the past few days, the Israeli army escalated its aggression against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Sadly, these measures are typical Israeli, indiscriminate, collective punishment against civilian population to which we have become accustomed. However, the latest measure are characterized by unprecedented severity both in their effect Palestinian's lives, and in their disregard for the most basic human rights. 

</p><p>Since Monday, the Israeli army has imposed a strict siege on the Gaza Strip and closed all points of entry or exit from the Strip. Moreover, it has divided the Strip into 4 separate areas. Citizens, basic goods, and medical supplies are prevented from entering the Gaza Strip or moving between these areas. In addition, the army has taken severe measures against civilians as exemplified by shooting a 52-year old farmer in his grove. The effects of this siege and separation have paralyzed daily life in the Gaza Strip. 

</p><p>At GCMHP, we have felt the effects of these inhumane measures. Our clinics in Gaza, Jabalia, Deir El-Balah, and Khan Younis have been cut off, and staff members working in those clinics but living in different areas have not been able to reach them. In addition, patients in areas that have been sealed off are denied access to the clinics. 

</p><p>Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj, the Chairman of the Board, is unable to come back to Palestine. Dr. Ahmad Abu Tawahina, the Executive Director, is unable to come to the Programme Headquarter in Gaza, as he is a resident of Deir El-Balah. The pharmacist in our Gaza clinic is prevented from reaching the clinic, as he is a resident of Nuseirat refugee camp. A number of secretaries as well as the nanny in the Programme’s nursery have been unable to report 
to work for several days due to the forced separation. 

</p><p>Our training activities have also been hindered. Many of the students and trainers of the post-graduate diploma in community mental health and human rights live in areas that are separated from Gaza City. They are unable to conduct their schedule of lectures, practical training, and supervision. Also, the research department is paralyzed since the secretary and field workers cannot report to work. Moreover, the Women’s Empowerment branches in Deir El-Balah and Rafah are cut off from the 
main center in Gaza City. 

</p><p>The patients are not responsible for the bombings in Israel and neither are the professionals at GCMHP or other organizations. If Israel puts the whole population responsible for the acts of individuals it is unable to apprehend, then the whole Israeli society is responsible for the massacres its army is committing in Gaza and the West Bank. It is a sick logic that Israel feels free to use, while blaming others when they do likewise. 

</p><p><b>We call upon all the voices of humanity to call upon the Israeli government and diplomatic missions worldwide to stop its flagrant violations of human rights.
