<p>A few weeks ago I went to an Arab capital for a family matter. For ten days I sensed the fear and oppression. People are terrified islands, remote and unreal. They follow the news of the Palestinian Intifada, and express their condemnation of the helpless Arab regimes. But when it comes to their regime, they go mute. 

</p><p>Some dare to whisper, only the brave can. They whisper about the corruption of the ruling family, and how it swallows the national income, commissions and forced partnerships. They whisper about arms deals and private airports, about discos and bars inside palaces, about fur and gold, about rape of women and  men. 

</p><p>As the place was devoid of natural beauty, art or culture, it made me wonder how people make a meaning of their life, and what it take to make it bearable without music or trees. 
For locals, it was apparently over indulgence in purchasing goods of luxury, in sex and drugs, or praying for solace and redemption. 

</p><p>For the foreign worker, it was the survival. Away from Egypt, Jordan or India, the need to send money to the family back home was the only objective. Some go there to make a kill. 

 </p><p>For Palestinians, it was the Television news, the struggle and the Intifada. Politically divided, as ever, they do not stop arguing about Arafat shortcomings and achievements, the Palestinian Authority, the future leadership, Arab hospitality and impotence, global conspiracy and the American elections.  They are only united in agony over the eternal question; when can we go back home? 

</p><p>Going back home was blocked this time for me. Israel has sealed off the Gaza strip and the West Bank.  No Palestinian was allowed in or out. I was therefore tempted to go on a trip I always wanted to make a Nile cruise to Luxur and Aswan. 

</p><p>It was my first real holiday in the last ten years. Four days of serenity, in the company of beauty, culture and the many trees along the Nile, watched over by Ramses and looked after by his giant descendents, the most hospitable and charming people. 

 </p><p>Then, home was allowed. With mixed feelings of joy and apprehension, I crossed the borders at Rafah, helped by compatriots who endure working under Israeli superiority. 
Driving through the tortuous roads from Rafah to Gaza was traumatic and shocking, not because of the Israeli aggressive tanks or its soldiers. Worse was the scene of severed trees that for decades were the beauty along the lonely road. This is a very sad army, I thought, when a tree or a child becomes military target. 

</p><p>And how many trees, and children will have to die before they discover humanity, so we begin to enjoy this fleeting moment, called life?
