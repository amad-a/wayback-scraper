<p>She insisted on accompanying him to the barber saying, "I want to remember all the details of this day. Please don't deprive me of this wish."

</p><p>The couple spent the hours going from the barber to the tailor, florist, sweets shop, and other places. By evening, she sat exhausted, but very happy. Suddenly, she said as if talking to herself, "of all the things I saw today, I cannot imagine how you men put your head in the hands of a razor-wielding man who runs his blade on your necks. You men are strange."

</p><p>As he looked at her, his eyes conveyed all his love, and his lips were parted into a lazy smile. He didn't comment and let her continue.

</p><p>"You men do a lot of barbaric things. You start wars and spread destruction. Then you submit like a small child and give your necks to the barber's blade."

</p><p>His gaze turned into a surprised one as she continued saying, "Look at the destruction and carnage of one day in the US. It was like an earthquake or a curse from the sky. No one could have imagined such a well-planned, well-executed operation. After it happened, world leaders come out one after another calling for restraint and calm. These are the same leaders that have started and fought wars. Some of them even used terrorism. Suddenly, they have become peace advocates. But I think that it is too late. The knife has struck."

</p><p>He sat upright and asked, "Do you think that the US will go to war?"

</p><p>She answered in a decisive tone, "What controls the US are local politics, internal issues, and the politicians' desire to be re-elected. This means that they have to answer the war-drums pounding all over that country. The US must conduct a military operation to redeem Americans' faith in their system."

</p><p>He asked anxiously, "Don't you think that there will be some good after all this evil?"

</p><p>She laughed, then replied, "If women ruled our world, all this evil would not have happened….." 

</p><p>He interrupted her, "Then you are saying that war is coming and that there is nothing to indicate otherwise?"

</p><p>"Yes. It is because I doubt that the men who are decision-makers have a long-term vision that will restore stability to the world and make justice, peace, and democracy.  They filled the last century with hollow while they practiced the opposite of their preaching. These leaders were waging wars against helpless nations, using torture, polluting the environment, and violating human rights. They were doing all of these things while moving from palace to palace on private jets and yachts. Let me tell you frankly that I don't think that the massacre in the US or others like it will change the way these leaders think. Otherwise, it will be a miracle. 

</p><p>He replied calmly, "I think that you are biased towards women and against men. This makes your judgment flawed. It is known throughout history that great decisions and visions were born out of pain and catastrophes. I think that what happened in the US will lead to new horizons. This is true, especially because Europe feels the heat due to its proximity to the Middle East, and because of the Arab and Islamic groups in Europe and the US."

</p><p>With clear irritation, she asked, "Can you tell me why there such a focus on Osama Bin Laden, Islam, and Arabs when the investigation is still in its early stages? Tell me how American investigators can charge Bin Laden in 24 hours when they still don't know who killed President Kennedy after 24 years? It is a large conspiracy to control our lives and riches. You will see how Israel will use this situation to its advantage with more killings and destruction under the pretext of fighting terrorism and defending the civilization that Barak boasts to belong to!"

</p><p>He answered, "Let me tell you that all of what you say is possible. But there is also the possibility that the massacre will awaken many who thought that the US is an unbeatable power. They will begin to understand that the US must deal with the world, and especially the Palestinian question, differently. Otherwise, it will experience pain and loss."

</p><p>She asked, "Why the Palestinian question in particular?"

</p><p>He replied, "Because all attempts to understand what happens in the Middle East over the past 50 years tell us that the Palestinian question and the establishment of Israel were the reason behind the coups and revolutions in the Arab world and even Iran. The same reasons are behind the wars of 48, 56, 67, 73, Black September in Jordan, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the Gulf war, and the two intifadas. We must find a just solution to this problem that ensures freedom to the Palestinians and dignity to Arabs and Muslims because this problem is the cause of their anger. 

</p><p>She replied sarcastically, "Then we have to wait for the bounties of the American and Israeli justice for this just solution to come down to us from the sky."

</p><p>He replied firmly, "No! We have to grab the opportunity. Let me tell you that the last Palestinian initiative in which the leadership declared a cease-fire and said that it was ready to fight terrorism and enter peace negotiations is a sign of Palestinian genius, which is trying to put clear the Palestinian goal of peace."

</p><p>Quickly, she said, "And let me tell you that I wished that this initiative made it clear that peace will not be achieved unless an end is put to the occupation, settlements dismantled, and Palestinians attain their rights."

</p><p>He said, "The Palestinian initiative will put Israel, Europe, and the US in a position in which they have to interact with it. Otherwise, they know that we have the ability to resist for a long time."

</p><p>She asked, "Do you have faith in Sharon to respond to such an initiative seriously? Don't you know that Sharon still dreams of a Zionist homeland on all of Palestine?"

</p><p>He replied, "Everybody knows that. But if this initiative is given the required media coverage, and if the US, Europe, and the forces of peace in Israel support it, then Sharon will fall. But we have to show that we are serious in our initiative and are committed to the strategy of peace."

</p><p>She said, "I think that what is more important is internal building and clarifying the strategy of peace to the Palestinian people. We need to take practical steps towards strengthening legislative and legal institutions, respect of human rights, democracy, fighting corruption, and working on other issues that are the requirements of peace and development. Let me remind you of one of America's strategic mistakes: apart from her unconditional support to Israel and that is her support to corrupt and dictatorial regimes in the Arab world. This is one of the root causes of what happened in New York and Washington, D.C."

</p><p>He said, "All I'm hoping for is that Sharon will not have the last laugh!"

</p><p>After they drank some tea and she was about to go back to her home in preparation for the biggest night in her life, she leaned towards him putting her hand over his shoulder. She whispered, "Maybe in our children's times there won't be shaving razors." She left him and his gaze followed her.

</p><p>They brought him another cup of tea and his big brother took him by the arm to his room saying, "you have to rest for a little bit now." Smiling, his brother continued, "You have a long night ahead of you!"
