<p>I, a woman, am going to Palestine
<br>Non Violent Interposition in Defence of Palestinian Civilians
<br>For the Right to Life, Land and Freedom of the Palestinian people
<br>For Peace between Israelis and Palestinians

</p><p>The right and the need of Palestinian women, men and children to freely
live in justice and peace in a state of their own without suffering the
aggression of the Israeli military occupation, directly call to anyone
of us.
<br>Their upheaval is the response to the injustice and the violence of
Israeli military occupation.
<br>Every day, since September 27th, Palestinians are being killed by an
invading army and brutal settlers living in land confiscated from
Palestinian municipalities and peasants. Every day guns and rockets are
being used. Bombings and tortures are being practised. So far, more than
two hundred Palestinians have been killed, among them children, boys,
girls, women and men. More than 7,000 people have been wounded, someone
will be crippled for ever.
<br>Palestinians demand and call for the presence of UN forces on their
territories in order to be defended against the onslaught. Palestinian
women's committees are addressing an appeal to the world to wake it up
from its silence while Israeli soldiers are shooting to kill young boys
throwing stones.
<br>No country among those which call themselves democratic and civil, and
nor the UN, because of the US veto, have listened to this appeal and
undertaken effective actions in order to defend the Palestinian people.
<br>The powerful are looking on, in compliance, the onslaught of those who
claim their right to life, land and freedom.

</p><p><b>We, Italian women,</b> who believe in peace, want to answer their appeal and
go and see with our very eyes, show our solidarity in the places where
basic human rights are being violated.
<br>We are going to Palestine to do what the UN should do but do not want to
do : to interpose  ourselves peacefully in defence of the helpless and
to try to stop violence.
We want to keep on building relationships with women and men,
Palestinians and Israelis who work for a just peace: that is, for the
recognition of the Palestinian State within the 1967 borders, the coming
back of refugees to their homes, the dismantling of Israeli settlements,
Jerusalem as a city to share and capital of the two states.

</p><p><b>We demand the respect and the defence of international law.</b>
<br><b>We demand it from Italy, from Europe, from the UN and any country in the
world.</b> <b>Israel cannot be beyond any judgement.</b> The implementation of the
law is the only possible way for peace in the Middle East. It is the
only way to let Palestinians and Israelis finally live in peace.

</p><p><b>From Saturday the 2nd of December on and during a week, groups of women
will go in turn to Palestine and meet womens' associations, visit
hospitals, villages, bombed places, accompany peasant women under
settlers' threat and pick olives with them, stop at military check
points and participate in many other actions.</b>
