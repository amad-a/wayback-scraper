<p><b></b></p><div align="center"><b>Public Statement On Double Standards in the Israeli Judicial System</b>
</div>

<p>On January 21, Su'ad Ghazal a 17-year old Palestinian girl from Sebastia
village in the Israeli-occupied West Bank was sentenced by an Israeli
court to six and a half years in prison allegedly for attempting to stab
an Israeli settler.

</p><p>The extreme injustice of the sentence against Su'ad is underscored by
the fact that on the very same day another Israeli court allowed Nahum
Korman, the settler who pistol-whipped and kicked to death 11-year old
Hilmi Shusheh in 1996, to walk free with only a fine and six months of
community service. An unrepentant Korman told the media "I take no
responsibility for the boy's death...I admit to nothing, and I continue
to regard myself as innocent."

</p><p>These two sentences, along with countless other grave violations of
Palestinian children's rights once again highlight the urgent need for
international intervention and protection for Palestinians living under
Israeli military occupation.

</p><p>It is worth noting that Su'ad was only 15 when she was arrested; and she
spent most of the past two years in an Israeli prison. During her
detention, Su'ad has suffered severe physical and psychological abuse;
and the violation of most of her rights under the Fourth Geneva
Conventions and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child. The abuses include physical and psychological abuse; detention
without trial for an extended period; denial of education; detention of
a minor with adults; and illegal transfer from, and detention outside
the Occupied Territories.

</p><p>It is clear that Palestinians cannot get justice in the Israeli legal
system, as documented by numerous human rights organizations, and again
underlined by the fact that Nahum Korman was just freed with only fine
and community service.

</p><p>I call upon all advocates of justice in our world to demand that Israel
release Su'ad Ghazal and hold Israel to account for abuses of human
rights. Israel must not use double standards in its court system.

</p><p>Sincerely,

<b></b></p><p><b>Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj
<br>Director-General</b>
