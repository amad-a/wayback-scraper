 <p>I woke up this morning to hear the shocking news of my mother's house
 demolition. The Israeli Buldozers demolished the water well adjacent to
 the house, as well as tens of houses in the area. They also uprooted
 vast areas of fruitful agricultural land including Orange, Olive and
 Guafa groves. Many families in the area are homeless at the moment the
 Red Cross supplied them lately with tents.
 
 </p><p>I cannot explain to you how bad I feel; all my childhood memories, our
 family's proud moments when water was pumped from that well for the
 first time. I still remember my late father's rare photos, the minute I
 drank that water out of his hands .I still remember the joy, relatives,
 friends and neighbors coming to celebrate this moment with us.
 
 </p><p>The olive, orange and Guafa trees, and many other trees do not carry
 symbolic value only, but also they have great economical value. They are
 the lifelines for many families in the area. To these people,
 agriculture is their main and only income.
 
 </p><p>The Israelis aim to devastate our already devastated economy, to uproot
 us, to destroy our culture and to deny our very existence on this land
 for thousands of years.
 
 </p><p>It is worth to tell you that the Israeli army did not give any warning
 to us, or to the rest of the families, prior to the houses demolition.
 The houses were demolished with furniture inside.
 
 </p><p>As you know my mother lives in that house, but recently I invited her to
 live temporally with me to be able to take care of her during this
 difficult time.
 
 </p><p>My mother feels so bad about what happened. Our thoughts are with our
 neighbors who are very poor and have no alternative homes.
 
 </p><p>Beside all what I mentioned this is a big blow to the environment. Some
 of the trees, especially what we call "Jummaiz" trees, are very rare
 species.
 
 </p><p>What is happening is a big violation of human rights, economy
 environment and peace.
 
 </p><p>I feel angry, helpless, devastated and abandoned. The sad fact is that
 despite all these crimes against humanity, the Israelis do not care.
 <br>They know that they will, once again, get away with it. The support for
 the Palestinians is extremely fragile. The world is always willing to
 blame the victim, the Palestinians. However, I will not loose faith.
 During these difficult moments, I remember a very touching poem, which
 was written by the most gifted Palestinian poet, Mahmoud Darwish,
 <br>I came back from the dead,
 <br>To live
 <br>I represent an uncompromising wound,
 <br>The brutality of my executor has taught me,
 <br>To bite the bullet,
 <br>And carry on,
 <br>And sing,
 <br>I will sing,
 <br>I will resist,
 <br>I will resist.
 
 </p><p>I can assure you, that one day, we will replant these trees, rebuild our
 houses and water will be flowing again, even stronger than before,
 hopefully it will wipe out in its way the horrific memories of long
 decades of Israeli aggression.
 
 </p><p>We may be weak, but justice is on our side
 and one-day it will prevail
 
 </p><p>All my love,
