<p><b>Delegation of Palestinian Human Rights Activists Meets Marry Robinson
(UN High Commissioner for Human Rights)</b>

</p><p>On 12 November 2000, a delegation of Palestinian human rights
organizations met her Excellency Mrs. Marry Robinson, the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights, in Gaza. Mr. Raji Sourani, the director
of the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, started the meeting by
giving an overview of the continuing Israeli human rights violations
against the Palestinian people, and its violation of the 4th Geneva
Convention. He pointed that Israel used Oslo as a cover for its
settlement policies. He also indicated that Israel has tightened the
siege on Palestinian areas. Mr. Sourani called for international
protection for the Palestinian people.

</p><p>Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj stated that the root of evil in the Palestinian areas
is the occupation of Palestinian land. He called for the implementation
of UN resolutions and the only way to peace. He also pointed that the
world wants to avoid more bloodshed, indicating that Israel is sacred to
the US. To preserve Jewish blood and that of others in the area before
the situation turns to something like Kosovo or Bosnia, the
international community should intervene immediately.

</p><p>Dr. El-Sarraj presented Mrs. Robinson with a package of GCMHP research
of the mental health of children and the effects of trauma and torture.
