<p>Yes, I wanted to be with my pears and classmates. 

</p><p>We went to demonstrate , peacefully with thousands others. People were, young , adult and 
many , many children of my age. It was my first time to be with such a crowd ! It was my first 
time to participate in a demonstration!?  People were so close to each other , everyone was 
enthusiastically shouting , people were angry, they were several slogans… It’s the 53 years of 
Al Nakba , I know from my grandmother that Nakba meant for her , when she was forced to 
leave her home in Lifta. She explained to me , how painful it was for her and how scary , yet, 
she lived whole her life dreaming of her right to return.!! I guess, that most of those people , 
demonstrating , know about their grandparents and their parents tragedy! For me , I do not 
know Lifta, I’ve just visited it once with my grandparents and my mom. At that time it wasn’t 
clear to me , what it means Nakba  or even occupation?! The existence of the Israeli solders 
every where was something that I’ve seen since I was born. Yes, I do remember the first 
Intifada but it’s not so clear to me ,why, I mean why Israeli solders kill Palestinians!? I watch 
that on the TV and I hear everyone talking about the Israeli occupation and the Israeli 
aggression against us Palestinians ,I do feel the occupation , yet,  I try to adapt!! 

</p><p>Those days , the situation has changed dramatically , even if I wanted to accept that the Israeli 
occupation is a fact and I can do nothing to change this reality , and if I was dreaming that the 
Palestinian Authority will bring peace and end the occupation , even if I was dreaming of a 
bright future .. Now, as a member of  this crowd , No I can’t see except the dark .. 

</p><p>We all were moving towards the check point , actually I was moving without feeling that I’m 
walking freely , there was a kind of a power or a spirit moving me towards the check point, we 
are becoming closer and closer , we are so close , we look like the waves in the ocean , the big 
waves almost stopped at one stage, the youngsters continued to move further  and the youngest 
even were like the small waves going to the shore…!! 

</p><p>I feel as if the adult are trying to prevent us from moving further . No, I don’t want to stop , I 
can’t stop , look there is a child much younger than me , and he’s not afraid , he’s running 
towards the Israeli tanks, , yes, they are not jeeps, they are real tanks, I’m preparing my stones 
on my hands, yes, I want to threw stones on them , yes, I want to hit that tank, aren’t they the 
once who occupy my country? Aren’t they , the once who killed Palestinian children they are 
the once who killed Mohamad El Dura and others.. They are the once who are bulldozing our 
trees and houses every where , they are the once who don’t  allow us to move freely , they are 
the once who don’t allow me to go to Jerusalem with my parents.   They are the once who 
keep shelling on us at night and I can’t sleep , they are the once who make me scared every 
day.. Yes, I want to hit that tank , but oh , it’s so huge! It’s coming closer and closer.. I’m 
afraid, I’m trapped…I want to go back, I look ,oh most of my friends already left ,where are 
they? I can’t find them.!!Oh mummy I’m scared.! .No I can’t, I have to reach them ..No ,no, 
they are shooting on us, it’s live ammunition , oh someone is grasping my leg , oh, God, he’s 
injured, he’s bleeding, I’m scared.. I hear another child saying: don’t worry we’ll get him 
out..     People are so nice here , everyone loves everyone. !!I see many children are shot , they 
are falling down on the ground, but the tanks are becoming so close , they don’t stop shooting . 
I’m so scared, I don’t know what to do ?!  Suddenly, I felt big hands grasping me on my 
shoulders, screaming at me and my friend Faris, oh, she’s his mom , she came for our rescue , 
oh, what a relief !?? She’s pushing us back, I don’t feel how I’m going back, no ,I’m resisting , 
! 

</p><p>While leaving the battle- field, I see a small child running towards the tanks, towards death , no, 
I don’t want him to go there , I stopped him , he refuses , I’m giving him a very big Palestinian 
flag, that I bought just a while ago to hold it during the demonstration, yes, he agrees to get the 
flag  and get back. I’m so glad that he did. 

  

</p><p> I’m finally home, I have mixed feelings… I’m watching the TV, oh, God, they are showing our 
demonstration , how dangerous it was , I was going to die, I was almost shot ,my mom is silent, 
she’s saying nothing!! 

</p><p>I’m going to bed, I want to sleep , but I can’t, I can’t forget my feelings , it was horrible , I’m 
trying again and again to close my eyes and go to sleep but I can’t , I cry ,shout : Isn’t there 
anyone who can stop this crazy war? Stop all killings.. stop shooting, end occupation.. 

</p><p>I’m crying,  give us our freedom, give us our dreams…!!!
