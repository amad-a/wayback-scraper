     <p><b><font color="#FF0000">“Israel may have to restore moderate physical pressure on terrorist suspects,” 
</font></b>
 </p><p>Carmi Gillon (Israel’s ambassador designate to Denmark and former head of Israeli internal security) 

</p><p>This statement is a testimony by Mr. Carmi Gillon, a well informed source, that Israel has used 
and will use torture against Palestinians. How well informed is Mr. Gillon? 

  </p><p> 1.1995-1996, Head of Israel’s General Security Service (GSS or Shabak), which is the 
     internal security apparatus responsible for interrogating and torturing tens of thousands 
     of Palestinians. 

   </p><p>2.During his tenure at the head of the Shabak, Mr. Gillon admitted to have given 
     directives the lead to torture at least 320 Palestinian suspects. It is believed that one 
     person (Abed Al-Samid Hareizat) died during an interrogation that was authorized by 
     him (Al-Haq, 11 Jul 2001). 

</p><p>Mr. Carmi Gillon (Israel’s ambassador designate to Denmark) caused uproar in Denmark with 
this remark, stated in an interview with Danish TV. The furry came on the footsteps of an 
earlier controversy over his appointment as Israel’s ambassador to Denmark. The controversy 
over his appointment stemmed from his record of practicing and authorizing torture. 

</p><p>In response to the condemnation of his remarks, Mr. Gillon stated, “I told the truth; and I 
never regret telling the truth,” (Ha’aretz, 78, 249270). 

</p><p>Bravely, Mr. Gillon tried to justify the use of torture by saying that it is used against Islamic 
fundamentalists who do not volunteer information, especially about suicide bombers. If Mr. 
Gillon told the truth about the principle of using torture in Israel, he marred it with this 
justification. International and local human rights organizations have documented the fact that 
Israel has been using torture against Palestinian suspects, regardless of their ideology or 
political affiliations, since its establishment. 

</p><p>Mr. Gillon’s justification continues by claiming that torture is a defense of a democratic society 
surrounded by enemies. “Israel protects human rights, and we are the only country doing so in 
our neighborhood of piranhas,” claims Israel’s ambassador of torture in the same interview 
with Ha’aretz newspaper. 

</p><p>In light of Mr. Gillon’s testimony, one cannot but lament a State that justifies one of the most 
barbaric human rights violations in our time, while claiming to be an advocate of democracy. 
At the same time, the civilized world must act to stop this dangerous breach of human rights 
and principles of humanity. 

</p><p>Dr. Jens Modvig, the Secretary-General of the International Rehabilitation and Research 
Council for Torture Survivors in Denmark states, “The UN Convention against Torture 
(ratified by Israel in 1991) includes an absolute prohibition on the use of torture.” In addition, 
he says that, “The UN Convention against Torture includes a provision that if a suspected 
torturer is apprehended on a member State’s territory, the State is obliged to hand over the 
case to the competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution of the torturer, unless he is 
extradited….. If a State party to the Convention does not prosecute a person who is known 
to have participated in torture, or does ot allow another State to do so, the State does not live 
up to its obligations under the convention against torture.” 

</p><p>The Gaza Community Mental Health Programme calls upon all advocates of freedom and the 
principles of humanity to condemn Israel’s torture policy. In addition, the Programme calls 
upon the Government of Denmark to live up to its obligations under the UN Convention 
against Torture, and to prosecute Mr. Carmi Gillon if and when he sets foot on Danish soil.
