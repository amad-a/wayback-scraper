<br>Has time arrived at last for us to live in peace?. 
<br>Is it a coincidence that the three religions of the Middle east are simultaneously celebrating, Xmas, Hanukah, and Eid Alfitr Almubarak.?  
<br>Let us make it happen
<br>Don't let the forces of evil take it from us.
<br>Call on leaders to show courage and vision.
<br>We had enough of war, brutality, humiliation, and death.
<br>This is a beautiful country, now divided with hatred and fear. One day it will be reunited.
<br>And we will be
<br>Tall with dignity, not with guns 
<br>Flying in freedom , but within law
<br>Content in peace, away from surrender
 
</font></i></p><p><i><font color="#0000FF">For all that to happen, we have first to learn a new kind of power , the power of winning through losing, the power of grieving not dying.
<br>God bless the people who are the makers of peace.</font></i>
