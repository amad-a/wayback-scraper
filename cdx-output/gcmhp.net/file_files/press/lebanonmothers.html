<font color="#000066"><br><b>Urgent Action Appeal</b> 

<p>Mothers of 19 Lebanese prisoners held in Israeli jails are on a hunger 
strike to protest the continued detention of their sons despite Israeli 
withdrawal from Southern Lebanon.<br> The mothers started the strike on 7 August opposite the UN headquarters in Beirut. 

</p><p>Following the Israeli withdrawal and the disintegration of its proxy 
militia, Lebanese civilians stormed Khiam detention center in Southern 
Lebanon and freed the prisoners held in it.
<br> However, these 19 prisoners 
are being held in jails inside Israel.<br> The detention of these Lebanese prisoners constitutes a violation of the 4th Geneva Convention, to which 
Israel is a state party.</p><p> Some of this group have already ended the 
sentences issued by Israeli courts but remain imprisoned.<br> Others have 
not been tried despite years of detention. Israel is holding these 
Lebanese as “hostages.” 

</p><p>We call upon you to condemn this action and call for the immediate and 
unconditional release of these hostages by writing to the Israeli Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Justice at the addresses below. 

</p><p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak
