</p><p>Mrs. Mary Robinson
<br><b>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</b>

</p><p>0041-22-917-9016

</p><p>Dear Ms. Robinson,

</p><p>WE DEMAND INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION FOR PALESTINIANS

</p><p>Israel's recent unleashing of military forces, including tanks and
helicopter gunships, against unarmed or lightly armed Palestinian
civilians has underscored the Palestinians' urgent need for
international protection.

</p><p>Evidence from various hospitals indicates that Israeli forces have been
using lethal ammunition since the first day of the conflict, and are
targeting civilians' heads and chests. Clearly, this implies that
soldiers have been given "shoot to kill" orders, a contravention of the
Fourth Geneva Convention.

</p><p>Unlike all other refugee groups in the world today, Palestinians--the
world's largest and oldest refugee population--are not accorded legal
protection under existing international conventions, nor by the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Furthermore, Israel has
consistently refused to recognize its obligations under the Geneva
Conventions, particularly those clauses that protect civilians under
military occupation.

</p><p>To date over 100 Palestinians have been killed, half of them children
under the age of 15, while more than 3,000 have been wounded, any
suffering serious and incapacitating injuries, such as loss of eyes,
limbs and grave damage to internal organs. In addition, Israel continues
to bombard Palestinian towns and villages; and settlers rampage in
Palestinian towns with the protection of the Israeli army. Israeli Prime
Minister Barak threatens further violence.

</p><p>Even if demonstrations subside, it is certain that intransigent Israeli
policies will lead to more confrontation, and more slaughter, in the
weeks and months to come.

</p><p>This dangerous and violent situation continues because U.S. diplomatic,
economic, and military backing allows Israel to behave like a "rogue
state" without suffering the penalties other states so termed have been
subjected to. Permitting Israel to continue to kill and maim civilians
without being submitted to a UN commission of inquiry makes a mockery of
international law and undermines UN resolutions.

</p><p>We, the undersigned associations and individuals, submit this petition
to the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, requesting that he dispatch,
without delay, UN Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson to Jerusalem,
Gaza, the West Bank, and Arab communities in Israel to write a report on
the recent events.

</p><p>We call on the UN Human Rights Commission to extend the same levels and
types of protection to Palestinians as is extended to other refugees.
Failing this, we call for the formation of a special subcommittee within
the UN Commission for Economic and Social Rights to maintain a permanent
monitoring function in relation to abuses of the inalienable rights of
Palestinians. Palestinian refugees' rights must be considered no
different than the rights and needs of any other refugee group under the
terms of the 1951 Refugee Convention.  Furthermore, the rights and needs
of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, who remain stateless seven
years after the inception of the Oslo Accords, must also receive special
consideration.

</p><p>Sincerely yours,



</p><p>Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj
<br>Chairman, Board of Directors
