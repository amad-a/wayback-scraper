<br>On
<br>Executions and Assassinations</b></div>


<p>Over the past few weeks of the Palestinian-Israeli confrontations, a very disturbing trend has taken root. Israel adopted a policy of assassinating Palestinians accused of leading the Intifada. This policy relied on extensive intelligence and surveillance dependent on Palestinian collaborators. In return, the PNA responded to this policy by starting a crack down on collaborators who give information to Israel that leads to the death of Palestinian activists. The PNA tried and executed a number of these collaborators in a matter of days. 

</p><p>In addition, the Director of Palestinian TV and Radio Hisham Mikki was assassinated; and another Palestinian was killed in a family dispute.

</p><p>With regard to these events, the Programme stressed the following points:
</p><ul>
<li>	The policy of assassination is a clear and flagrant violation of international human rights standards. Regardless of the party that carries out the assassination and the reason behind it, no one can be judged with a fair and impartial trial that ensures the due judicial process that guarantees the rights of the accused.
</li><li>	The increase in Palestinian internal violence is a disturbing trend indicating the rising frustration in the confrontation with Israel and the redirection of energy inward. This is also evident in the execution of collaborators after hasty trials. The PNA should heed this dangerous signal and come up with adequate solutions.
</li><li>	The policy of assassination or executions is rejected under any circumstances. If an individual is accused of any crime. He\she should be given a fair and impartial trial. If guilt is established beyond reasonable doubt, the punishment must not violate the right of life. Therefore, the death penalty should not be used under any circumstances. 
</li><li>	GCMHP calls upon Israel to stop yet another grave violation of human rights represented by its policy of assassination. In addition, the Programme calls upon the PNA to stop using the death penalty in punishing collaborators.
</li></ul>
<p>Sincerely,

</p><p><b>Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj</b>
