<p><b>On 20 February</b>, Mr. Jonathan Laine, Deputy Head of the Canadian
Representative Office to the PNA, visited GCMHP and met Dr. Eyad
El-Sarraj (Director-General), Christina Abdel Shafi (Project Officer),
and Husam El-Nounou (PR Coordinator). The visit was for the purpose of
signing a cooperation agreement between the Canadian Government and
GCMHP to partially fund the Programme's Crisis Intervention Project.

<p>The Project conducts therapeutic and counseling activities aimed at all
sectors of Palestinian society subjected to the latest wave of Israeli
violence. The Project also carries out training activities for
professionals working with children and in the fields of education, as
well as a public awareness campaign on how to deal with the
psychological problem resulting from the Israeli aggression.

</p><p>Mr. Laine explained that this initiative is part of a large Canadian
project to support mental health in Palestine. This project consists of
$US 500,000 in financial aid for Palestinian NGOs. "The reason we chose
to support GCMHP is because we agree with the Programme's philosophy
that is based on a community mental health approach." Mr. Laine stated.
He also said that GCMHP's focus on preventive activities along side
therapeutic ones is very effective, especially with regard to issues
concerning children and women. Mr. Laine added that, "we work closely
with the National Committee to Support Childhood; and GCMHP is a member
of this Committee. GCMHP's Crisis Intervention Project falls within the
parameters of the Palestinian plan to support childhood, and the
Canadian strategy to support community mental health in Palestine."

</p><p>Mr. Laine indicated that the Canadian Government "works with
organizations that enjoy high levels of professionalism and have the
capacity and skills to implement projects effectively." This is one of
the reasons that led the Canadian Government to support GCMHP. The
Canadian Ministry for International Cooperation is interested to fund
projects that aim to help children in war-torn areas. Gaza is considered
such an area. "Her Excellency Ms. Maria Mena (Minister for International
Cooperation) approved the project to help Palestine since it goes along
side the philosophy of Canadian strategy in achieving social development
and well being, especially for children," he added.

</p><p>On his opinion about future cooperation between the Canadian Government
and GCMHP, Mr. Laine described this agreement as a stepping stone
towards more cooperation over the next two years. He indicated that
support will extend to the technical sphere in addition to financial
aid. He stressed the desire of the Canadian Government to include PNA
ministries (health, education, and social affairs) to work with civil
society institutions to make services more accessible to the population,
especially children.
