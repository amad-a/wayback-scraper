 <p><br>Mr. Ehud Barak
 <br>Prime Minister
 <br>Office of the Prime Minister
 <br>Israel
 
 </p><p><br>Dear Prime Minister Barak,
 
 <br>I write you to express my concern over the death of an 18-year old boy
 <br>due to the explosion of military remnants left in one of the abandoned
 <br>IDF training sites in the West Bank. This brings to four the number of
 <br>people killed by unexploded ordnance (UXO) in the past two months alone.
 <br>Since 1997, UXO or landmines have killed 37 people.
 
</p><p> This grave loss of life is caused by negligence that can be easily
 <br>avoided. Whoever and whatever caused the death of 37 people, the last of
 <br>which was 18-year old Massar Al-Kaabneh, should be held accountable to
 <br>the deed. It is unjustifiable and inexcusable for the IDF to leave
 <br>behind it dangerous materials that threaten people's lives. It saddens
 <br>me to know that if the first victim were someone other than a
 <br>Palestinian, measures would have been taken to solve this problem.
 
 </p><p><br>The next victim could easily be a tourist or even a settler. But this
 <br>alone should not move you to take action. The principle values of
 <br>humanity implore us to respect human life regardless of nationality or
 <br>religion.  I urge you to take the necessary actions to ensure that IDF
 <br>training sites are combed and cleared of hazardous material.
 
 </p><p>Sincerely,
 
 </p><p>Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj
 <br>Chairman,
 <br>Board of Directors
 
 
 </p></td></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div>
