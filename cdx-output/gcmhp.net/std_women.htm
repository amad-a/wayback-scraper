&nbsp;

<p>On 20 June, 1998, the <a href="/gcmhp.net/women.htm" style="">Women’s Empowerment Project
(WEP)</a> held a study day on “Suicide among Palestinian Women” in the
training hall at the Gaza Community Mental Health Program.&nbsp; Representatives
from the Program, Ministry of Social Affairs, Ministry of Wakf and Religious
Affairs, Ministry of Health, and Governmental Psychiatric Hospital attended
the study day, which aimed to coming up with therapeutic and preventive
mechanisms of action to this problem.

</p><p>Psychologist Azza Muheisin of the WEP presented a paper on “Suicide
among Palestinian Women” in which she pointed to the deteriorating political,
economic, and social conditions that resulted in increased social violence
against women and children.&nbsp; She also presented the preliminary results
of a study on suicide and university students’ opinions on this problem
and the suicide statistics from January 1996 to June 1998.&nbsp; These
statistics showed a significant increase in the number of women who attempt
suicide and the number of women who are killed.&nbsp; In addition, Ms.
Muheisin presented the results of a study on 25 women who attempted suicide
and highlighted their age, educational and economic background, and the
reasons that drove them to attempt suicide.

</p><p>Ms. Abier Jabir, Legal Counselor at the WEP, talked about the legal
aspects of suicide.&nbsp; She pointed to the existence of various laws
regarding this issue, and pointed to the fact that these laws are not enforced.&nbsp;
Ms. Jabir presented a number of cases at the <a href="/gcmhp.net/women.htm" style="">Women’s
Empowerment Project</a> as examples of the lack of enforcing the laws pertaining
to suicide.

</p><p>After discussing the topic at hand, the participants agreed on preventive
and therapeutic mechanisms of action between their respective organizations.
