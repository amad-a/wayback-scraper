<p dir="LTR">The aims of this study were to estimate the rate of posttraumatic
stress reactions in Palestinian children who experienced war traumas, and
to investigate the relationship between trauma-related factors and PTSD
reactions. The sample consisted of 239 children of 6 to 11 years of age.
Measures included the Rutter A2 (parent) and B2 (teacher) scales, the Gaza
Traumatic Event Checklist and the Child Post Traumatic Stress Reaction
Index. 174 children (72.8%) reported PTSD reactions of at least mild intensity,
while 98 (41%) reported moderate/severe PTSD reactions. Caseness on the
Rutter A2 scale was detected in 64 children (26.8%), which correlated well
with detection of PTSD reactions, but not with teacher-detected caseness.
The total number of experienced traumas was the best predictor of presence
and severity of PTSD. Intervention programmes for post-war children need
to be evaluated, taking into account developmental and cultural aspects,
as well as characteristics of the communities involved.

</p><p dir="LTR">In the last 15 years<b>, </b>there has been substantial research
in the phenomenology and prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorders
(PTSD) in at risk groups of children from different ethnic groups and cultures.
The majority of studies refer to young people exposed to natural catastrophic
events, such as floods (with prevalence of 37% at postflood and 7% at 17
years - Green et al., 1994), and hurricane disasters (short-term prevalence
of 3 through 9%: Shannon, Lonigan, Finch and Taylor, 1994; Garrison et
al., 1995). Also, following earthquakes, with rates varying from 37% to
91%, depending on the proximity (Pynoos et al., 1993). Other researchers
investigated children who had been exposed to community violence. Pynoos,
Frederick and Nader (1987) studied children who had been exposed to a sniper
attack at school. Nearly 40% were found to have moderate to severe PTSD.
Fourteen months later, Nader, Pynoos, Fairbanks and Frederick (1990) assessed
the same children and reported that 74% of those most severely exposed
in the playground still reported high levels of PTSD, whereas 19% of unexposed
children reported any degree of PTSD. Epidemiological studies differ in
their methodology and instruments used (screening, interviewing, two-stage
procedure) and their sample size.
</p><div dir="LTR">The impact of war on children has also attracted the attention
of the research community. Kinzie, Sack, Angell, Manson and Rath (1986)
followed-up children who had experienced war trauma, four years after leaving
Cambodia, and found that 50% had developed PTSD and mild, but prolonged
depression. In a 15-year follow-up of 59 Cambodian young adults, Hubbard,
Realmuto, Northwood and Masten (1995) established a prevalence of 24% for
PTSD, and a lifetime prevalence of 59% for the same disorder. Nader, Pynoos,
Fairbanks, Al-Ajeel and Al-Asfour (1993), in a study of Kuwaiti children
following the Gulf war, found that 70% reported moderate to severe post-traumatic
stress reactions. Weine et al. (1995) established PTSD in 25% and depression
in 17% of a small sample of Bosnian adolescents who had moved to America
during the Yugoslavian war, and Ahmad (1992) found the same rate in displaced
Kurdish children. Although depressive symptoms were equally elevated in
Croatian children during the war, displaced (refugee) children reported
more sadness and fear than local children, who had not moved from their
home residence (Zivcic, 1993).</div>

<div dir="LTR"><font face="Traditional Arabic">&nbsp;</font>In addition
to the prevalence of PTSD, mental health problems have been studied in
war victims in relation to experienced traumas. In Israel, about 40% of
kibbutz children presented with bereavement reactions of clinical significance,
including behavioural problems and social impairment, three years after
their father<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>s death in
war (Elizur and Kaffman, 1982). Those orphaned before the age of seven
tended to have a narrower awareness and differentiation of their broader
social environment (Lifshitz, 1976). In a study of 108 Palestinian children
in the Gaza strip, Qouta, Punamaki and El Sarraj (1995a), found that the
number of traumatic experiences was related to high levels of neuroticism,
and impairment of attention, concentration and memory.</div>

<div dir="LTR"><font face="Traditional Arabic">&nbsp;</font>Some studies
indicate that there may also be culturally-determined variations in the
presentation of anxiety or trauma-related disorders. Abu Hein, Qouta, Thabet
and El Sarraj (1993), for example, found a high rate (25%) of conversion
fits in Palestinian children living in the Gaza strip and exposed to traumatic
events during the war. Palestinian children living in the West Bank, were
also found to suffer predominantly from behavioural and psychosomatic problems
(Baker, 1990). Behavioural problems were more severe within the refugee
camps than in villages or cities. Somatising symptoms, on the other hand,
were more severe within the refugee camps and villages. In another study
from the Middle East, during the Lebanon civil war, Farhood et al. (1993)
found considerable prevalence of somatising symptoms, such as headaches,
in both male and female children.</div>

<div dir="LTR"><font face="Traditional Arabic">&nbsp;</font>The aims of
this study were to investigate: a) the prevalence of posttraumatic stress
reactions in Palestinian children who experienced war, b) the relationship
between traumatic experiences, behavioural and emotional problems, and
PTSD reactions, and c) the nature and frequency of PTSD reaction items
in this particular cultural sample.</div>


<p dir="LTR"><b><i><font color="#000066"><font size="+1">Materials and Methods</font></font></i></b>

</p><p dir="LTR"><b><i><font color="#000066">Sample</font></i></b>

</p><p dir="LTR">The Gaza strip is an elongated area that stretches along the
Mediterranean sea, between Israel and Egypt, covering 360 km<sup>2</sup>.
It is divided into five districts: North Gaza, Gaza city, Mid-zone, Khan
Younis and Rafah. In 1995, the Gaza Strip population was 860.369, excluding
returnees from abroad after the peace process. The Gaza Strip has a high
population density of 2.150 people per km<sup>2</sup>, which is an index
of environmental adversity. The total refugee population is 62.6%. About
55.1% live in eight crowded camps and the remaining 44.9% live outside
the camps in rural (villages) and urban areas (towns). In 1995, 50.8% of
the population were under 15 years of age, i.e. another risk factor for
child psychopathology.

</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font face="Traditional Arabic">&nbsp;</font></b>In the
first stage (Thabet, unpublished data), 981 children of 6-11 years were
selected by stratified quasi randomisation from the 97 Elementary schools
of the five districts, to be screened by teachers for behavioural and emotional
problems using the Rutter B2 Scale (Rutter, 1967). The return rate of the
questionnaires was very high (97%). The number of children screened according
to the original sample was 959. The <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>caseness<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
rates (i.e. possible presence of any mental health disorder) were calculated
using previously established cut-off scores of 9 (Rutter, Tizard and Whitmore,
1970). There were 422 children (44%) who scored positive and 537 (56%)
who scored negative.

</p><p dir="LTR"><font face="Traditional Arabic">&nbsp;</font>In the second
stage, 25% of children were randomly selected for collection of self-reported
and parent-rated data, while maintaining the ratio between positive:negative
cases=44%:56%. The sample of this study therefore consisted of 239 children
(105 positive and 134 negative cases). There were 129 boys and 110 girls.The
mean age of the sample was 8.9 years (6-11). According to place of residence,
42 came from north of Gaza Strip (17.6%), 103 from Gaza city (43.1%), 30
from the Middle area (12.6%), 41 from the Khan Younis area (17.2%), and
23 from the Rafah area (9.6%). The majority attended state schools (N=227,
or 95%), while 12 attended private schools (5%).

</p><p dir="LTR"><b><i><font color="#000066">Methods</font></i></b>

</p><p dir="LTR"><b>Rutter Scale A2 for compleby parents - Rutter, Tizard and
Whitmore, 1970.</b> This widely used and standardised measure of behavioural
and emotional problems in epidemiological research has been found to correlate
well with clinical interviews and to distinguish clinical from non-clinical
subjects, with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for children
of 6-13 years. Different cut-off scores have been established according
to sex and ethnic origin (Elander and Rutter, 1996). The scale consists
of 31 items measuring behavioural and emotional problems on a 0-2 scale.
Children with a total score of 13 or more have been found to be potential
<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>cases<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>,
i.e. presenting with a possible mental health disorder.

</p><p dir="LTR"><i><font face="Traditional Arabic">&nbsp;</font>Rutter Scale
B2 for completion by teachers - Rutter, 1967. </i>This is the equivalent
26-item form for teachers. Children with a total score of 9 or more have
been found to be potential cases. The Rutter Scales A2 and B2 were translated
into Arabic, following meetings with teachers and piloting of the translated
version.

</p><p dir="LTR"><i>Gaza Traumatic Event Checklist (Abu Hein et al., 1993).
</i>The
initial checklist was developed by the research department of the Gaza
Community Mental Health Programme and consisted of 17 items covering different
types of traumatic events that a child may have been exposed to (tear gas,
beating, witnessing beating, breaking limbs, imprisonment, siblings<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
imprisonment, injury, night raids, humiliation, and detention). The checklist
can be completed by children of 6-16 years (<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>yes<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
or <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>no<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
statements). Traumatic experiences can be classified as <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>few<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
(less than 5 traumatic events), <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>frequent<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
(5-9 events), or <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>many<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
(10 or more - Summerfield, 1993). A revised version of the checklist was
used in this study, with 21 items. These included different sensory types
of exposure to traumatic experiences, i.e. auditory, visual, or olfactory
experiences (Table 1).

</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font face="Traditional Arabic">&nbsp;</font></b><i>Child
Post Traumatic Stress Reaction Index (CPTSD-RI: Pynoos et al., 1987). </i>The
CPTSD-RI is a 20-item self-report scale designed to assess post-traumatic
stress reactions of children of 6-16 years following exposure to a broad
range of traumatic events (Frederick, 1985). The scale has been found valid
in detecting PTSD according to DSM-III-R criteria (American Psychiatric
Association, 1987). Inter-rater reliability for this instrument when administered
by a clinician has been reported to be high, with a Cohen kappa of 0.87
for inter-item agreement (Pynoos et al., 1987). Items are rated on a 0-4
scale. Scores were classified as <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>mild
PTSD reaction<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font> (total
score of 12-24), <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>moderate<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
(25-39), <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>severe<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
(40-59), and <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>very severe<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
(above 60 - Goenjian et al., 1995). The CPTSD-RI was also translated into
Arabic, following piloting.

</p><p dir="LTR"><b><i><font color="#000066">Statistical analysis</font></i></b>

</p><p dir="LTR">Descriptive statistics were used to present the characteristics
of the sample. Within-sample associations between continuous variables
were tested by Spearman rank correlation test. The proportion of cases
identified by different measures and informants were compared by McNemar
non-parametric test for related samples. The associations of categorical
(e.g. types of traumas) and continuous variables with presence of PTSD
reactions or caseness on the Rutter scales were tested by series of stepwise
forward regression analyses.

</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">The Rutter Scales</font></b>

</p><p dir="LTR">According to parent-completed Rutter A2 Scales (100% completion
rate), 64 children (26.8%)<b> </b>exceeded the cut-off score of 13<b>.
</b>The
mean total score was 8.27 (SD 7.0), with items

</p><p dir="LTR">frequency ranging from 0 to 32. The items most frequently
rated as <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">A</font>certainly applies<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">@</font>
(scale 2) were being restless (N=48, or 20.1%), irritable (N=33, or 13.8%),
worrying (N=26, or 10.9%), and bed wetting more than once per week (N=25,
or 10.5%). Somatising items were not rated very highly: 13 children (5.4%)
were rated as having headaches and 6 children (2.5%) as having asthma (both
on scale 2).

</p><p dir="LTR">The mean total score on the Rutter teacher scale was 10.5
(range 0-43). Teachers reported worrying (N=52, or 21.8%), restlessness
(N=52, or 21.8%), fearfulness (N=37, or 15.5%), and poor concentration
(N=36, or 15.1%) as the most frequent items on scale 2. Ten children (4.2%)
had aches on the same scale. Detection of caseness for any mental health
disorder by parents and teachers differed significantly (McNemar test:
x<sup>2</sup>=17.2, p&lt;0.0005). There was no significant sex difference
on the rates of caseness according to either parent or teacher scales.
Demographic data and instrument scores are presented in Table 2 for both
positive and negative subjects on the teacher Rutter A2 scales, according
to which this sample was selected.

</p><p dir="LTR"><i>Traumatic experiences (Gaza Traumatic Events Checklist)</i>

</p><p dir="LTR">Children were exposed to a wide range of traumatic experiences.
Of the 21 possible exposures, the average child endorsed an average of
4 (median: 3, mode: 0, range 0-15). The frequency of reported items is
presented in Table 1. Significantly more boys than girls had witnessed
breaking limbs of close friend (x<sup>2</sup>=5.6, p=0.02) and demolition
of their house (x<sup>2</sup>=6.1, p=0.01). The number of traumas experienced
was significantly correlated with children<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>s
age (Spearman rank correlation coefficient R=0.28, p&lt;0.0005), i.e. older
children had experienced more traumatic events.

<div dir="LTR">PTSD reactions were also dichotomised in a) present/absent,
and b) absent or mild/moderate or severe, which were entered as the dependent

number of traumatic events experienced (B=0.74, p&lt;0.0005) and living
north of Gaza city (which reflects a refugee population: B=1.79, p=0.006),
best predicted presence of PTSD reaction. The total number of traumatic

<div dir="LTR">&nbsp;</div>

<div dir="LTR">The total number of experienced traumas and the total PTSD
score were significantly associated (Spearman rank coefficient of correlation
R=0.64, p=0.000). Among the traumatic events, presence of PTSD reaction
was best predicted by having experienced tear gas attacks (B=0.95, p=0.001),
and having witnessed beating of friend (B=0.95, p=0.001) or day raids (B=0.60,
p=0.006). A moderate to severe PTSD reaction was best predicted by having
experienced tear gas attacks (B=0.71, p=0.001), and having witnessed the
killing (B=0.68, p=0.003) or beating of a friend (B=0.41, p=0.01).</div>

<div dir="LTR">The proportion of detected <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>cases<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
by parents on the Rutter A2 scale and detected PTSD reactions on the CPTSD-RI
did not differ significantly (McNemar test: x<sup>2</sup>=0.00, p=0.99).
There was, however, significant difference on the detection of <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>caseness<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
by teachers on the Rutter B2 scale and of PTSD on the CPTSD-RI (x<sup>2</sup>=11.9,
p=0.0006).</div>


<p dir="LTR"><b><i><font color="#000066"><font size="+1">Discussion</font></font></i></b>

</p><p dir="LTR">This study found high rates of posttraumatic stress reactions
in children of primary school age, who had experienced war. According to
children<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>s reports, 73.2%
reported PTSD reactions of at least mild severity, whilst 39% reported
moderate to severe reactions. A limitation was the absence of assessment
of global functioning or a clinical interview in addition to the CPTSD-RI,
in order to establish whether children met all criteria for a post-traumatic
stress disorder. Although a number of studies have used the CPTSD-RI and
the classification of its total scores into <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>mild,
moderate, severe and very severe<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
reactions (e.g. Nader et al., 1993; Shawet al., 1995), the clinical implications
of the scoring sysremain unclear. Goenjian et al. (1995) found that the
<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>severe<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
categories correctly identified 78% of subjects who met DSM-III-R criteria
for PTSD. However, if the CPTSD-RI was used for screening purposes, children
of at least <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>moderate<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
severity should also be included. About 27.5% of children were potential
cases of mental health disorder according to parental ratings on the Rutter
A2 scale, a rate similar to other deprived urban populations.

</p><p dir="LTR">Children who lived north of Gaza city, an area of refugee
camps, were more likely to experience PTSD. The refugee population may
reflect mediating adversities such as relocation and disruption of school
life or peer relationships. It could also reflect higher exposure to life
events such as house demolition (Qouta, Punamaki and El Sarraj, 1997).
The previous finding of dose-effect relationship between cumulative trauma
and PTSD symptoms (e.g. Mollica, Poole, Son, Murray and Tor, 1997) was
replicated in this population. The research was carried out following the
peace accord. In a longitudinal study of Palestinian children living in
the Gaza strip, Quota, Punamaki and El Sarraj (1995b) found that their
level of neuroticism was significantly lower after the peace treaty than
before. Earlier exposure to traumatic experiences and non-acceptance of
the treaty (continuing political activity and non-participation in peace
treaty festivities) predicted increased neuroticism and low self-esteem.

</p><p dir="LTR">Although we investigated the extent of trauma and its impact
on PTSD, other possible mediating variables, such as family functioning,
adult perceptions of trauma or perceived parenting (Elizur and Kaffman,
1983; Laor et al., 1997; Punamaki, Qouta and El Sarraj, 1997), and their
interaction with trauma, were not accounted for in this study. Secondary
adversities such as school and social network disruption are also important.
For example, Farhood et al. (1993) found that Lebanese family members were
confident that they could rely on social support to deal with problems
of various natures during the war. A high level of social support, family
cohesiveness and family communication has been found to protect children
by mediating the effect of war trauma (Ziv and Israeli, 1973; Cohen and
Dotan, 1976; Figley, 1983).

</p><p dir="LTR">Despite the war, there was relative stability in our population
to enable them to continue to attend school, which could thus form the
basis for detection of children most at risk and intervention (Yule, 1992,
1994). General screening instruments with high sensitivity and specificity
such as the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, which has since extended
the Rutter scales used in this study (Goodman, 1997), would be appropriate.
As mentioned above, the use of specific instruments, such as the CPTSD-RI,
for screening purposes is less well established, in which case a cut-off
score indicative of <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>low
to moderate<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font> severity
could be adopted.

</p><p dir="LTR">As there was a substantial proportion of cases undetected
by teachers, screening methods should also involve children and parents.
The significant difference on rates of cases detected by parents and teachers
could be related to the nature and presentation of mental health problems
(situation-specific) or lack of awareness by teachers (Kent, Vostanis and
Feehan, 1995). Discrepancy between teacher and parent reports has been
previously found on different child mental health symptoms and disorders,
particularly emotional problems such as those characterising this sample
(Kolko and Kazdin, 1993). Compliance with such programmes is likely to
be high in close communities, as demonstrated by the participation rate
in this study. Goenjian et al. (1995) suggested a realistic and cost-effective
method of screening, i.e. periodic monitoring of secondary adversities
that may have a cumulative risk effect, and precipitate new-onset disorders.

</p><p dir="LTR">A <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>cultural<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
hypothesis on the phenomenology of mental health and PTSD symptoms was
not supported. For example, children did not present predominantly with
somatising or behavioural problems. High rates of cognitive and emotional
PTSD symptoms were reported. Previous research with victims of war trauma
has supported the validity of PTSD <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>beyond
the barriers of culture and language<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
(Sack, Seeley and Clarke, 1997). In another epidemiological study by the
authors with a different and older sample of Palestinian children of 9-13
years of age (Thabet and Vostanis, in press), children reported high rates
of significant anxiety problems (21.5%) and similar phenomenology to western
populations. Anxiety symptoms were associated with socio-economic deprivation,
while the higher prevalence rates among females was explained by the 12-13
year-old children of that sample (in contrast with the younger sample of
the present study).

</p><p dir="LTR">Future research could address cultural variations by studying
the perceived impact of the trauma and the children<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>s
<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>meaning<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
of it among different cultures. Eisenbruch (1991) proposed an interesting
concept of <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>cultural bereavement<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>,
which includes the refugees<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
picture - what the trauma meant to them; their cultural ways of signaling
distress; and their cultural strategies for overcoming it. At the same
time, certain coping mechanisms and protective factors appear to be independent
of culture and societal structure. In a review of the psychological effects
of war on children, Jensen and Shaw (1993) put forward a positive message
on the development of coping skills due to children<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>s
<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>cognitive
immaturity, plasticity and innate adaptive capacities, which can protect
from trauma in low-to-moderate war time settings<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>.

</p><p dir="LTR">The development and evaluation of treatment interventions
for post-war child populations, where <font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">&gt;</font>natural
community groupings exist<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>
(Yule, 1994), can be school- and group-based. Galante and Foa (1986) demonstrated
the effectiveness of school-based group treatment for at risk children
following earthquake in Italy (seven hourly sessions for one week). Brief
cognitive-behavioural treatment that aimed at improving children<font face="WP TypographicSymbols,Symbol">=</font>s
locus of control and self-esteem has also been described (Baker, 1990).
Parents should be involved in these programmes as far as possible.
