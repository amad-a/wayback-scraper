<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"><b><i>The relationship</i></b> between
the nature and severity of experiences of torture and ill- treatment and
post traumatic disorder (PTSD) symptoms was studied in 550 male non help-seeking
Palestinian political ex-prisoners from the Gaza Strip. Results showed
that the more a prisoner had been exposed to physical, chemical and electric
torture, psychological ill-treatment and sensory deprivation or bombardment,
the more he subsequently suffered from intrusive re experiencing, withdrawal
and numbness, and hyper arousal. Existential problems were not related
to torture experiences. Furthermore, duration of imprisonment, health problems
during the imprisonment, harassment during arrest and after release, Family
marriage and economic difficulties all predicted intrusive re experiences
of trauma. Also ex-prisoners who continued to be harassed by military authorities
and had economic problems suffered more from withdrawal numbness, and hyper
arousal than others.</font></div>
