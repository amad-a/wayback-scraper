<p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1"><font color="#000066">Philosophy</font>
<font color="#000066">And</font> <font color="#000066">Strategy</font></font></font></i></b>

</p><p><font color="#000066"><b><i><font size="+1">Gaza</font></i></b> <b><i><font size="+1">Community
Mental Health Programme</font></i></b> was established in April 1990, to
meet the immediate needs of the population of Gaza Strip for mental health
care during the upheaval of the Intifada and the systematic state organized
violence. Much of our activities were to help the traumatised children
and the victims of torture. The most immediate task was to train the workers
who would deliver such a service when only few had any experience in Mental
Health . In a culture of conservatism, ancient strong traditions and resistance
to change, our endeavour was a challenge. Taboos and ignorance deform growth.
Believing in the devil possession of the "mad" and the resort to exorcism,
the presentation of the body to express the emotional suffering , the resistance
to acknowledge "weakness" are to be challenged .</font>

</p><p><font color="#000066">The first four years were then spent on training
a selected number of workers and to engage ourselves in the community education
and train community workers, doctors, teachers, nurses and parents . In
the same time we established a wide network of friends, supporters and
professionals in Palestine and elsewhere . We invited and hosted hundreds
of experts friends, many conducted courses, seminars or workshops . We
campaigned for human rights joining our friends in Palestine, Israel, and
the rest of the world .</font>

</p><p><font color="#000066">With the signing of the declaration of principles
between the PLO and Israel, the Palestinian community entered a new era
with immense challenges and opportunities . The national strategy should
be aimed at strengthening the human resources and democracy, rebuilding
the social fabric and infrastructure, and starting intensive and dynamic
debate between all sectors of the Palestinian community on the future of
political. economic, environmental, educational and human strategies .
In many ways we are a nation coming out from the rubble with the determination
to survive and with the new spirit of building. We have to acknowledge
our losses, our pain and our trauma . Thousands of our children and many
more of our adults were exposed to violence and torture. They lost their
education and their dreams . Many grieve in silence and some will never
forget . An immediate task of the GCMHP will be to treat and rehabilitate
the victims of both Israeli torture and communal structural violence. In
the meantime preventive community work and education should be started
with an emphasis on children, family and mental health .</font>
<br><font color="#000066">Due to a long history of living under colonial,
oppressive rule, the Palestinian community has always felt alienated from
the authority of the land which has affected attitudes towards public and
state property and affairs. In the spirit of building the country, community
awareness campaigning should start with sensitivity in order to build a
strong identification between the individual and the community based on
respect for human rights and democracy. Taboos such as the abuse of women
and children should be challenged and exposed .</font>

</p><p><font color="#000066">In primary health care sector, most doctors are
poorly grounded in the areas of mental health and psychiatry . This ignorance
has serious effects given that almost all psychiatric cases are presented
in somatic forms and complaints. The education of all workers in the health
sector should include the mental health component .</font>

</p><p><font color="#000066">Children should be the central focus of educators,
planners, and community leaders . Parents and teachers should be encouraged
to communicate with children and be sensitised to children's perception
and behaviour.</font>

</p><p><font color="#000066">Women have traditionally been denied fundamental
rights. In a traditional patriarchal society like ours, man's authority
is dominant. Women should be encouraged to take equal place in building
the society alongside men .</font>

</p><p><font color="#000066">GCMHP will work in co-operation and co-ordination
with all Palestinian institutes whether governmental or non-governmental
. GCMHP will continue to function as an independent non-governmental organisation.
Over the period of five to seven years GCMHP aims to become a focal point
for education, learning and training with academic accreditation. The need
for strengthening our resources have been never greater, and the support
of our friends is vital.</font>
