<br><font color="#000000">On 5 July 1998, GCMHP hosted Dr. David Henley,
a Swedish specialist working in the Palestinian Solidarity Association
in Sweden, to give a lecture on “Community Based Rehabilitation” to staff
members.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font color="#000000">In his lecture, Dr. Henley defined rehabilitation
and the different rehabilitation methods. In addition, he talked about
benefiting from different social powers such as family and friends to ensure
the success of the rehabilitation process.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font color="#000000">Dr. Henley also gave two examples of community
based rehabilitation. The first was on how to use this type of rehabilitation
to help people suffering from physical handicaps caused by violence. The
second example was on how to use community based rehabilitation to help
those suffering from psychological disorders, especially children and teenagers.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font color="#000000">Extensive discussion on this issue followed the
lecture. Moreover, it was agreed that a group of GCMHP staff members will
work to develop a community based rehabilitation project. This project
will take into account benefiting from different powers in society such
as parents, teachers, school counselors, social workers, and medical professionals
in order to offer rehabilitation services to the people that rehabilitation
specialists cannot reach.</font>
