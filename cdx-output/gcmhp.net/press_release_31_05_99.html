<br><b><i><font color="#FF0000">( 31.05.99 )</font></i></b>
<br><font color="#006600"><font size="+1">(Public statment on the death of
SHADI SAQER in</font></font>
<br><font color="#006600"><font size="+1">an Israeli prison )</font></font>

<p><font size="+1">Shadi Saker Abu Dahrouj (21 - from Jabalia) died in his
holding cell in the Beir Sheva prison, better known as the Negev or Ansar
III prison.&nbsp; What was the crime that Shadi committed to merit this
punishment?&nbsp; Did he kill the Israeli PM? Did he plan to blow up a
bomb in Tel Aviv? Was he a member of a terrorist organization? Was he a
ticking "time bomb" as the Israeli security establishment classifies "dangerous"
prisoners? The answer simply is that Shadi was working in Israel, and was
arrested by the Israeli security.</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">Shadi was suffering from a heart condition.&nbsp; Where
were the doctors of the prison? How was he locked up in a cell without
notice of his physical ailment? Are doctors in prisons only to evaluate
how much damage prisoners can take?</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">This shocking incident comes at a time when our hope was
rekindled in breaking the deadlock in the peace process.&nbsp; Yet, it
comes as a reminder to us that peace cannot be achieved without all sides
unconditionally agreeing to the respect of human rights.&nbsp; The respect
of human rights should be a key component to any political settlement in
the region.</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">In order to prevent the occurrence of this incidence we
should:</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">1- Request that international human rights organizations
intervene to guarantee Israeli adherence to international declarations
on human rights.</font>
<br><font size="+1">2- Request that an independent, international investigating
committee visits Israeli prisons to evaluate the conditions of Palestinian
prisoners.</font>
<br><font size="+1">3- Requesting the international community to pressure
Israel to stop torture and abolish all regulations allowing the use of
torture.</font>
<br><font size="+1">4- Requesting the international community to pressure
Israel to release all Palestinian prisoners?&nbsp; If they are terrorists,
what is the classifications of all the "free" Israelis walking the streets
and Knesset halls with Palestinian blood on their hands.</font>
<br><font size="+1">5- Requesting the sponsors of the peace process and the
donor countries to include the respect of human rights as a key component
in any political settlement, and a precondition for economic aid.</font>
