<p>The Gaza Community Mental Health Programme's fourth international conference
began today in the Rashad El-Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City, Palestine.
The theme of this year's November 21-23 conference is Women in Palestine.
The conference brings together over 800 professionals, researchers, academics,
and activists from throughout the world to discuss the status of women
and their problems, aspirations, and future role in development. It includes
about 80 presentations in 24 workshops.
<br>The conference features a photo exhibit by GCMHP’s Women’s Empowerment
Project.&nbsp; There is also an exhibition of handicraft products of different
women’s organizations in Gaza.
</p><p>Ms. Sama Aweidah of Women’s Studies Center, Palestine, delivered the
opening speech: Palestinian Women's Rights from a Palestinian Feminist
Perspective. Ms. Aweidah argued that despite all the sacrifices Palestinian
women have offered for building the society, they still have a low status
in the society. She pointed out various reasons for this like the exclusion
of women from decision-making positions, the discrimination of women in
the law, as well as social stereotypes of women as week creatures who can
not be trusted, nor take responsibility. Ms. Aweidah further pointed that
as low status of women is an obstacle to development of the society, it
needs to be upgraded. We can not ignore the requirement for women when
building the Palestinian State. The development process begins with the
human being and it ends with the human being. Therefore, she hopes that
the issue of women will soon be placed in its right order.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>Dr. Amin Mekki Medani, chief technical advisor of the UN High Commissioner
for Human Rights, stressed that women’s rights are an integral and inalienable
part of human rights. He further stressed the importance of a symbiotic
partnership that law, legislators, civil society and the State share in
the matter of the rights of women. He claimed a special responsibility
rests upon civil society and the community to support law enforcement and
prosecution with the needed demand for their response. He expressed hope
to see more coordination between communities and law enforcement to eliminate
crimes typically carried out against women. In conclusion he said that
the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is available to support and offer
technical assistance on the ground and through access to treaty bodies
and the UN system at large.
</p><p>The plenary session was followed by the Awards’ Ceremony for some Pioneer
Palestinian Women, where Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj, Director of the Gaza Community
Mental Health Programme presented awards to Ms. Najla Yassin (Um Nasser),
Head of the General Union of Palestinian Women, Her Excellency Ms. Intisar
El-Wazir, Minister of Social Affairs, Dr. Hanan Ashrawi¸ Secretary
General of Muftah, The late Dr. Firyal El-Bannah,&nbsp; the late Ms. Samieha
Khaliel, The Women’s Affairs Center and finally to Um Jabir Wishah
</p><p>Three concurrent workshop sessions were held in the morning. In the
first one on Women and Human Rights, Dr. Abdallah Abu Eid of Najah University,
Nablus, spoke on Palestinian Women’s Struggle for Equality. He stressed
the irrationality of asking for equity at the present time but rather stressed
stepwise fusion. Also he suggested collaboration rather than opposition
of men in their request.
<br>Ms. Turid Smith Polfus of University of Oslo, Norway, delivered a presentation
on Are Human Rights Anti Women?&nbsp; She stressed that even international
human rights charters did not perserve women’s rights as they were all
with androcentic focus. She also made comparison about domestic violence
and violence at hands of prison officials where she fund strikingly similarities
on methods and impacts on the victims.
<br>Ms. Areen Hawari of the Arab Association for Human Rights, Nazareth,
spoke on Palestinian Women in Israel. Ms. Hawari claimed that Palestinian
women in Israel are abused both as Palestinians as well as women. She also

Law.

of Birzeit University and Dr. Mustafa Abu Sway of Al-Quds University were

and Feminism and Women in Islam: The Cultural vs. the Religious as they
were not given the permission by the Israelis to enter Gaza.
<br>Dr. Violette Dagguerre of the Arab Commission for Human Rights in France
spoke on Hidjab, Excision, and Marriage in Islam. Dr. Dagguerre’s claim
that hidjab is underestimating the women’s position in community led to
a discussion on her point of view on the hidjab and islam.

Islam. Dr. Abu Bakr referred to contemporary interpretation of the Quaran,
where responsibility lies on both men and women to take care of the family.

of East Jerusalem YMCA Rehabilitation Program spoke on Handicapped Women
and Employment Opportunities. She said that the work opportunities for
women in general are few, however they are even less for handicapped women.
Further, handicapped women suffer from lack of opportunities of education
and training.
<br>Ms. Zeinab El-Ghoneimi of Ministry of Labor spoke on Palestinian Women
and Labor. She argued that the low rate of women in the work force is due
to high rates of unemployment in general, weakness of economic structures,
and the correlation between Palestinian and Israeli economy.
<br>Mr. Luay Shabaneh of the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics spoke
on Women and Labor in the Palestinian Areas. He outlined basic indicators
related to work marketing and women’s participation. He argued that women’s
participation in the work force is determined by the women’s education
level, culture and social status.
