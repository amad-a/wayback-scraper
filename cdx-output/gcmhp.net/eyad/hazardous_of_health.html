<p>It might be acceptable to say that people have become accustomed to
discontent and complaint throughout the centuries of foreign rule.&nbsp;
It is safe to say that the Palestinian self-rule experience is in its infancy,
sometimes moving forward and other times stumbling; but it, nonetheless,
is a river running its course, as described by Mr. Hussien Hijazi’s article
in Al-Ayyam on 27 September 1998.&nbsp; In his article, he says that corruption
and corrupt people are like wood splinters the float on the surface of
a big river.
</p><p>We can find the reasoning for people’s complaints in the fact that their
interests are hindered by bureaucracy.&nbsp; It is now extremely difficult
to obtain permission to open a commercial company; thus raising the question
as to whether there is a policy to hinder economic growth rather than encourage
it.&nbsp; Simultaneously, there are people who take pride in the achievements
of the Palestinian Authority in building our society, establishing ministries
and organizations, infrastructure projects, negotiations with Israel, and
in the United Nations.&nbsp; One might even agree that the threat to declare
a Palestinian State forced Israel to withdraw from some Palestinian land
and stop settlement activity in other Palestinian areas.
</p><p>However, there is no justification to the severe lack of pharmaceutical
products from governmental healthcare centers, leading to doctors in the
Ramallah hospital threat to halt all surgery due to the lack of silk and
cat gut.&nbsp; It is also impossible to understand why the Ministry of
Health does not have a reserve of children vaccinations for next year.&nbsp;
Do bureaucracy and neglect justify depriving our children of their vaccinations?
</p><p>Minister of Health, Dr. Riyad El-Za’noun, undertook the responsibility
of rebuilding the Ministry of Health.&nbsp; He invested a lot of time and
effort in this task even before the establishment of the Palestinian Authority.&nbsp;
Nonetheless, we find Palestinian health concerns still at a crucial crossroads.&nbsp;
What is the reason?
</p><p>The Minister of Health says that he has no specific budget allocated
to the it; and the Finance Ministry says that they don’t have any finances.
</p><p>Where is the truth?&nbsp; Some say that the Finance Ministry spends
large sums of money on lavish apartments and fancy cars for “influential
people” in Gaza and Ramallah.
</p><p>Is it a matter of priorities?&nbsp; Is it bad planning and administration?
Where is the role of the old and new Cabinets?&nbsp; Is it the responsibility
of the Legislative Council? How long can we stay quiet on this danger threatening
the lives of our children?
</p><p>The Palestinian Ministry of Health is full of problems.&nbsp; There
are administrative problems and power center affecting appointments and
operations.&nbsp; Knowing the health situation in Palestine, the Ministry
of Health only spends $US 30 per capita annually, whereas the Israeli Ministry
of Health spends $US 600.
</p><p>Before asking mercy from the world, we should be merciful towards ourselves.
