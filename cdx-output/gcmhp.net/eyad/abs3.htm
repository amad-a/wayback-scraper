<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"><b><i><font size="+1">Our aim</font></i></b>
was to describe different types of prison experience and to analyze their
relations with background and psychological variables. Seventy-nine male
Palestinian ex-prisoners were interviewed about their prison experiences,
ways of coping, personality, and psychological well-being. The results
of qualitative analysis revealed seven different types of prison experience.
Only one of these reflected exclusively negative feelings, characterized
by suffering and disillusionment. The others also included relatively rewarding
perceptions characterized as a struggle between strength and weakness,
heroic fulfillment, developmental tasks, a normative stage in a man's life,
growth in personal insight, and return to religion. Results showed that
older men, town residents, and those exposed to a high level of torture
perceived the imprisonment more as suffering and disillusionment than other
men. Ex-prisoners, who perceived their experience as suffering and disillusionment,
typically coped by using wishful thinking, avoidance, escape, and distraction.
Torture and ill-treatment increased wishful thinking and self-controlling
as coping styles.</font></div>
