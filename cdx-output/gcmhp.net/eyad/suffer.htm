<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"><b><i>The debacle</i></b> of 1948 is
considered a turning point in the mental state of the palestinian people
and society. This event has left its mark on the generations born since.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">So has the Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Its effect on the social and economic structures
of those areas is everywhere to be seen. So has the violation of human
rights, the thousands imprisoned and rendered homeless: These events have
deeply of the Palestinians.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">If the Intifada was a popular expression
of the Palestinian people's refusal to accept occupation, it was also an
operation to cure themselves of the feeling of impotence and of the mental
pains that had assailed them in the years before the Intifada began.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">In the first years of the Intifada,
Palestinians cultivated a positive image of themselves. More than merely
giving vent to their anger, they were taking their fate into their hands.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">For this freedom, they paid a high price:
1,474 killed; 150,000 incarcerated; 130,000 wounded, amongst them thousands
maimed for life.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">From the point of view of mental health,
the oppressive measures used by the occupation forces have had a deteriorating
effect at all levels of Palestinian society, bringing about an increase
in mental problems.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">A 1992 study by the Gaza Community Mental
Health Program establishes that 12 percent of the adult population is suffering
from severe depression.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The situation has had a damaging effect
on the growth and development of children. A child is certainly affected
by the sudden house search methods of Israeli occupation forces, and by
the sight of his or her father being humiliated. These mental grievances
are compounded by long stretches of school closures.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Besides, children have been shot at
by live rounds and rubber bullets, leaving them more often than not with
injuries difficult to heal.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Studying the cases of 2,590 children,
the Gaza Community Mental Health Program established the following:</font>
</p><ol>
<li>
<font color="#000066">85 percent were exposed to cases of raids and house
searches by the occupation forces.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000066">4.5 percent suffered from broken bones.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000066">42 percent were beaten.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000066">55 percent had watched as their fathers were beaten
and humiliated.</font></li>
</ol>

<dir>
<dir>
<div dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">Another study reflects the following:</font></b></div>
</dir>
</dir>

<ol>
<li>
<font color="#000066">14 percent are suffering from various manifestations
of mental deterioration (bed-wetting, loss of appetite, sleeplessness,
loss of speech).</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000066">30 percent are suffering from behavioral outbursts
that can be traced to the cumulative effect of the suffering of several
generations.</font></li>
</ol>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;Women, on the other hand, have
been exposed to an unexpected source of violence. Relegated to a secondary
rank and still considered - just like every where in the Third World -
as the source of warmth and tenderness and support for child and husband
alike, women in the West Bank and Gaza are also now learning to bear the
brunt of their husbands' wrath. Husbands humiliated by the occupation forces
often take out their anger on their wives.</font>
<br><font color="#000066">&nbsp;</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">But on the whole, the occupation has
called for more mental strength among women than ever before. With many
husbands either killed, imprisoned or expelled, women have had to take
on greater responsibilities and to cope with greater pressures.</font>
