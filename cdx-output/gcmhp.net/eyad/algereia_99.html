<font color="#000000">Before I start my paper on the question of psychology
and trauma, I would like to comment, as an Arab, on what has been said
so far today.&nbsp; I think that we have heard the Algerian situation discussed
from two important angles: Dr Shaban's paper reflected the distinct sense
of helplessness that one feels concerning this situation, whereas Dr Sourani's
is a cry of protest, an expression of the need to do something.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">I think that one of the gravest implications of
the Algerian situation today is that it is repeatable, that the possibility
exists for similar scenarios to be played out in every Arab country.&nbsp;
From what has been said today, the seriousness of the situation becomes
apparent.&nbsp; Arab culture lacks democracy, lacks respect for the rule
of law, and is totally dominated by corrupt regimes that have no respect
whatsoever for human life and dignity.&nbsp; All Arab regimes can be described
this way, without exception.&nbsp; In addition, all Arab countries are
now candidates for division and ethnic wars, because there are so many
ethnic groups, religions, and so many tribal divisions within each and
every one of the these countries.&nbsp; The crucial question now is this:
Are internal conflicts after independence really so inevitable, or is there
a way that we can avoid this fate? We cannot rely on the Arab regimes,
because they are there to enjoy power.&nbsp; In fact, they behave like
a Mafia, coming to each other's aid but rather than helping the people
they protect one another from their own people.&nbsp; One cannot rely on
the Arab League, because it only serves as a club for these corrupt regimes.&nbsp;
The argument of sovereignty, so often put forward to ward off outside intervention,
rings very hollow when it comes from the junta in Algeria.&nbsp; What is
sovereignty when your people are being killed by your own army, and by
religious extremists? Where is sovereignty here? When the Lebanese were
killing each other, many of the victims did not even know why.&nbsp; Where
is sovereignty? These regimes are promoting the slogan of sovereignty in
order to divert the attention from the real problem.&nbsp; And the real
problem is the nature of these Arab regimes.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">Perhaps in Palestine today we are luckier than
the people of Algeria.&nbsp; Even with all of our grievances against the
brutal, thirty-year Israeli occupation, even considering the forced uprooting
that has left 70 per cent of us living in refugee camps and in exile; even
with all of that, perhaps we are still luckier than those living in Algeria
today.&nbsp; As Palestinians we had a common enemy, we were united in our
struggle against Israel, we had our land to liberate.&nbsp; In Algeria
they finished with their struggle long ago when they rid themselves of
French colonialism in the 1960s.&nbsp; With the cohesive force of the outside
enemy gone, they ended up with an internal enemy.&nbsp; And this is what
every Arab country is heading for, what we in Palestine are now heading
for - if we do not learn from the lessons of Algeria.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">To return to the issue of trauma and after-care:&nbsp;
Let me give you just a few examples of the effects of trauma on the psychology
of children and adults in Palestine today.&nbsp; The latest research results
tell us that 17 per cent of the adults in Gaza suffer from clinical depression.&nbsp;
This is a staggering figure by any standard - in no country in the world
is depression estimated to be more than 4 per cent of its total adult population.&nbsp;
In Gaza this statistic is, I repeat 17 per cent (the research resulting
in this finding was carried out according to strict methodology based on
internationally accepted research tools, through co-operative efforts between
various universities and the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme).&nbsp;
What are the reasons for this abnormally high prevalence of depression
among the population of Gaza? The following statistics should give some
indication:</font><font color="#000000"></font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">17 per cent of adults had witnessed, before the
age of 12, the death of a family member and 35 per cent of them witnessed
the death of a family member after that age;</font>
<br><font color="#000000">7 per cent of them had witnessed clashes with
the army before the age of 12, and 32 per cent of them have witnessed such
events after the age of 12;</font>
<br><font color="#000000">19 per cent of the adult population has witnessed
the killing of a stranger,</font>
<br><font color="#000000">14 per cent have been tortured themselves (and
add to this the resulting effect on their families).</font><font color="#000000"></font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">And these individuals have experienced many other
dramatic events in their lives - these statistics are only given as examples
- in addition to having to get through their daily existence in an atmosphere
of prolonged tension and fear.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">These sorts of trauma are now occurring in Algeria
today on a massive scale.&nbsp; Children are witnessing killings, torture
and sustaining injuries to themselves and to their families.&nbsp; What
has led up to these events, and what will most likely follow them, is what
we call the 'cycle of violence'.&nbsp; For example, when a child is abused
by the father (who was probably, himself, mistreated as a child), he is
almost inevitably going to be an abuser in his adult life - unless this
kind of victimisation ends with him through treatment and therapy.&nbsp;
Why has this cycle of violence taken on such a dimension in Algeria? I
think it has a lot to do with colonisation.&nbsp; The French colonisation
of Algeria was so brutal and so inhuman that it left behind an enormous
amount of damage on the psyche of the Algerian individual, and on that
of the society as a whole.&nbsp; As a result, violence has become part
of the environment; after so much suffering at the brutal hands of French
colonialism, this pattern of behaviour has become ingrained in the society.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">We can see signs of the same phenomenon in Palestine
today.&nbsp; There is the widespread feeling that we are heading towards
a range of internal conflicts: tribal clashes, religious conflicts, clashes
between the people and the authorities, etc.&nbsp; Polarisation is also
developing in the political arena: we have an extremist Islamic group on
the one hand and, on the other, the Palestinian Authority that is so content
with having, and keeping, power.&nbsp; Thus, the potential for a range
of conflict exists.&nbsp; In Palestinian prisons (and I am glad to say
that this year we have witnessed less torture and fewer deaths in detention),
the brutality of the treatment is, at times, unbelievable.&nbsp; But why
all this brutality? Because the people meting out the torture were themselves
the victims of cruel and inhuman treatment at the hands of the Israeli
colonists.&nbsp; This ill-treatment has instilled a sense of inhumanity
in the former victims that allows them to become torturers in their own
right, to accept abuse as a normal form of human behaviour.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">Identification with one's aggressor is a common
pattern.&nbsp; Unconsciously the victim, when he subsequently finds himself
in a position of power, takes on the behaviour previously displayed by
his oppressor.&nbsp; I witnessed this phenomenon when I was in detention
myself: I could hear some Palestinians torturing other Palestinians, and
I was startled once to hear one of the interrogators shouting in Hebrew
to his victim.&nbsp; These men had, themselves, been tortured in Israeli
prisons and were now inflicting the same treatment on others.&nbsp; The
French colonisers' exploitation of Algeria was systematically inhuman in
the same way.&nbsp; The colonial ideology held that the native population
was subhuman, and should be treated in that way.&nbsp; Even now, long after
Algerian independence, I think that the majority of the French still look
down on the Algerians.&nbsp; And I think the majority of the Israelis -
even today when both Prime Minister Netanyahu and the progressive elements
in Israel talk about peace - do not see us as equal human beings.&nbsp;
The brutal treatment we have received at the hands of the Israelis is made
possible by their ideological concepts, which are similar to the racist
ideological concepts, which are similar to the racist ideology seen in
South Africa, where blacks were considered part of the animal kingdom,
like monkeys.&nbsp; Israeli scholars have even discovered that some Israeli
children believe that Palestinians have tails, and the Israeli chief of
staff Eytan once said publicly that Palestinians were like grasshoppers
and cockroaches and should be put in jars and smothered to death.&nbsp;
An Israeli mayor in a settlement said that Palestinians should not come
to the settlement, and if they did their shoulders should be stomped on
(this was a form of abuse used by Nazis on the Jews in concentration camps).&nbsp;
Identification with the aggressor, the perpetuation of the cycle of violence,
is clearly evident here.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">I think that many Jews, upon hearing of the maltreatment
of Palestinians, would have the impression that one is referring to the
Jewish victimisation of the past.&nbsp; Just as Palestinians, hearing of
the suffering of the Jews, would feel that it was their own suffering that
was being discussed.&nbsp; In so many ways, victims and aggressors are
only mirror images of each other.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">As Arabs, and as human beings, every heart in
our part of the world bleeds for Algeria today.&nbsp; But we are so helpless.&nbsp;
The magnitude of the suffering is too much for any of us to bear, and whatever
we can do will be only a tiny drop in a huge ocean.&nbsp; Especially when
we know that the junta in Algeria will be so resistant.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">It is time for us to prepare ourselves for different
possible scenarios, not only in Algeria, but also throughout the Arab world.&nbsp;
One of these possible scenarios is the outbreak of civil war.&nbsp; A second
is the rise of Islam leading to the Islamists coming into power, and this
is not so far from being realised.&nbsp; In that vein, we must face the
possibility that some Islamist regimes will be very radical and extremist,
and very oppressive.&nbsp; A third scenario, particular to Palestine, is
that we will invite the Israeli occupation back; or that one day Israel
will perhaps get tired of this peace process, will admit that it wants
land more than anything else, and so will invite itself back.&nbsp; Lastly,
there is the dim and very remote possibility that we will see the emergence
of a democratic Arab state.&nbsp; This idea is very distant and I do not
think it will come about soon.&nbsp; Perhaps within the twenty-first century?
For the time being, however, it seems that it is inevitable that conflicts
will arise in every Arab country.&nbsp; We can only hope that, in doing
all we can to help Algeria heal its wounds, we will see a new type of society
emerge from this ongoing conflict -a society where respect for human rights
will not come as an imposition from the West or from the elitist intellectuals
in the Arab world, but through the will and consent of the people themselves.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">We hope we will be able to transfer to the Algerians
what modest help we can from our experience in Gaza.&nbsp; We are sending
a psychiatrist in two weeks' time from Gaza Community Mental Health Programme,
as was requested by UNICEF, to train a group of Algerian psychologists
in counseling and therapy of traumatised children.&nbsp; Through arrangements
such as this we hope to train and to help as many people as possible.&nbsp;
However, the only way out of the Algerian crisis of violence is through
a democratic atmosphere.&nbsp; Though I am far removed from the reality
in Algeria, I have the impression that establishing such an atmosphere
will be very difficult, because of two serious forces standing in the way:
the extremists and the government.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">In the meantime, there is a growing population
of traumatised people in great need of support.&nbsp; Treatment is not
easy to carry out in an environment such as that of Algeria today.&nbsp;
One enormous problem we face when it comes to treatment of the victims
in this context is the general lack of trust gripping the population today;
it is not possible to carry out effective therapy when people are fearful
and suspicious.&nbsp; We tried group therapy in Gaza during the Intifada
uprising and it failed miserably.&nbsp; This was because everyone in the
group was suspicious of everyone else; they were afraid that some of the
other participants could be working for the Israelis as spies.&nbsp; I
am sure that in Algeria today many people are experiencing this type of
fear, will suspect others of being part of this or that dangerous element.&nbsp;
Thus, at this point anyway, group therapy would be difficult in Algeria.&nbsp;
Without an atmosphere of security and confidence, people cannot talk about
themselves, cannot discuss their traumas and their distress.&nbsp; And
where can you find such an atmosphere in Algeria? This is a very difficult
question.&nbsp; In Gaza we practised individual therapy and family therapy
at home, and still it took many weeks of sessions to gain the confidence
of the clients and their families.&nbsp; I do not know how easy this will
be in Algeria.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">The role of women is very important in the prevention
and treatment of trauma.&nbsp; From our experience in Gaza, we learned
that in order for a mother to best protect her child from lasting damage
she should not only be a warm and protective mother, but also a communicative
mother.&nbsp; This is to say that it is beneficial for the mother to communicate
openly with her child, to tell the child what is happening in social and
political life, what is happening in the neighbourhood, what is happening
everywhere - and, as best as she can, why it is happening.&nbsp; Thus,
to maintain an optimum sense of security in this type of insecure situation,
it is important for the child to have a mother who is both protective and
communicative.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">This brings us to the role, and experience, of
the father in these harsh circumstances.&nbsp; The father finds himself
in a particularly difficult position, as it is part of the Arab culture
that the men must be strong and in control, must never be seen as weak.&nbsp;
Asking for help is a sign of weakness.&nbsp; Arab men are generally very
resistant and possessive, considering women and children as part of their
property.&nbsp; Therefore they are very uncomfortable with the idea of
social workers or psychologists interfering with this 'property', and can
be very difficult to deal with.&nbsp; Similarly, policy makers, particularly
doctors in the health establishment, are also very resistant to this type
of mental health intervention.&nbsp; Even they, as health professionals,
usually consider psychology and psychiatry to be rubbish, nonsense, a waste
of time.&nbsp; Drugs, injections, hospitals and x-rays: these are the accepted
tools for medical treatment.&nbsp; Therefore, one will usually have serious
difficulties in convincing any Arab policy-maker of the value of the kind
of treatment we are discussing here, of quality mental health care.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">As mentioned, the ultimate hope, and what we should
strive for, is that the violence should end with the victim.&nbsp; We must
struggle to ensure that the victims of brutality receive the support, treatment
and education necessary to prevent the continuing spiral of aggression
and suffering.&nbsp; If violent behaviour does not end with the latest
victim, we are going to see repeated and never-ending cycles of violence
on the grounds of ethnic, tribal, or political affiliation, or whatever
the newest excuse may be.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
