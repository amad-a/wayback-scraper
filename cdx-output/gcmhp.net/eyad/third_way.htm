<ul>Scientists have proven that anxiety and depression can be causes of
death. They also confirmed that life expectancy in developed countries
is higher than in developing countries. For example, life expectancy in
Sweden is nearly eighty years, whereas it is much lower in this part of
the world.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Some primary causes of increased life expectancy include a balanced
system of nutrition, availability and high quality of medical services,
adequate exercise and a non-smoking environment. In addition, it has become
obvious that effectively coping with stress is another fundamental aspect
of this equation. As a result, interest in psychological problems and family
relations has increased, and mental health clinics have spread all over
the world. It is now normal in the United States, for example, to go to
one’s psychiatrist/therapist regularly, just as one would go to the dentist
or sports club.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>In our country, however, people still feel ashamed to talk about their
problems to a psychiatrist or other mental health professional; and people
continue to believe in spirits, possession and magic. I have seen the long
lines in front of the dens of fortune-tellers, amulet-makers and exorcists.
People turn to these individuals in times of national crisis, when feelings
of helplessness increase. However, the danger inherent in this phenomenon
is not difficult to discern: I saw with my own eyes the effects of barbaric
beatings at the hands of exorcists, which led to the death of an epileptic
girl and that of a girl suffering from hysterical paraplegia.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Nonetheless, given the current atmosphere of helplessness, of feelings
of surrender to fate in the face of Israel, of loss of faith in the Palestinian
Authority and in Arab regimes, it is not surprising that the number of
fortune-tellers and magicians in our midst is on the increase. Likewise,
the tribal mentality has taken hold of people, leading to a splintering
of society and leaving pessimism and anger as the only common denominators.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Thus, at a time when scientists are discovering the complexity of the
human brain and determining the different chemical processes that govern
human behavior, people in this part of the world are trying to avoid reality
and deal with their feelings of hopelessness and despair by turning to
voodoo and magic.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Modern science has proven that depression sometimes has chemical causes
due to the malfunctioning of certain chemicals secreted by the brain. This
malfunctioning leads to a disturbance in the electrical activity in the
brain, which in turn leads to deterioration in some cognitive and physical
functions. Another interesting discovery is that continuous stimulation
of the brain leads to the activation of idle brain cells and rejuvenates
brain activity.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>This finding encourages me to say that our stagnant political atmosphere
needs to be revived with new ideas. New blood needs to be pumped in so
as to stimulate the cells and brain.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The Palestinian political picture has two main colors: The Palestinian
Authority (PA) and the Islamists. While the PA is an authoritarian regime
holding the reigns of power and controlling the military and security machines,
the Islamists remain on the sidelines, out of their objection to Oslo and
its by-products. The Islamists have also suffered tremendous blows as a
result of the suicide operations, which were perceived as a declaration
of war on all parties. Thus, the PA has dominated the political arena and
has deprived it of any real debate between the political factions, at a
time when the Palestinian people most need such a debate.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The void on the political stage can be explained by many factors, one
of which is the communal state of shock felt at the collapse of the Palestinian
dream. This has led some to stay in the “trenches” and grasp the last thread
of fading hope. However, this vacuum in the political arena has become
dangerous, indicating a serious lack of popular influence in the decision-making
process.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>To overcome this problem, the Palestinian political environment requires
overwhelming changes bordering on a Cultural Revolution. Such a revolution
should be headed by a group of thinkers to bring to light a third way and
to reach out to the masses in Palestine and the Diaspora with a message
of civilization and development. We need a group of men and women who will
preserve the rights of the Palestinian people and who will offer a program
designed to stop the deterioration of our situation. We need a party that
will lead the people to a victory on the political level, will build a
democratic, civil society that respects the Law, and will strive to give
the Palestinian people freedom and dignity.
