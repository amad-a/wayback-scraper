<b><font color="#000066">“Truth is Best”</font></b></h3></center>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Mr. Fayez Abu Rahma has made the right
decision in resigning his post as Attorney General of the Palestinian Authority
(PA). Now, the question arises as to whether his successor will be willing
and able to fulfill the duties of this important post.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"></font></div>


<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">After months of reports about Mr. Abu
Rahma’s frustration at the continuous infringements on his duties and responsibilities,
news of his resignation did not come as a surprise. He tried to introduce
some changes by keeping a low profile and working patiently. Unfortunately,
because of the overwhelming pressure brought upon him, magnified by personal
and health reasons, he did not do all that we had hoped.</font>
</p><div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"></font></div>


<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Everybody realizes the importance of
the post of Attorney General. Under the Palestinian Authority, this post
has so far lacked a person with a strong-will and fearlessness in defending
public rights. In civilized countries, the Attorney General is the enemy
of injustice, the guardian against abuse of power and breaches of the law,
the helpless people’s shelter from the tyranny of the powerful.</font>
</p><div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"></font></div>


<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">We hope that the Palestinian Authority
will choose a suitable person as the Attorney General, a person different
from his predecessors. What the PA needs today are men and women who believe
in the rule of law and work towards establishing respect for the rights
of the Palestinian people.</font>
</p><div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Although the Palestinian experience
with self-rule is still new and is much better than in neighboring Arab
countries where people do not dare speak about human rights, the time is
ripe to end all human rights violations and to establish justice and the
rule of law.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"></font></div>


<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">At a time when we are still struggling
against the continuous, systematic violation of our human and political
rights by Israel, we should create an example of respect for human rights
in the Palestinian Areas. We should not put people in jail due to political
or ideological differences. We should not subject anyone to torture or
mistreatment under any circumstances. Detainees must enjoy the full rights
of attorney and visitation regardless of the charge against them. Suspects
must be brought in front of a judge to extend their remands or set them
free. And court decisions must be implemented.</font>
</p><div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The Attorney General heads the system
that oversees and controls all such matters. He cannot be the last to know
about abuses, as has been the case in the past.</font></div>
<font color="#000066"></font>

<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">We all want a strong authority to lead
us to safety in our struggle for freedom. However, the source of this strength
is a different matter. We call on the PA to reconsider this issue and to
draw its strength from the law by preserving people’s rights. The strength
of an authority does not come from the World Bank, which has recently stopped
all aid to the Palestinians pending the payment of taxes. Its power does
not come from a London conference and the whales’ struggle over security
and trade, even if such a conference results in Israel accepting a 13%
withdrawal from the West Bank and the ensuing false pretense that the Palestinians
have achieved a victory.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The real strength of the Palestinian
Authority is derived from the people, whether in support or opposition,
when all are equal under the law. It does not come from throwing accusations
through the media and questioning others’ patriotism and honor. The Authority’s
power derives from democratic dialogue with all sectors of the population
and their representatives in the Palestinian Legislative Council. That
Council suffered such a blow from the resignation of&nbsp; Dr. Haider Abdel</font>
</p><div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Shafi that other members are thinking
of doing the same. Still others think about forming an opposition bloc
due to the absence of effective opposition parties.</font></div>
<font color="#000066"></font>

<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Mr. Fayez Abu Rahma was sitting in the
crater of a volcano confronting one problem after another until he felt
that he was all alone. That’s when he resigned.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Waiting for the new Attorney General,
we hope to see someone armed with justice and strength prepared to overcome
the volcano.</font><font color="#000066"></font>
