<ul>New York is a city that never sleeps.&nbsp; It has everything that
other cities have to offer and more.&nbsp; It has culture, restaurants,
the United Nations, hundreds of statues, and tens of public parks, notably
the University park where a lot of people play chess.&nbsp; Also, New York
laws ban smoking in restaurants and public places despite the fact that
the US floods the world with tobacco and cigarettes.

<p>However, American coffee is weak and does not satisfy a Palestinian
from Gaza used to tens of thickly brewed Turkish coffee.&nbsp; I was glad
that New York offers a famous Italian treat, not the Mafia, but strong
Italian Coffee.

</p><p>On a beautiful morning, I sat in a cafe to read the newspapers.&nbsp;
I ordered expresso coffee; but the waiter brought me cappuccino instead.&nbsp;
My disappointment reminded me of the “cappuccino” in Palestinian courts.

</p><p>The case was that of a customer who was not satisfied with the cappuccino
he got in a local restaurant and sued them.&nbsp; The dispute between the
disgruntled customer and the restaurant took two years to resolve in Palestinian
courts, and cost the taxpayer a lot of money.

</p><p>I followed the “cappuccino case” with a few friends who still laugh
at the mention of it.&nbsp; I was amazed at how a dispute over a cup of
cappuccino could go through the Palestinian judicial system from the complaint,
to the different court processes, appeals, and ending with the verdict.&nbsp;
The “cappuccino case” was a great example of how citizens practice their
rights, and how the judiciary respects these rights.&nbsp; At the same
time, cases that greatly outweigh the importance of this one do not get
their due attention; and if a court issues an order in these cases, it
is not implemented.&nbsp; Moreover, judges are sometimes punished for issuing
a verdict in such cases.&nbsp; In addition, there are cases in which decisions
are interfered with.

</p><p>All of this is being done under strange and false justifications such
as pressures from Israel and the United States forcing the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) to detain people without trial, even if the High
Court and Attorney General order their release.&nbsp; Although we understand
the need to adhere to the Oslo Accords, which Israel is not too keen on
doing, it is not clear where in the Accord it is stated to disobey the
law and disregard court decisions.&nbsp; Another excuse for ignoring judicial
decisions is that the High Court, internationally known as the last resort
to enforce justice and give people their rights, “has no authority to take
such decisions”, as was stated by Brigadier Jabali.

</p><p>The critics of the PNA can only conclude that the PNA does not, in fact,
respect the “institution”, and considers any “institution” a threat.&nbsp;
This is enforced by the PNA’s frequent disregard of the courts or interfering
in their proceedings.&nbsp; This understanding is also affirmed by the
Authority’s negative attitude towards the Palestinian Legislative Council
(PLC).&nbsp; For example, the last episode between the PLC and the Authority
was over the vote of confidence.&nbsp; Although the Cabinet has the backing
of the vast majority of PLC members, the Executive Branch does not want
the Council to exercise its duties.&nbsp; It is thus clear that the Executive
Authority does not want an independent council, and wants to hold all the
reigns of power.

</p><p>Alas, all the talk about the Cabinet reshuffle will remain only hot
air regardless of how many ministers are changed.&nbsp; As long as the
PNA perceives the “institution” with suspicion and distrust, the Cabinet
reshuffle will only be like adding milk to the coffee we already know the
taste of.
