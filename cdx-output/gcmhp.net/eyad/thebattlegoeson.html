<p>Suddenly, it looked as if war had erupted and the PNA had decided to
destroy civil society and its community organisations, especially those
that deal with issues of human rights. Suddenly, voices from various media
platforms called for the destruction of these human rights organisations
and those who stand behind them. The voices accused human rights defenders
of involving themselves in politics, before turning round to the donors
and accusing them of wasting Palestinian public money by pouring huge resources
into these organisations. As things stand at the moment, the PNA is accusing
the human rights movement of deception and fraud!
</p><p>One gets the impression that the PNA has declared this war as part of
its national project to destroy the Israeli occupation, liberate the land,
by means of eradicating and silencing any opposition. This may be a hasty
evaluation of the PNA’s position, because everybody knows that it lacks
any effective vision, plan or administration. It is therefore hard to believe
that the PNA has come up with a plan specifically aimed at destroying NGOs.
Let us not forget that the PNA is made up of a group of individuals who
only meet, fleetingly, once a week and are hardly gifted at planning or
decision-making. Despite all this, there are people in the PNA who are
dissatisfied with NGOs in general and those that deal with human rights
in particular.
</p><p>The latest episode of this story began with the publication of the international
report, which alleged that the Palestinian judicial system and the ‘rule
of law’ were still very backwards, in spite of the money that has been
spent by donors on improving this condition. The Minister of Justice mistakenly
directed his riposte against human rights organisations, as though they
were the ones to have disregarded Palestinian High Court decisions, or
conducted arbitrary arrest campaigns, or tortured prisoners. Perhaps it
was the human rights organisations who called for the formation of the
State Security Courts which, ironically enough, the Justice Minister himself
described as being “like a play in which the accused is a character who
has not seen the events of the crime.”&nbsp; Perhaps the Minister believes
that HROs are the reason behind the PNA’s failure to appoint a Supreme
Judicial Council, an Attorney General or a Chief Justice, all of which
are necessary for the independence of the Judiciary and its separation
from the Executive Authority.
</p><p>Although a Chief Justice and an Attorney General have now been appointed,
due to public and international pressure, it would be wrong to think that
the judiciary has finally been respected. Far from it, the sweeping generalisations
made by the Minister about HROs has harmed the human rights movement and
opened the door to further attacks by mercenary writers who have no understanding
of patriotism. These writers, in their ‘defence of public funds’, have
done nothing but reiterate the same old accusations that they have been
making for the past five years. Despite the triviality of their accusations,
it is important to respond to them, and Dr Haidar Abd Ashafi, Raji Sourani,
Khader Shkierat and Iyad Sarraj have now filed a suit against the people
who made them.
</p><p>The real battle for building a civil society and a democratic state
based on the rule of law and the separation of the three authorities is
still in its opening stages. There is a very real danger of creating not
a democracy but a police state, inspired by false claims of a ‘struggle’
for which they never struggled by people who today claim ownership rights
to the homeland and the national project.
</p><p>I wish to confirm here that the battle is not between the public and
the PNA. There are some good people in the PNA, people who firmly believe
that the only way forward is to struggle for democracy and the rule of
law. This path, however, depends on public awareness of the truth.
</p><p>Let those who try to stand in its way know that the righteous voice
shall prevail, gain momentum and become victorious. The corrupt shall soon
be revealed, their documents, memories and statements disclosed. The corruption,
which has for so long been camouflaged in the name of the ‘struggle’, shall
be revealed. The true struggle shall be pronounced as separate from their
crimes, just as the real martyrs and their brethren still incarcerated
in prisons have nothing to do with their actions. Those who believe that
they will get away with their deception forever should realise that the
public is aware of their hidden agendas and dirty games. The public can
see their brand new cars, their priceless villas and apartments. The secret
bank accounts are coming to light.
</p><p>It seems ironic that the writers, in their criticism of HROs, chose
to completely ignore these facts in their talk about wasting public funds.
The public has long known that struggle is an honour that cannot be used
as a claim for protection. Let it be known that the NGOs’ success in laying
solid foundations for their establishments cannot be blamed for the failure
of those of the PNA. Instead of slinging blame, they should look at the
reasons for their failure. The Ministry of Justice should do the same,
and look at the reasons why the judiciary has so regressed. The Ministry
of Health does not claim that the deterioration of its services can be
blamed on the NGOs operating in this field.
</p><p>The basic issue is the great need to organise NGO affairs. The President
has still not endorsed the Law for this purpose, because he believes that
NGOs should be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior. This
challenges the will of Legislative Council members, who in their final
reading decided that NGOs should be kept under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Justice. This could have been resolved to the satisfaction
of all, had those who languish under the President’s protection not resorted
to using such aggressive tactics. A special ministerial committee was formed
to discuss the issue, confirming the need for the Law to be issued. We
took the appointment of the Minister for NGO affairs as a sign of good
intention, but it should not be used as a way to get around the issuance
of the above Law.
</p><p>Finally, NGOs should also learn a lesson from this episode. They, too,
must stand adamant in challenging corruption their institutions, respecting
the principles of transparency and accountability, adhering to the public,
identifying community needs and submitting to review of themselves, their
missions and their visions in order to remain successful. Most important
is that NGOs unite in the battle to consolidate democracy and the rule
of law.</p></ul>
