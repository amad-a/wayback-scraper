<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">As expected, the London peace conference
failed to resuscitate the moribund peace process. Likewise, conferences
in Cairo, Amman, Oslo, and Washington will fail. Things are crystal clear
now, and talking about the inflexibility of the Israeli government is time
wasting regurgitation; so is talking about American submission to Zionist
pressures, the weak European role, and hope in a strong Arab stance. Netanyahu’s
plan is to convince the world that his generous 9% pullback from bits and
pieces of the West Bank is the most any Israeli leader can do, so that
the world stops asking him for further withdrawals.</font></div>
<font color="#000066"></font>

<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">With the return home of the Palestinian
delegation carrying yet more disappointment and despair, we must do what
we have failed to do since signing the Oslo Accords: review the strategy
of Palestinian politics. In this respect, the Palestinian Authority needs
to confront serious questions, take a stance on a number of issues, solve
the sense of alienation that has plagued Palestinians in Palestine and
the Diaspora, and address why the world stands like a scarecrow in the
face of Israeli actions.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">How do we restore hope to the Palestinian
people? How do we make the rest of the world shift from being a mere bystander
to an active player?</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">My belief is firm in that change starts
from within, from Palestine, from the relationship between the people and
authority, and the respect for human rights, democracy, and the law. These
issues have an immediate impact on the credibility of the Palestinian Authority
inside and outside Palestine.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Palestinians in exile who contributed
money and time to the Intifada are now crippled because Oslo and its aftereffects
have marginalized their role. In addition, the reports of corruption and
mismanagement in the PA, the violations of citizens’ rights, and the ineffectiveness
of the Palestinian Legislative Council leave those Palestinians in a state
of confusion in the least. In reality the majority of Diaspora Palestinians
feel that their issue and cause have entered a dark maze with no guiding
light or hope.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The feelings of confusion and frustration
also torment the friends of the Palestinian people throughout the world,
as one sees when traveling from place to place. These feelings mingle with
the sense of powerlessness and paralysis, and everyone asks, “What are
we to do?”</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">For them, the picture changed after
Oslo, the establishment of the PA, the reports of disordered performance
and chaotic decision-making, the possibility of internal fighting, and
the PA’s disregard for the principles of democracy and human rights. Our
friends ask us, “How are we to stand by you and raise our voices for you
when you are such?”</font>
</p><div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"></font></div>


<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Moreover, the enemies of the Palestinian
people have increased their campaign to discredit the Palestinians and
showcase them as a people incapable of ruling themselves; and thus, justifying
the return of the occupation and its practices.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">This makes it mandatory for us to reconsider
our stance and come up with new ways of dealing with ourselves, Israel,
and the rest of the world.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">We saw some pro peace activists demonstrating
outside 10 Downing Street in London at the time of the London conference;
their number did not exceed thirty people. This number does not correspond
with the severity of the situation, the number of British friends of the
Palestinian people, or the morality of our cause. How would things be if
thousands of people demonstrated in London, Washington, European capitals,
and even Israel? What if these people marched the streets of their respective
cities, raising peace banners and calling for justice in Palestine?</font>
</p><div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"></font></div>


<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">If this were to happen, a popular movement
world-wide would arise and have an immense impact on political decision
making. It would be the best answer to the hollow rigidity and racism of
the Israeli Government. However, change will not and cannot begin except
from within Palestine with the people fully backing the Palestinian Authority,
which in turn respects human rights, democracy, and the law, and puts forth
an example of justice, equality, and credibility. Then the Palestinian
house will be in order, deriving its strength from all Palestinians, supporters
and opponents of the PA, all respecting the law. Only then will Palestinians
in exile regain their vigor and renew their commitment.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Indeed, the world will change when they
see us as a peaceful people struggling for our freedom and rights against
racism.</font>
