<ul>A shape voice screamed through the receiver warning all the “so-called”
human rights activists of devastation if they stand in the way of the security
branch that he works in. He did not mention my name. Nonetheless he pledged
to continue his work, and swore that none of those “collaborators” would
sway him from cleaning society from those sons of .... The tone of threats
and warnings rose despite my efforts to calm him down and find a common
language between us. When I asked him about the Law, he said that the law
is what he decides. When I mentioned the judiciary, he burst into a long
triad of curses on judges and courts.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>A moment of silence passed as sadness overcame me. The low ranking
officer broke the silence with a question, “Doctor, why do you align yourself
with that band of traitors and collaborators?” I was shocked by the question.
Human rights activists were the heroes that exposed Israeli brutality and
oppression. How did they suddenly become a band of traitors? I replied,
“Let us say that I am a doctor in a hospital and a group of people bring
me a sick Jew. Do I treat him or not?” The voice on the other end echoed,
“Of course you have to treat him; that is your duty.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Relieved by this answer, I pressed him, “Why not apply the same logic
to a prisoner who needs, and has the right to, someone to defend him until
a court decides his innocence or guilt?” I thought that I’d gotten my man
with this question; however, he retorted, “we are not in a hospital, and
I will not allow those traitors to live...” and he continued his curses.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>As the conversation ended, I regretted that we do not speak the same
language. We belong to different cultures, and the bridge between us is
too wide. The man is a master of force and domination; he has the guns,
troops, and detention centers. I have none of that. I only have a thought,
idea, or opinion.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The man lived his life, or most of it, in barracks and under the protection
of arms, which were the means communication and resolving disputes. He
could not overcome all of that and realize that the new era is that of
democracy, rule of law, peoples’ rights, and equality. He and others like
him are still hostage to the old days with the slogan of “rebellion till
victory”. He does not understand that today is the time of dialogue and
thought as a way to diagnose our problems and solve them.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The man is still living in the Beirut phase, in a trench separating
him from his enemies, and in fear of the conspiracy. He does not realize
that he is not in the midst of enemies, but between his family and friends
who share his dream of building a homeland and only want to be respected
human beings in their land. They do not want to be arrested for no reason,
tortured, and detained just to please Netanyahu and Albright. The man is
still haunted by the times when he was “wanted” by Israel and his life
was in danger. He has not yet realized that Israel is looking for and chasing
others and wants him to do that chore for her. Israel will use all methods
of dialogue, pressure, and blackmail to make of him a man who, directly
or indirectly, serves her purposes.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>I was sure that this man realized this fact; and I asked myself, “What
is happening in this country? Is not there any hope for intellect and politics,
democracy and security to meet? Is it impossible for a man to be respected
without having a gun slung over his shoulder? Are we on the verge of a
police state where we see no evil, hear no evil, and say nothing?”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>I tell this man that the big lesson comes from the former Soviet Union,
which was the second most powerful nation on earth. It melted like snow
in the sun because it was founded on dictatorship and brutality. I tell
this man to look around him in the dictatorial Arab world. People are dispirited
and their only ambition is to escape, even if to hell.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>I don’t know if, with all that happened and is happening, the day will
come when we stand opposite foreign embassies waiting for entry visas for
yet another exodus.
