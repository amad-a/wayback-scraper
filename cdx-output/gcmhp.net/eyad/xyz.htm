<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"><b><i>A few weeks ago</i></b> I said
that the struggle of Palestinians today is how not to become a bomb and
that the amazing thing is not the occurrence of the suicide bombing, rather
the rarity of them.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The BBC interviewer appeared to understand.
I was shocked because it is our understanding that the world out there
will never understand. And who on earth in their right mind would understand
terror and the killing of innocent people? Why do Palestinians kill themselves
and Israelis in such an horrific way at the bus stop or in a crowded market?
Do you really care to know? Well, let me try and explain.</font></div>


<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">I believe it is an act of absolute despair
and a very serious stage of the seemingly perpetual conflict. Since the
uprooting of the Palestinians in 1948 triggered by Irgun Jewish terror
under the leadership of Yitzak Shamir and Menachem Begin, we have tried
every thing. We have tried Nasser and Arab Nationalism, only to be invaded
in 1956 in our second homes in the refugee camps. It was only because of
the Russian threat to bomb London and Paris, and the resolve of American
president Eisenhower that ended the Israeli occupation.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">We have tried the United Nations and
its Security Council, which by the way have made excellent resolutions
on our behalf. For example Resolution 194 calling on Israel to allow us
to return to our homeland, but to no avail. So we kept wandering around,
between airports and refugee camps, waiting for a hero or an earthquake.
All we wanted was to go home. But our story was getting worse and we grew
bitter as we heard that a Jew from Poland would be declared a citizen of
our country - a country now called Israel. We were told that officially
we were stateless with undefined nationality. So we went to universities.
We believed then that Jews were so clever because they were educated. We
were told that Jews controlled the world with their education. They are
doctors, lawyers and scientists, never beggars or boxers. In twenty years
many of us became university graduates and we were in every university.
We had some pride. Some of our educated people formed the resistance movement.
They believed that the Arab countries would never fight Israel, and that
we had to force them to fight. Fatah with Yasser Arafat was born. They
forced the Arabs to fight by inviting Israel to attack Egypt in 1967. In
the course of six days the Arabs were defeated again but worse. This time
we lost Gaza and the West Bank, Egypt lost Sinai, and Syria lost the Golan.
In a sudden stroke our fate was sealed and we had to live under Israeli
military occupation for thirty years. Do you know what does it mean to
live under Israeli military occupation? Do you really care to know? Let
me tell you a few things.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">* You are given an identity number and
a permit to reside. If you leave the country for more that three years
in succession, you lose that right to residence.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">* When you leave the country on a trip,
you are given a laissez passez, a travelling document, valid for one year
and it tells you in its recording of your particulars that you are of undefined
nationality.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">* Israeli occupation means that you
are called twice a year by the intelligence for routine interrogation and
persuasion to work as an informer on your brothers and sisters. No one
is spared. If you are to be a member of a political organisation you will
be sentenced for ten years. For a military action you will be sentenced
to life.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">* To survive under the Israeli occupation
you are given the chance to work in the jobs that Israelis do not like,
sweeping the streets, building houses, collecting fruit or harvesting.
You will have to leave your home in the refugee camp in Gaza at 3 am, go
through the road blocks and check posts, spend your day under the sun and
surveillance returning home in the evening to collapse in bed for a few
hours before the following day.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">We simply became the slaves of our enemy.
We are building their homes on our villages, and we clean their streets.
Do you know what does it do to you when you have to be the slave of your
enemy in order to survive. No you will never know how painful it is unless
your country is occupied by another force. Only then will you learn how
to watch in silence pretending not to see the torture of your friends and
the humiliation of your father. Do you know what it means for a child to
see his father spat at and beaten before his eyes by an Israeli soldier?
Nobody knows what happened to our children. We don't know ourselves except
we observe that they lose respect for their fathers. So they, our children,
the children of the stone as they became known, tried the Intifada - the
Uprising. Seven long years our children were throwing stones and being
killed daily. Nearly all our young men were arrested, the majority were
tortured. All had to confess. The result was every one suspected that all
people were spies. So, we were exhausted, tormented and brutalised.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">What else could we do to return to our
home? We had almost forgotten that and all what we wanted was to be left
alone. What else could we try? Oh yes, peace. When the news came that Arafat
had signed a peace treaty in Washington we were jubilant. At last we thought
we were to get rid of that miserable life of military occupation, at last.
So we had hope.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">We could not believe our eyes when there
were no more curfews and we could actually spend our evening on the beach
or wander in streets which were now ours after eight o'clock at night.
We were ecstatic. We even had elections and we had a parliament, so we
were told. Then came Binyamin Netanyahu. He refused to meet Arafat and
was clearly forced to shake hands in obvious disgust. He refused to free
our prisoners, to have a safe passage for us to move between the West bank
and Gaza. He even surrounded our towns and villages with his tanks and
arrested our policemen. Then he went after our holy places and opened a
tunnel under our holiest Mosque. Tens of our children and also Israeli
soldiers were killed because of that tunnel, but he went on insulting us
and driving out our sanity. Arafat called for patience and we were patient,
then Netanyahu started to build settlements in Jerusalem and drive the
remaining Palestinians out. Settlers in Hebron spat on our prophet and
called him a pig. All in the name of peace we were humiliated, even arrested
and tortured by Palestinian forces to protect the peace. Our Authority
was turning against us to please Netanyahu. Our officials were driving
in big cars and building big villas. They have VIP cards and cross the
check posts like human beings while we are left to rot. I've told you a
few things. Now do you understand why we have turned into suicide killers?&nbsp;</font><br>
