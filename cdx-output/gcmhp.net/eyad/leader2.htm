<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"><b><i>The Notorious</i></b> decision
of mass deportation of the Hamas ideologues has uncovered curious and interesting
insight into the political complexities of the Palestinian Israeli conflict.
It has lead to a series of consequences; world uproar and condemnation
which damaged the Israeli image, increasing popularity of Hamas and the
halt on the peace talks.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">There is no doubt that this debacle
has seriously damaged Rabin's standing as a peace maker. Mr. Rabin who
has begun a process of rewriting the history when he ordered the breaking
bones of the Palestinian youth is</font>
</p><div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">writting a new chapter. The Jews are
not any more the eternal victims. Even Israelis began to wake up to the
naked truth.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">For Hamas and other extremists who
are born out of frustration; humiliation and despaire, Rabin's actions
are exactly fitting.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">He is the man who knows how to bring
more extremists out of the normal person.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Paradoxically but understandably,
however, Rabin is now at the mercy of Rantisi who can decide on the future
of the peace talks and may be the future of Rabin himself.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Rumours and reports are out on how
dictatorial Rabin treatment of his ministers, his mistrust and his inability
to judge and govern.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">From the outset. He has transmitted
conflicting massages. Advocating peace on his platform but presenting nothing
of substance on the negotiating table and even denying his team the needed
mandate. Declaring that there should be a political solution to the Intifada
and then exercising his iron fist and</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">its brute power which killed ten children
in the last six weeks.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Sadly, he and many Israelis are avoiding
the painful issues; a haracteristic of the repressed guilt.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">For a long time the Israelis were
denying even the existence of the Palestinians. The mental distance between
Tel Aviv and Gaza was more than a thousand miles. I think that they are
now begining to realise that the Palestinians exist, that they have a problem
and that the distance between Tel Aviv and Gaza is just 60 miles.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">In their preoccupation of their history
of victimisation the Israeli have forgotten about their own victims.</font></div>


<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">It is time that they do and for that
they need a leader.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">A strong man who does not need to show
his strength by brutality. Strong people do not need brute force, a wise
leader who can lead them through the path of peace and answer their painful
questions.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">A leader who will acknowledge that the
Palestinian painful journey into exile and oppression was caused by the
very establishment of Israel and that the West Bank and Gaza are occupied
territories.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">In return the Palestinians are ready
to acknowledge the right of Israel to exist and the right of Israel for
secure borders .</font>
