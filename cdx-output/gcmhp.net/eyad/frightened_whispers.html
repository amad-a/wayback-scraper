<p>She complained, "I took the test for a vacancy in an international organization
working with refugees, and got a high mark.&nbsp; A friend also took the
test and got the highest mark.&nbsp; However, we were surprised that the
vacancy was filled with the person who got the lowest marks on the test.&nbsp;
This was a result of this person being a relative of the person in charge
of the directorate in which the vacancy was available". She continued by
saying, "As you know, everything is done through connections nowadays.&nbsp;
Qualified hard-workers don't figure in this system."&nbsp; She ended her
plea by asking me to try to arrange for her employment anywhere because
of her dire financial situation, and because she is the provider for her
family.
</p><p>I asked her to submit an official complaint verifying her story in order
to intervene and see why the less qualified candidate filled the job vacancy
instead of her.&nbsp; When she heard this, she slumped saying, "But this
means that I will never be accepted for a job in the agency.&nbsp; Everyone
will stand against me if I submit a complaint."
</p><p>I felt sorry for her and the many people in our country who suffer from
injustice and corruption, while not daring to complain about it officially.&nbsp;
In a loud voice, I asked, "How can we straighten things out if everyone
were like you, fearing to complain and defend what is right? Why do we
blame the USA, Israel, PNA, and real estate brokers when we cannot defend
our rights in front of an administrator in the agency?" Angrily, I said,
"How can such a people rid itself of the occupation, restore the rule of
law, and declare a state?"&nbsp; And I remembered the tons of free advice
to stop the crazy onslaught of criticism.
</p><p>I calmed down and contemplated the situation of this person who cannot
bear the burden of her plight alone.&nbsp; How can I burden her with the
dilemma of the whole country?&nbsp; I felt that I was too harsh on her
and tried to apologize.&nbsp; However, tears rolled down her cheeks, and
she said, "You are right.&nbsp; We fear people when the only one we should
fear is God."
</p><p>I tried to calm her saying, "I understand your predicament and your
need for a source of income.&nbsp; I also understand your inability to
submit an official complaint in fear of further injustice, and do not want
to trouble you with things beyond you…" However, she interrupted me requesting
paper and a pen.&nbsp; She wrote a long letter of complaint about the international
agency, and signed it.
</p><p>I was happy for her and her courage.&nbsp; I felt the power of hope
in the people.
</p><p>The next day, she came back with three members of her family.&nbsp;
They wanted me to stop my role in the complaint.&nbsp; They also requested
that I give them the written statement.&nbsp; I could not convince them
of continuing with the complaint, and gave them the letter.
</p><p>This true story is one of hundreds of stories that I have come across,
and one of the thousands whose details I do not know.&nbsp; It embodies
the overwhelming atmosphere of depression, fear, and tendency towards hypocrisy
and lies.&nbsp; These diseases are spreading in this society, which was
once the regional front-runner for the democratic experience and building
a state that respects justice and the law.&nbsp; Nonetheless, there are
hundreds of complaints signed by their writers without fear or hesitation.&nbsp;
None have given them justice however; and when they went to the High Court,
the decisions were not implemented.
</p><p>How long will this situation continue? Or will the saying of the Prophet
(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) come about, "If you see the
aggressor and do not stop him, Allah is about to punish you".
