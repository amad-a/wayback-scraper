<ul>Nothing in this strange world surprises us anymore. That is why people
smiled in mockery as they listened to the representative of the Attorney
General testifying that, after 50 days of the arrest, the AG knew nothing
about of Dr. Abdel Aziz El-Rantisi’s detention (refer to the press release
of the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, 27 May 1998).

<p>Mr. Fayez Abu Rahma did not surprise us when he resigned from the post
of AG.&nbsp; We expected him to resign earlier because he is a man of the
law who upholds the principles of justice, and will try to implement his
beliefs.&nbsp; In addition, we knew that he was chasing a mirage.

</p><p>We were not surprised at the arrest of some detainees one hour after
releasing them.&nbsp; Forcing Chief Justice Kosay El-Abadlah into retirement
a few weeks ago did not surprise us, nor did compelling High Court Judge
Abdel Fattah of Ramallah to retire after deciding to release some Birzeit
students.

</p><p>However, what surprises us is the simplicity with which the representative
of the AG testifies bitter truth about how we live in a time lacking respecting
the judicial system and its decisions.&nbsp; This testimony was like making
a factual statement about a normal thing of everyday life to which the
people have become accustomed.

</p><p>In reality, the testimony presented by the representative of the AG
is a rebellion against the Arab norms of total submission to the establishment
as in the famous Chinese proverb, “no hear, no listen, no speak”.&nbsp;
In this case, the person spoke the untold truth.

</p><p>This testimony expresses the utter humiliation felt by people working
in the judicial system.&nbsp; This representative is testifying that the
AG is like the wronged husband, the last to know.&nbsp; He cannot defend
people because he does not know why they were detained.&nbsp; He does not
know why they are prevented visitation rights, why they are not put in
front of a judge within 24 hours, etc…

</p><p>In the end, it seems that the last to know is not the wronged husband
or the Attorney General, but the Law itself…
