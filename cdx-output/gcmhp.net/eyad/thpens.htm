<ul>I have an old friend who returned to his homeland full of passion and
excitement after a long exile abroad.&nbsp; Perhaps allowing some refugees
to return home was the most important accomplishment of the Olso Agreement.

<p>This friend of mine had been living in London. Despite his luxurious
life, his British Passport, and his many successful businesses, including
a major publishing house, he always dreamt of returning to Palestine.&nbsp;
He adores our country and has always considered Gaza as his first home.

</p><p>My friend has told me many stories about life in exile since his departure
from Gaza many years ago. One of the most interesting and meaningful stories
that he told me was about his desire to publish an Arabic magazine in London.&nbsp;
After seriously considering this idea, he phoned the Ministry of the Interior
to inquire about the possibility of obtaining a permit to publish the magazine.&nbsp;
The Ministry employee replied that his Ministry did not give permits for
magazines and newspapers.

</p><p>My friend was at loss or that perhaps-even England was like the Arab,
where to go in a place, not like the Arab World, that has no ministry of
information, indeed miss-information.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>He decided to call the Ministry of Trade &amp; Commerce, hoping to
obtain a permit.&nbsp; Due to the commercial nature of magazines, he thought,
the Ministry must have a specialized department for publications.&nbsp;
Once again, however, he was told that the Ministry does not issue permits
for magazines.

</p><p>Thoroughly confused and frustrated, my friend eventually consulted a
lawyer on the issue.

</p><p>The lawyer was surprised by the request and told my friend, with a slight
degree of humor, that there was no need for a permit and that anyone could
publish anything that he wanted - books, magazines, or newspapers.

</p><p>My friend told me this story when I asked him to publish an Arabic periodical
about democratic awareness.&nbsp; He explained to me in diplomatic terms
that we would need to obtain a permit!&nbsp; We would have to present our
periodical to a censor, in accordance with the law of publication which
was gives passed by the PA prior to the election and the ministry of information
much power and leverage.

</p><p>Few weeks ago, I have read a statement by the Palestinian Attorney General
before his resignation in which he said that we are living in the shadow
of the Emergency Laws issued by the British Mandatory power which has introduced
the law in order to repress the Palestinian resistance.&nbsp; I could not
believe it.&nbsp; These laws restrict freedom, forbid democracy, and destroy
creativity and originality.&nbsp; I then looked back to the Palestinian
Declaration of Independence, where I found many passages emphasizing the
rule of law and respect for human rights and freedom of expressions.&nbsp;
In addition, I examined the Basic Law, passed by the Legislative Council
but still await the daylight.

</p><p>Unfortunately, many intellectuals and writers prefer to be safe, or
they think so, by specializing in Israeli or Mao Mao affairs – issues that
are comfortable and free from possible confrontation.

</p><p>The result is that in Palestine today we either have thoughts without
writers or writers without thoughts.

</p><p>This is a clear shortcoming that we must address.&nbsp; Accepting this
situation through ‘nonalignment’ stands is a direct opposition to the principles
of democracy.&nbsp; The Legislative Council must take a bold step and cancel
the Printing and Publications Law.&nbsp; At the same time, free writers
must defend their rights as expressed in the Palestinian Declaration of
Independence and in all international declarations of basic human rights.
