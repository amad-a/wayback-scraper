<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">In his usual simple and direct manner,
<b><a href="/gcmhp.net/haider.htm" style="">Dr. Haider Abdel Shafi</a></b>
put forth his thoughts on the demise of the peace process in a long article
published on 31 March 1998 in Al-Quds newspaper. He laid the blame for
the failure of the peace process on the Israeli Government and American
bias. He ended the article attempting to answer the long-standing question
of “What to do?” by pointing out the Palestinian strategies on the local,
Arab, and international arenas. I do not think that many would differ with
what Dr. Abdel Shafi wrote. If the question of what to do was easy to answer,
the question of how to do it remains.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">How can we strengthen national unity?
How can we revive Arab solidarity? How can we change the American and European
positions? I expect Abdel Shafi to say that if each and every one of us
performed his duties morally and professionally, we can then start our
march towards liberation.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">What Dr. Abdel Shafi did not point to
is the clear Palestinian Authority’s failure to move on the internal and
external tracks. The Palestinian Authority’s failures are evident through
the prevalent chaos and violations, the lack of accountability, the absence
of good role models, and oppression of freedom of speech. Dr. Abdel Shafi
did not mention the deep disappointment and frustration spread among us
like a famine, and the nostalgic and vengeful thoughts occupying people’s
minds as a result of the splitting of society into “the rich and powerful
new elite” and “the rest of us”.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Dr. Abdel Shafi did not touch on how
the Palestinian Diaspora feels irrelevant and marginalized as a result
of the Oslo Accords, which limited the Palestinian question to Gaza and
the West Bank.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Dr. Abdel Shafi overlooked the collapse
of the PLO that was representing the Palestinian movement. Moreover, he
failed to mention the different Palestinian and Islamic organizations that
stand against the current peace process, and did not refer to the role
of these parties, some of which have evaporated or are idle, with a portion
of their leadership languishing behind Palestinian bars. Also, what of
the national unity negotiations? Or, was that another “show”?</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Dr. Abdel Shafi did not answer how we
can consolidate Arab unity knowing Arab regimes’ submission to American
influence, despite the arrogant proclamations of some Arab foreign ministers
of Arab independence of will.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">We cannot and do not expect Dr. Abdel
Shafi to answer all these points. The responsibility for that is a collective
Palestinian one that requires intellectuals and politicians to start a
serious and effective dialogue. However, the historical problem remains;
are people prepared to cross the barrier of fear, and are the regimes ready
to accept freedom of speech and opinions? We do not doubt the near impossibility
of this, which will hasten the confrontation between the democratic forces
and the governments.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The Palestinian dilemma and Palestinian
rights have been abused by the ruling regimes to rise to power and preserve
their stranglehold of the people in league with the colonial powers, whose
sole concern is the preservation of the status quo regardless of democracy
and human rights. While these regimes try to occupy the people with television
shows and opening new free trade zones, free thinkers lie in prisons.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The Zionist conspiracy on Palestine
in alliance with the Anglo-Saxon league of the USA and Britain is powerful
in its control of world media and manipulation of voters. In addition,
it influences the European economy and uses the guilt complex of the holocaust
and the fear of being labeled “anti-Semite”. Although we rightfully blame
the United States and Britain for the catastrophes that befell the Palestinian
people from the uprooting in ’48 till Oslo, we still insist that the main
responsibility to change remains ours. We only need to look at the South
African example of how the forces of freedom and democracy remained faithful
to their principles, and eventually forced their will on the imperial and
racist powers. They recruited world opinion and forced governments to boycott
apartheid in South Africa until the regime crumbled, and Mandela marched
from his prison cell to the presidential palace in triumph.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">In Palestine however, the picture looks
bleak and explosive with threatening internal violence and against Israel,
as pain and anger have saturated the atmosphere. Netanyahu will understand
that he was gambling with the lives of Jews when he was trying to strangle
the Palestinian people into submission, humiliate them, and draw relief
from their suffering. The Palestinian Authority will understand, and maybe
when it is too late, that we were all hostages in the name of peace.</font><br>
