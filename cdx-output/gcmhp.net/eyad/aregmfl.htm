<ul>Airports symbolize travel and invoke nostalgic feelings and longing
for family and friends.&nbsp; They also represent renewal and exploring
the unknown.&nbsp; I’m still amazed at an airplane’s ability to fly and
how mankind has broken the secrets of avionics to dominate the world.

<p>Finally the plane landed in Berlin, the rejuvenated German capital recovering
its glory after years of being a divided city.&nbsp; The Berlin wall was
a harsh symbol that makes one wonder how it ever fallen and disappeared.&nbsp;
How did the German masses from both sides of the wall finally met with
the whole world watching and listening to the songs of peace and freedom?&nbsp;
At the time, the world had a lot of hope for freedom.

</p><p>I pictured Gorbachev as I walked Berlin’s main street where the famous
Brandenberg Gate between East and West Berlin stands.&nbsp; He lit the
first candle that illuminated Moscow, signaling the downfall of barriers
and end of the old decadent regimes.

</p><p>I remember how the Arab world was amazed as they witnessed Chauchesco
topple down from his throne after decades of iron fist rule in Romania.&nbsp;
In his last few days, he vainly tried to escape the wrath of the people
who drank from his bitter cup of oppression.&nbsp; This was the course
and end of the East European, revolutionary communist regimes.&nbsp; These
Leninist, Stalinist revolutionaries grabbed power and forced a one-party
system, while ruthlessly eradicating opposition, for the greater good of
the people!

</p><p>For the world to be a better place, communists grabbed power at whatever
cost under the auspices of a Proletariat rule and considered opposition
to communism enemies of the revolution that must be removed.&nbsp; The
result was torture, murder, imprisonment, and uprooting in the name of
the people and protecting the revolution.

</p><p>Lenin’s philosophy of oppression was the first nail in the coffin of
Communism and Marxism, which analyzed social structure and conflicts and
called for eliminating all forms of oppression and build a democratic socialist
society.

</p><p>Unfortunately, Leninist thought spread quickly in developing countries
suffering from the effects of colonialism, ignorance, and poverty.&nbsp;
In such countries, those who called themselves revolutionaries believed
that they were the elite leadership for their people.&nbsp; They had no
doubt that they have a historic responsibility to take the shortest route
to power, by coup or armed struggle.

</p><p>Thus, revolutions and coups engulfed the Arab world, Africa, and Latin
America in the name of freeing the people.&nbsp; Governments that squander
resources and enslave the people ruled many countries.&nbsp; Power was
in the hands of officers and uncrowned kings not better than colonialists
or their puppet regimes in thinking that the land and people are their
private possessions.&nbsp; They degraded the people, spread corruption
through their perverse governing, and forced the mind and will of the people
in submission.&nbsp; These regimes were outstanding in using the slogans
of liberating Palestine and the struggle against colonialism as a justification
to continue their autocracy.

</p><p>As I walked the Berlin’s main street, I could not help but ask myself,
“how strange is it for dictatorships to tumble under popular democratic
uprisings in many parts of the world, while the regimes stand defiant and
strong in our Arab world?”

</p><p>It is clear that the peaceful, unarmed, and yet determined masses in
the streets requesting their right to human dignity and to participate
in the decision making process is the way to bring down these regimes.&nbsp;
This is why Iran’s Shah ran away, Chauchesco tried to run away before getting
killed, Marcos fled, and the Berlin wall went down.&nbsp; It will also
be the way Soharto is brought down in Indonesia.

</p><p>It seems that the deep belief in the role of the people has not infected
the Arab world.&nbsp; The exception to this is the Palestinian Intifada
in its first few years when it was a spontaneous popular uprising against
the Israeli occupation.&nbsp; The Intifada remains as an example of how
people can go out in the streets and demand their rights.&nbsp; There was
trace of an intifada in Egypt when workers took to the streets demand their
rights inciting Sadat to call it “the uprising of the thieves”.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
the majority of the Arab world lives hostage to the police state that succeeded
in oppressing opposition or forcing it in submission while spreading a
atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.

</p><p>Will the day come for the Arab masses to go out in the streets and start
an Intifada against the decadent regimes, forcing their symbols to flee
or commit suicide?&nbsp; Will Lenin finally die in our Arab world?

</p><p>I know that this day is not distant.
