<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Despite her mother’s tearful persuasion
to sleep beside her sisters in the tent, Dalal insisted on sleeping in
her bed in the demolished house. She snuggled under the covers and dropped
off to sleep as the sound of her mother’s voice told her a bedtime story
of a hero fighting evil. The mother called her husband who carried their
daughter to the tent.</font></div>
<font color="#000066"></font>

<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Dalal was not the only heartbroken child
that night. In February 1993, the Israelis destroyed a whole block in El-Amal
neighborhood in Khan Younis. They claimed to be looking for a terrorist.
The army issued warnings to the residents then bombarded their homes with
explosives and rockets leaving behind the rubble of twenty demolished houses.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Our hearts filled with anger as we walked
through the remnants of the disaster. I stopped as I listened to a woman
saying, “This is the third time. They destroyed our houses in ’48, then
they destroyed our house in the refugee camp, and this is the third time.
We have spent our lives dreaming of a place to call home; and when we built
one, they destroyed it.” I looked around me and saw that tears filled my
companions’ eyes; some lowered their heads stung by the pain visible in
the woman’s face.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Peace activists from many parts of the
world were with me. That day, they realized that Israel’s policy of uprooting,
destruction, and military occupation stripped from it all morality. One
said, “If what I see before me represents Judaism, then I’m ashamed to
be a Jew. I had never thought that the Jewish people who suffered tyranny
and death in Europe would victimize the Palestinians to the same effect.”</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">My friend also talked of how great the
Intifada had been in exposing Israel to the world as a nation founded on
violence and uprooting, a nation adamant in expelling Palestinians despite
their proclamations of peace and co-existence. The peace that Israel wants
is for all Palestinians to leave all of Palestine in peace.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Since its establishment, Israel has
been lying to the Jewish people and the world. This is what Smiha Flappan
of Mapam stated in his book, “Truth and Myth in the Establishment of Israel”.
He explained Ben Gurion’s point of view for accepting the UN Partition
Plan: “we accept the Partition Plan as a first step towards taking all
the land; for now, let the Arabs reject the Partition”.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Following Flappan, Israeli historian
Benny Morris used Israeli army documents to prove how Zionist militias
wiped out hundreds of Palestinian villages. In addition, renowned author
Israel Shahak exposed the racism in Judaism and in the state of Israel,
which the Zionist propaganda tried to hide during the past fifty years.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">And so, Israel celebrates its fiftieth
birthday with the illusion that, as was the promise of Zionism, they have
laid the solid foundation for a state that will protect Jews from racism.
In reality, Jews from all over Europe came to make Palestine yet another
ghetto inflamed in violence, death, and destruction.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">With the ecstasy of forming the Jewish
State, the pioneers of this venture disregarded the rights of the inhabitants
of the land and their history. With the Intifada, the truth became candid
to the world as to the real victim in the Arab-Israeli conflict; and as
the Arabic saying goes, “Lies are short-lived”.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">And now Netanyahu, a new pioneer, turns
his back to the whole world calling for peace. His manner calls up images
of apartheid South Africa before it finally collapsed.</font><font color="#000066"></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">In this deep crisis, I am hopeful and
optimistic. My feelings are not sentimental, but a meditation over the
developments of the past 50 years. From under the rubble, the Palestinian
people will rise and build their home full of love and peace just like
Dalal built a new house where her tent used to be.</font>
