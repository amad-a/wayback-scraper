<ul>I was impressed by Abu Ali Shahien’s stance in face of the bullying
tactics exhibited by settlers. And Shahien was not the only one to stand
up to Israeli aggression, the world saw the Minister of Higher Education,
Hanan Ashrawi, and Head of the Orient House, Faisal El-Husseini lead protests.
We saw Israeli soldiers beat up Finance Minister, Zuhdi El-Nashashibi,
despite his old age.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>These are clear signs indicating Ministers’ identification with the
people’s struggle for freedom. These Ministers, and many of their colleagues,
have a long history of resisting Israeli injustice and aggression.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The Palestinian individual, whether a regular citizen or a Minister,
must fight two battles simultaneously: the battle for freedom and regaining
the land, and the battle to rebuild the homeland. In addition, ministers
are evaluated by their performance in their respective ministries, and
we know of many who work hard and dedicate much time and effort to developing
their society and to serving citizens to the best of their ability.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>An example is the Ministry of Education. Despite the poor conduct in
dealing with striking teachers, the Ministry has employed specialized professionals
to upgrade and improve the Ministry; and we are anxiously waiting to see
how these professionals will implement the curriculum design plan of Dr.
Ibrahim Abu El-Lughod.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Other such examples include the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry
of Commerce, and the Ministry of Housing. And these examples should not
be taken as a detraction from the efforts of other ministers who are working
very hard, despite all of the talk about the Cabinet reshuffle (and despite
having their resignation accepted by the President!).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>However, regardless of the reshuffle and all that the ministries accomplish,
ministers remain a topic of gossip and jokes. There is public outcry over
the deterioration in services, increasing bureaucracy, low salaries, conflicting
tasks and responsibilities, internal power struggles, lack of planning,
ministers who spend long tours abroad, random employment without qualifications
and nepotism. These issues are what thousands of patients, government workers,
teachers, engineers, physicians, soldiers, and civil workers are complaining
about. How can this be when we have some excellent examples of credible
ministers?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>In my opinion, the problem is not that of a minister or a ministry,
and it will not be solved if the cabinet is reshuffled once or ten times.
The dilemma is that the Authority lacks a system respected by all, a system
that respects the people and adheres to the Law, one that ensures equality
and justice.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The ministers suffer from insufficient transparency and openness in
the system; and the Cabinet lacks a sense of teamwork in carrying out the
responsibilities of the Authority. The Cabinet is not a ticket to sit in
elaborate meetings, ride around in luxury cars, and breeze through checkpoints
with VIP passes which, incidentally, are not always respected -- just like
ministerial decisions.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>It is not only the Cabinet that is plagued with inefficiency. The Palestinian
court system is constantly humiliated for not implementing court rulings;
and the Palestinian Legislative Council still regurgitates hollow promises
made by the executive branch. The Council now is a hopeless structure.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The principal issue at hand is the violation of the sanctity of the
individual and the institution, through the lack of an order based on the
separation of powers, democracy, and respect of the Law. This problem endangers
all national institutions, and simply changing some ministers will not
solve it.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>If I were a minister, I would ask myself where the Cabinet stands on
the issues of breaching high court decisions, of human rights violations
by security branches, of fighting corruption, of resolving the administrative
chaos, and other pressing problems. These questions require the ministers
to take a stance similar to the one that Shahien took in face Israeli aggression.
In essence, it is all one battle that starts from within.
