</p><div dir="LTR"><b><i><font color="#000066">Palestinian Minister of Health</font></i></b></div>
<font color="#000066">&nbsp;</font>

<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">In the Name of Allah,</font>
</p><div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Thanks to Allah,</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Ladies and gentlemen, participants
of this great international conference, honored guests of the Palestinian
people.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">First of all, allow me to thank you
on behalf of the Palestinian people and the thousands of health workers.
We greatly value your presence here to hold this important conference in
Gaza. The usual impression that forms when Gaza is mentioned elsewhere
is that of barbed wires and explosions. Despite this, you have come here
out of courage and faith. Therefore, welcome.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">This conference is a significant turning
point and a bright chapter not only in the history of the Palestinian people,
but also in the history of human rights, and the enlisting doctors worldwide
for the promotion of human rights.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Ladies and gentlemen, you are right
to be proud of what you have achieved during the last few days and should
be proud of what you do as activists. The noble message you carry, the
message for the sake of which you bear the wrath of governments and rulers,
people in power and their worshipers. Despite that, you persist in carrying
the message with dedication and selflessness. You are the messengers of
this age.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">During the darkest ages throughout
history, the Heavens have sent earth messengers of kindness carrying Allah's
word to humanity. Now that these messengers are no longer sent, Allah has
instilled kindness in people, men and women walking on earth and implementing
Allah's will in preserving his creation, the human being.</font></div>


<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">In all religions and with all messengers,
Allah ordered human beings to preserve fellow humans' lives, property,
and dignity; ordered the strong not to do injustice to the weak; ordered
the people in power not to oppress their people.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">From Islam, I quote Prophet Mohammad's
(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saying: "The master of martyrs
is Hamza, and a man who stands up to an unjust ruler and advises him what
to do or not do, and is killed for that."</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The message that you carry makes you
extraordinary people. We have learned a lot from you. We have discovered
the importance of things that we took for granted. The number of doctor,
nurses, and health professionals advocating human rights are very few.
We have just discovered this truth because we were busy trying to provide
penicillin and aspirin to children and getting antibiotics through Erez
to ensure that vaccinations are not stopped. We have had to make sure that
our hospitals have bread.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">I have discovered that before "Physicians
for Human Rights" came along, we as doctors and nurses did not ask ourselves
what the Medical Association could do to increase human rights awareness
and enlist volunteers. I am certain that after this conference we will
start to do so. God willing, next conference we will present you with a
human rights record that we and you can be proud of.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">I think that if we had ten people like
Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj and Husam El-Nounou..., no, let us be modest, if we
only had three more, our doctors would better value human rights and take
more steps to preserve them. They would be stopping torture and confronting
it strongly and selflessly.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Ladies and gentlemen, today, the Palestinian
National Authority is paying a high price for not implementing Netanyahu's,
and strangely enough Albright's, conception of security coordination and
the American-Israeli understanding of security.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">This concept is that of lists of orders:
the first list had 85 names of people to be handed over to Israel, the
second one had 170 names, the third had 130, and the fourth list was of
organizations to be closed, like Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other supporting
organizations like them.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">They say that the Palestinian Authority
has a revolving door policy of arresting people and releasing them. They
want us to hand people over to them. When we say no, they pressure us.
We are implementing Palestinian law in which arrests are based on reasonable
charges. Instead they pressure us on the following issues:</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">1. In December 95 and January 96 in
Paris, the donor countries committed themselves to giving to the Palestinian
Authority 880 million US dollars. What we actually received was 110 million.
What happens to all our plans for the health, education, and infrastructure
sectors which were laid out in Paris?</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">2. The last closure lasted 70 days.
I do not need to explain the effects of the closure since this was covered
in the workshops of the conference. The closure deprived 120,000 laborers
and their families of their livelihood.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">3. In an unprecedented gesture in the
history of the Palestinian people and in dealings between states, Israel
withheld Palestinian Authority money used to cover salaries and the running
expenses of hospitals and schools. This was done days before the beginning
of the scholastic year.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">4. The American Government did not submit
a routine, quarterly bill to Congress permitting the PLO diplomatic mission
in Washington DC to operate. Congress then went into recess and the presence
of the PLO representative in Washington, all of a sudden, became illegal.
After negotiations, he was allowed to stay, but barred from entering the
State Department or taking part in any negotiating team or delegation that
meets with American officials.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">5. The US Congress did not approve a
grant to<b> </b>the Palestinian Authority which was previously promised
to them. This grant was withheld awaiting an American official's certification
that the Palestinian Authority has agreed to security cooperation according
to the Israeli concept.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Despite the continuing suffering and
deadlock in peace, all Albright talks about are security demands that have
to be met by the Palestinian Authority. If these demands are met, Netanyahu
will release the money and the diplomatic mission in Washington DC will
be allowed to operate. But there will be no mention of the starving 120,000
laborers and 85,000 civil employees or the paralysis of the activities
of Ministries.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Over the past few months, I have forgotten
that I am a minister of health who should think of developing the health
sector. I had to receive a long line of people: the contractor who supplies
bread wants his money, the contractor who supplies food wants his money,
the contractors who supply medication want their money, etc. They all ask
me, "How do you expect us to keep supplying you if you do not pay?"</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Friends, I am not trying to get you
to support an authority in Palestine or elsewhere, if it does not respect
human rights. I am trying to put the whole picture in front of you so that
all of us can wonder how the super power leading this world can have such
a double standard on human rights.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Friends, I know that you are exhausted,
but I have a message from my mother that I must deliver. I will have to
go back and see her after I leave you.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">My mother, Um Saleem, is 89 years old.
She tells me that she does not believe that I am a minister or someone
that important because she sees my life and happiness deteriorating. She
also said that she tested me when she asked to pray in Jerusalem with Um
Hannah, our Christian neighbor. My mother wanted to pray in Al-Aqsa Mosque
and Um Hannah in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. I told her that I could
not get permits for them because the Israelis cited security reasons. Two
days later I got the permits because the employee who informed me of the
rejection saw my sadness and filed new applications under the excuse of
going to St. John's Hospital in Jerusalem for eye examinations. My mother
refused to lie in order to pray, and Um Hannah refused to lie in order
to pray.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">My mother has told me, "Tell your friends
that I am like them, a human rights activist. I have been ridiculed by
my grandchildren because I cry twice when I watch TV. When Palestinians
are killed, as in Al-Aqsa and Hebron, I cry. When Israelis are killed,
as in Mahne Yehuda and Lebanon, I cry. My grandchildren ridicule me and
think that I cannot tell the differenbetween Palestinians and Jews.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">I cry when Israelis die because they
also have mothers who are saddened. I cry twice and say to both sides:
'enough death, enough destruction, enough blood for 50 years. Is it not
time to respect God's creation and stop killing? Reach a compromise and
live together'".</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">When my mother asked me about this conference,
I had a hard time trying to explain human rights to her. I simplified it
by telling her that these people are like you: "If an Israeli is killed,
they cry; if a Palestinian is killed, they cry; if peace is achieved, they
rejoice; if a human being is respected, not detained or tortured, they
are happy; and if a human being is detained and tortured, they are angry.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">"Promise me," she said, "that you will
tell them that Um Saleem is with them".</font>
