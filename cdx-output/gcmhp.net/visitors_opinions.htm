<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000099">I have been to tens of conferences
of all sizes all over the world, and everytime I come back, I am almost
ill. My daughter says to me, "Mom, why do you do this to yourself? Why
don’t you take a cruise and see nice places instead?" Nevertheless, I go
out of principle. Sometimes I foresee the results. I know what is going
to happen before it does. It is like the elections: you know who is going
to win.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000099">This conference is the only one I
have been to recently about which I felt enthused. The people were genuine,
spontaneous. They were so generous and loving! Mind you, I come from a
very dry environment. I come from England where every person is like a
cactus in its own wilderness. Each human being is left on his own.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000099">Another thing is that -- perhaps I
saw it many years ago in Mozambique, Algeria, and Zimbabwe -- people on
the morning of independence, the eve of independence, tend to be romantic,
idealistic, and full of hope. They have the capacity to hope. I also saw
how it is possible with people who are committed and selfless to do things
or try to achieve things. I am happy to have made it this time. I promised
myself to come and ask you to give me a Palestinian nationality so I could
spend the rest of my life in Gaza. I have been in transit for the last
25 years. I do not want to die in England. Here I have my friends whom
I do not see or hear from very often, though we remain friends. You are
extraordinary. You remain yourself in a world that erodes you and erodes
the hope in your heart. It is something fantastic. It really gladdens my
heart. I have to come back again. I feel like I am home. Thank you.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000099"><font size="+1">Dr. Freddy Reddy:</font></font></b></div>

<div dir="LTR"><i><font color="#000099">Psychiatrist, Norway</font></i></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000099">The first time I was inspired to think
of Palestine was in Shatilla, in Beirut, in 1982. I met a Palestinian doctor
who was about 60. I asked him why he was in Beirut, what had made him come.
He said he was an Arab doctor in Tel Aviv, and as an Arab doctor, he would
bring things to be recognized by the Israelis, and in this way, he forgot
his identity. In addition, it suddenly occurred to him that the Palestinian
people were more important to him than his identity. They were to be respected
by the Israelis. So he left for Lebanon, and he said to me, "No money in
the world, no title in the world gives me greater pleasure than the pleasure
I enjoy working with our people in the camps of Shatila and elsewhere."
That inspired me; then I went through Shatila, and I went back and wrote
articles on the Palestinian situation. Then when I met Eyad, I came to
Gaza.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000099">I think I am in a unique situation
because this reminds me of my past [in South Africa], which I share with
you. In such a situation as we are in, we always look forward to something
better, but when you have everything, you have nothing to look forward
to. I think that the most important thing that I’ve experienced here is
that togetherness, that feeling of sharing which is still a part of this
society. As I said earlier -- and I do not know how to explain it...maybe
it's because of the closure of the borders -- this sharing of a common
fate, of a common situation, makes it so that the people in Gaza can be
as generous as they are. Here there is a sharing which we do not have anymore
in well-developed countries because people are living as individuals and
not as people together. What has produced a situation where individuals
leave even their families to become individuals? Here, in the Conference,
we saw and heard that children who come from intact families have better
coping strengths both in the field of education and otherwise. This is
fast disappearing in Europe, and everybody is looking forward to somewhere
where they can go back to the roots of family life -- and this I think
is so important in the Palestinian situation. Whether it will change, I
do not know. But I hope we can change the economic situation without changing
the togetherness, the feeling of group solidarity -- and I must say that
the Programme has done such wonderful work, especially now that there is
dialogue between Eyad and the PA. I hope that the situation will only improve.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000099">I think the conference was extremely
successful because, unlike many conferences, I go to -- and I do not attend
many -- this one was not full of hot air. They are usually full of hot
air. I have a picture that every word being spoken is a tiny balloon that
is drifting out of his mouth. Why did he have to say so much? If it were
like that, then the whole place would be choked with tiny balloons. But
there was a genuineness, as somebody said, the feeling of solidarity, and
not much of that feeling of voyeurism, people coming to see how lucky they
are, people coming to wallow in the pleasure people take, to tell their
friends, "I’ve been to Gaza! I have been to Gaza! We are the rescuers..."
-- there was not a significant amount of that. The papers were meaningful
and substantial, and most importantly, it was not a kind of theoretical
reflection. People had a purpose in mind; it was evident in their work.
There was closeness; it was not a campaigning, but there was action.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000099">While we all like to think of human
rights as a goal that may someday be attained, in reality it is a struggle
that never ends. No matter how much progress we ever make, human rights
violations will always occur, and the struggle for human rights can be
extremely exhausting. This conference has given us an opportunity to come
together and rouse one another’s spirits, give one another ideas about
programs that can be successful. For those of us who have been in the struggle
for many years, we are comforted by this gathering; and for those of us
who are just beginning to struggle, we are given inspiration. That has
been the real beauty of this conference. It has embraced people from all
ages and all countries, all orientations, who have come together to share
their idea, and we thank the GCMHP and Eyad, and especially those who put
together the conference.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><i><font color="#000099">Refugee Studies Programme – Oxford
University, UK</font></i></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000099">I was invited by the Gaza Community
Mental Health Programme (GCMHP) to attend this conference and receive an
award – along with many other recipients – for the RSP's contribution to
the establishment of this Center in Gaza. This is the third international
conference that has been organized by GCMHP.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000099">The conference was held in a large
well-equipped center that combines three huge separate meeting rooms. Throughout
the conference, there was excellent simultaneous translation. Lunches and
coffees were served there, allowing for maximum interaction among the participants.
All of the conference participants were entertained each evening for dinner
in a different restaurant in Gaza City.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000099">It is a challenge to portray the atmosphere
of this very significant meeting and the context in which it took place.
It attracted several hundred international visitors, including many Israeli
academics and human rights activists. For many of the latter, it was the
first time they had visited Gaza. Ironically, the only people who had difficulty
in attending were Palestinians nearby because of the near impossibility
of their getting permission to come to Gaza from the West Bank!</font></div>


<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000099">On the one hand, a realistic view of
the present situation for the Palestinians in that Gaza is now simply one
large prison for Palestinians. There are soldiers and police around, but
unlike before, it is now possible to walk anywhere at night. During my
last visit, there was still a curfew. Now, there is a busy life on the
streets of Gaza after dark that is very gratifying to see.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000099">The logistics of organizing a conference
of this size in Gaza were, to say the least, challenging for the organizers.
Every participant had to be driven in three differently licensed vehicles
to get from the airport, through the 'closures' and into Gaza City. Participants
were housed in six different hotels and transported by bus to and the conference
center and to the different locations where dinner and evening entertainment
was offered. Everything was organized perfectly. In the evaluation, the
only complaints were that the live music was too loud during the dinners!</font>
