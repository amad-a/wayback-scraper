<br>A delegation of the UN Commission on Human Rights visited the Program
on 9 January 1999.&nbsp; The delegation consisted of Mr. Hannu Halinen,
the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, and Ms. Darka
Topali, the Human Rights Officer in the Office of the UN Commissioner for
Human Rights.&nbsp; The visit came in preparation for issuing the UN annual
report of human rights violations in Palestine.
<p>The guests met Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj, GCMHP Director; Mr. Ahmad Abu Tawahina;
Dr. Tayseer Diab, Director of the Human Rights Project; and Dr. Abdel Aziz
Thabit, Director of the Children’s Project.
</p><p>Dr. El-Sarraj gave the guests an update on the continuing violations
of the Palestinian people.&nbsp; He also thanked the visitors for the Commission
on Human Rights Report on Human Rights Violations, Violations of Children’s
Rights, and their Effects on the Palestinian People.&nbsp; Also, Mr. Abu
Tawahina gave the delegation a report on the human rights situation in
Palestine and the continuous Israeli violations of Palestinian rights.
</p><p>Dr. Abdel Aziz Thabit explained to the guests the different effects
of the human rights violations on Palestinian children.&nbsp; He noted
that closures, for example, reflect on the economic situation of the people
resulting in depriving children of their breadwinners.&nbsp; Dr. Thabit
also informed the delegation of the results of a GCMHP study conducted
on Palestinian children that indicated that 21% of Palestinian children
have symptoms of anxiety.
</p><p>Moreover, Dr. Tayseer Diab gave the guests a summary of the “Rehabilitating
Survivors of Human Rights Violations” project at GCMHP.&nbsp; His presentation
included the goals of the project in the scopes of therapy, prevention,
and education.
