Mr. Hisham Abdel Razik, Palestinian Minister of Prisoners' Affairs, headed
a delegation from the Ex-Detainees Rehabilitation Program in a visit to
GCMHP.&nbsp; The guests met Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj, Mr. Ahmad Abu Tawahina,
Mr. Husam El-Nounou, and Mr. Saber El-Neirab.&nbsp; The visiting delegation
talked about the activities of the Ministry in the helping Palestinian
prisoners in Israeli jails and their families.
<p>In addition, the meeting discussed the possibilities of cooperation
between the Ministry and GCMHP in supporting Palestinian prisoners in Israeli
prisons through:
<br>&nbsp;- Exposing Israeli human rights violations against prisoners
in the local and international media.
<br>&nbsp;- Involve international human rights organizations in lobbying
for Palestinian prisoners' rights and release.
<br>&nbsp;- Exposing the racism of the Israeli judicial system.
</p><p>The guests also requested GCMHP's assistance in securing funding for
the Ex-detainees Rehabilitation Program in order for it to conduct its
various activities supporting prisoners and their families.
</p><p>Moreover, Dr. El-Sarraj suggested forming a "Palestinian Prisoners'
Support Committee" from local and international figures and organizations
to study ways of enhancing support to Palestinian prisoners and starting
income-generating projects to provide employment for ex-detainees.
</p><p>In addition, both sides agreed to continue cooperation in the area of
providing psychosocial support to prisoners, ex-detainees, and their families.
