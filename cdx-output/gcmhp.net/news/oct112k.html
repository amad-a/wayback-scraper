<p><b><b>The Intifada of Al-Aqsa:</b> GCMHP Opens a Hotline for Counseling and Visits
the Wounded and their Families
</b>
</p><p>Since the first days of the latest confrontations between Palestinians
and the Israeli army, GCMHP has carried out a series of steps to face
the effects of Israeli violence on the people. Telephone counseling was
made available to the public through a hotline that works into the
evening. Through this line, specialists offer counseling to direct and
indirect victims of violence on how to deal with the difficult
circumstances that they are passing through. In addition, the Programme
extended the working hours for some medical teams to answer people's
complaints and provide services to the public. Also, GCMHP
multi-disciplinary teams visited the wounded and their families in
hospitals to offer social and psychological support and conduct
debriefing activities with them.

</p><p>The Programme plans to continue the phone counseling service on a
permanent basis, and follow up with the victims and their families after
receiving lists of the dead and wounded.
