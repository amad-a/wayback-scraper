<font color="#000066">The visit took place in the context of the project
with TPO ( Transcultural Psychological Organization-Holland). There were
many aims for the visit:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000066">To present the initial results of the Epidemiological
Study conducted in Gaza in collaboration with TPO.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000066">To participate in designing another multi-site study
proposal on Psycho-social interventions, in which GCMHP will participate.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000066">To design a book on the TPO projects worldwide. Dr.
Elmasri was chosen to be the first author on the Gaza project. The book
is expected to be ready in final form for printing next year.</font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#000066">Dr. Joop De Jong, director of TPO-Holland, chaired
the meeting. He is a Professor in the Free University of Amsterdam, and
is well known for his work in transcultural Psychiatry. He worked as a
psychiatrist in different countries in the third world, and initiated community
mental health projects.</font>
<br><font color="#000066">Dr. Robert Giel, also a well known psychiatrist
advised and commented on the interventions. He is very well known in Gaza
since the early days of GCMHP in 1990, and has assisted in training the
GCMHP professionals.</font>
<br><font color="#000066">The participants were project directors and administrators
of the TPO projects in Nepal, Uganda, Ethiopia, Congo, Cambodia, and two
invited mental health professionals from Algeria, who were interested in
starting a Mental health project in their country. Project directors presented
the latest developments in their countries and projects. A general direction
towards more advanced and standardized intervention programs was evident
from the presentations.</font>
<br><font color="#000066">In Nepal, Dr. El Masri presented the latest statistics
on the work in GCMHP, including the work done in the areas of community
and clinical interventions, children, and rehabilitation. He also presented
a lecture on the rational of outreach preventive interventions in the area
of Community Mental Health. In the context of the meeting, the standard
clinical procedures and documentation of the GCMHP were presented for the
other projects. The audience found the presentations very informative and
requested further detailed information on the Programme activities. Many
of the participants found the work in GCMHP as a model to be followed,
and expressed their wish to visit the Programme.</font>
