<br>Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj participated in the conference on "The Role of the
European Commission in the Middle East Peace Process" organized by the
European Socialists Party on 12 and 13 November.&nbsp; He talked about
the responsibility of EC countries to actively support the Middle East
peace process, especially in view of the Israeli Government efforts to
abort peace.&nbsp; Dr. El-Sarraj stressed European liability stating that
Europe tortured, killed, and exiled Jews; then, it helped them build a
national homeland in Palestine at the expense of the original inhabitants
of the land.&nbsp; Thus Europe has a moral responsibility to help the victim's
victim.&nbsp; In addition, this supports European geographical, economic,
and refugee policies.

<p>In addition, Dr. El-Sarraj stressed the importance of cultural exchange
between Europe on the one hand and Palestine and Arab countries on the
other.&nbsp; He also said that if Europe's only concern is the Jews it
should save Israel from its current government.&nbsp; Dr. El-Sarraj also
expressed his surprise at the European position in light of the vast financial
resources that it is investing in the region.&nbsp; He wondered if Europe
was lacking leadership, unity, or will?

</p><p>Dr. El-Sarraj also inquired as to how Europe could support a country
such as Israel, in which the High Court sanctions and legalizes torturing
Palestinians.&nbsp; How can Europe finance some PA security branches that
continuously violate human rights?

</p><p>With regard to the "Wye Plantation Agreement", Dr. El-Sarraj expressed
his concern that the implementation of the agreement will be a prelude
to establishing a police state controlled by the military.&nbsp; He also
voiced his reservation about CIA involvement in the region in light of
its long history of ties with dictatorial military regimes.
