On 18 October 1998, the <a href="/gcmhp.net/women.htm" style="">Women's
Empowerment Project</a> at GCMHP organized a workshop on sexual abuse.&nbsp;
The workshop was the first of its kind organized on the subject in Gaza.
Representatives from different governmental and non-governmental institutions
including the Ministry of Social Affairs, Ministry of Youth and Sports,
Governmental Psychiatric Hospital, Education College, and the Police Force
participated in the workshop.

<p>Azza Muheisin, WEP Psychologist, presented a paper on the project's
experience in dealing with sexual abuse against women and children. She
also presented a case of a woman who was a victim of rape in her childhood.&nbsp;
In addition, Mrs. Saffa Tanees from Tamer Institute in Ramallah presented
a paper discussing sexual abuse against children and its psychological
effects.&nbsp; Moreover, Dr. Fadel Abu Hein from the Education College
presented the results of a pilot study on sexual abuse. The sample of the
study consisted of 117 college female students. The results showed that
11% were sexually harassed, 2% were raped, and that 75% of the abusers
were family members.
