&nbsp;
<br>On 27, 28 June, the Stop Torture Omnibus Program (STOP) visited Gaza
as part of its three-year world tour. Mr. Niels Zeeberg, Head of the Program
and former Project Coordinator at IRCT, explained that the main purpose
of their visit is to “call upon the Israeli State and the Palestinian Authority
to eradicate torture in their respective countries”. The visiting group
participated in a workshop on “Prevention of Torture” on 27 June on the
UN Day for the support of victims of torture, and held a press conference
at GCMHP headquarters in Gaza on 28 June.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Mr. Zeeberg also called upon Palestinians to pursue Israel in International
courts for its systematic policy of torture sanctioned by the highest judicial
authority, Israeli High Court. In addition, STOP appealed to the Palestinian
people, victims of torture and violence for decades, to stop using all
forms of violence and torture in order to preserve their strong ties with
the supporters of their just cause worldwide.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>STOP started one year ago and has already visited 33 countries. The
Program is scheduled to run for two more years in which they will visit
116 centers for rehabilitating torture survivors in more than 100 countries.
