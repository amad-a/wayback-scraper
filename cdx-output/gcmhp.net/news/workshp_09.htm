&nbsp;
<br>The Training and Education Department at GCMHP invited Australian specialist
Mr. Malcolm Fox to give a two-day workshop on "Drama for Children and Adolescents"
for school counselors and social workers from the Ministry of Social Affairs.
<br>The workshop was centered on a drama technique based on text-free drama,
group work, and finding stories from the lives of the students. This approach
allows children to think about and reflect on their lives and problems.
The participants in the workshop had exercises about problem solving, confrontation,
and how to make a drama develop and continue. In addition, Mr. Fox stressed
the importance of using this drama technique on a long-term basis in schools.
<br>On the other hand, the Training and Education Department will study
the possibility of organizing a training course on using drama for children
and adolescents.
