<p>On Wednesday, Nov. 8th, a conference, organized by "The Campus is Not Silent" group, and titled: "Ha'Yamim Ha'Noraim: Testimonies", took place at Tel Aviv University. Over 350 students and faculty heard testimony on the events which occurred in the Arab communities in Israel, on prolonged detentions in their wake, and on current events in the occupied territories. Background information was supplied on the long-standing deprivation of the Arab population in Israel, on the biased presuppositions of Israeli media, and on the de-humanization of Palestinians throughout the years.

</p><p>At the end of the evening the faculty and students put out a call:

</p><p>We call on the government of Israel to take the following steps:
<b><br>1.	To stop the detention of Arab citizens who have participated in demonstrations in the past few months and to immediately release detainees still under arrest - first and foremost the minors among them!
<br>2.	To desist from badgering the Arab members of Knesset and to stop incitement against them.
<br>3.	To stop Judification of the Galilee and Wadi Aara, and to engage in a just distribution of state land.
<br>4.	To work towards a political solution based on dismantling of all settlements and a return to the '67 borders.
</b> </p><p>
