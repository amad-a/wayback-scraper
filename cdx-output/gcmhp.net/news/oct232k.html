</b>

<p>On 23 October 2000, the GCMHP clinic in Deir El-Balah and in
coordination with the Women's Activity Center and The Deir El-Balah
Sports Club organized a public meeting on "Al-Aqsa Intifada and its
Effects on Children." The meeting was held in the Women's Activity
Center in Deir El-Balah for a number of parents and teachers.

</p><p>In his presentation, Mohammad El-Zeer pointed to the psychological,
social, economic, and health consequences of the violence on the
population as a whole and on children in particular. He pointed that
Israeli targeted children, who are more vulnerable to the effects of
violence because they have not fully developed physically,
psychologically, and cognitively. He also pointed to the effects of
trauma in children such as loss of appetite, sadness, insomnia,
nightmares, anxiety, disobedience, headaches, and others.

</p><p>After the presentation, the floor was opened for discussion, and
questions were answered.
