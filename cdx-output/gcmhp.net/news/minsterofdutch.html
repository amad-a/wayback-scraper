<p>On 25 August, the President of the GCMHP Board of Directors, Dr. Eyad
El-Sarraj, met the Dutch Foreign Minister, Mr. Jozias van Aartsen, in the
presidential guest palace in Gaza.&nbsp; Mr. Aartsen and Dr. El-Sarraj
discussed the impasse in the peace process and agreed on the historic chance
to bring peace to the Middle East after decades of war and conflict.
</p><p>Dr. Eyad stressed the vital role of the EU and Holland in bringing about
a just and lasting peace based on the respect of international law and
resolutions. He also expressed his fear that this historic chance would
be missed as a result of Israeli policies that will throw the region back
into conflict.&nbsp; Dr. El-Sarraj emphasized that progress in the peace
process should be parallel to building a democratic Palestinian society
that respects human rights and the law. In this regard, Dr. El-Sarraj asked
the Dutch Government to increase its support of the Palestinian Authority
and non-governmental organizations, especially those working in the field
of human rights.
</p><p>Dr. El-Sarraj highlighted the Israeli human rights violations over the
past three decades and the human rights violations in the Palestinian areas.&nbsp;
He also accentuated the importance of respecting people’s basic rights,
mentioning amongst other rights the right to freedom of expression and
political affiliation.
</p><p>Dr. El-Sarraj thanked Mr. Aartsen for his visit and for the Dutch support
of Palestinian institutions. Mr. Aartsen agreed to increase the Dutch support
to some of the GCMHP projects.&nbsp; He also invited Dr. El-Sarraj to visit
the Netherlands at a time to be determined later.
