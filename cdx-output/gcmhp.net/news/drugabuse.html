&nbsp;&nbsp; Output of the workshops:</li>
</blockquote>
&nbsp;1. Fifty five people were trained for community work.
<br>Each was assigned a mission and conducted at least three inter active
group meetings with young at risk individuals to affect change of attitude
towards experimentation with drugs. The young individuals were encouraged
to enjoy alternative pastimes and activities to use in their leisure time.
<br>&nbsp;2. Research study will be conducted using RAP (Rapid Assessment
Procedures) to measure the extent of drug abuse in Palestine. Each participant
was given 10 handout questionnairs to be completed.
<br>&nbsp;3. Administrative aspects of the RAP was delegated to Dr. A.
Afana of the GCMHP who will prepare the computer sheets of the RAP to be
ready for Prof. El Akabaoui and Dr. Emad Gheith. The research report will
be worked on during the next visit. Dr. A. Afana was also assigned the
responsibility of monthly monitoring of field activities to be conducted
by five trained people.
<blockquote>
<li>
&nbsp;Evaluation of Training:</li>
</blockquote>
There was consensus among participants in each workshop that the training
was unique and valuable. Participants repeatedly mentioned the wealth of
information and skills they acquired. An interactive democratic, non dictatorial
approach grew out of this, which translated into an understanding to the
needs of this age group. Daily feedback was consistently positive concluding&nbsp;
with a fast session feedback of being grateful and satisfied of what they
accomplished during a short&nbsp; period compared to what they were used
to in previous training they attended.
