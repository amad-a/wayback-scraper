</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Dr. El-Sarraj welcomed Minister Pronk
emphasizing that this special visit is an indication of the commitment
of the Government of the Netherlands towards supporting peace and justice
in Palestine. He then gave the guests a detailed description of the living
conditions of the Palestinian people and the human rights situation in
Palestine. Dr. El-Sarraj pointed out that, during the past year, there
have been tangible improvements in the Palestinian Authority’s human rights
record. Nonetheless, he made it clear that there still remain human rights
violations such as using torture, detention without trial, and violating
judicial rulings perpetrated by the security apparatus.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Moreover, Dr. El-Sarraj gave the visiting
delegation an overview of the possible scenarios of the peace process,
stressing the fact that, regardless of these scenarios, building the democratic
process in Palestine is a long and difficult task, which is nonetheless
vital. Dr. El-Sarraj expressed his optimism in achieving this goal with
the efforts of the Palestinian democratic forces and international backing.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Dr. El-Sarraj also briefed the guests
on the need for local and international backing to enhance the role of
the Palestinian Legislative Council in improving the human rights situation
and democracy in Palestine. He also emphasized the importance of the work
of the different branches of the civil police, and the need for continuous
technical and professional support from the Dutch Government in this regard.
Dr. El-Sarraj also noted the need to ensure the freedom of the press in
the process of democratic building in Palestine.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Following the description of the situation
in Palestine, Dr. El-Sarraj explained the different activities of GCMHP
and the services it provides to the community in the Gaza Strip. He gave
special notice to the post-graduate diploma in community mental health
that started in January 1997 as the first of its kind in the Middle East,
and emphasizes mental health and human rights. Dr. El-Sarraj pointed out
that there are efforts to open channels with other Arab countries that
could benefit from the Palestinian experience in community mental health.
Finally, Dr. El-Sarraj expressed the desire of the Palestinian people in
cooperating with Europe, and particularly the Netherlands, in preserving
their rights; and in expanding cultural and educational cooperation between
them.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Minister Pronk informed the hosts that
the Netherlands is interested in developing its relations with the Palestinians,
noting that this is the second visit he makes to GCMHP.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">It is duly noted that the Government
of the Netherlands gives financial and technical support to certain projects
within GCMHP, notably the “Rehabilitation of Ex-political Prisoners Project”
and the “Training and Education Department”.</font>
