<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">On May 15 and 16, Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj
participated in an International Conference on “Health and Human Rights”
in Stockholm, Sweden. The conference was organized by several Scandinavian
human rights organizations including Amnesty International, Physicians
for Human Rights, and others caring for the rights of refugees, asylum
seeker, and torture survivors. 250 human rights activists from Scandinavia
and Europe participated.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Dr. El-Sarraj gave a paper on “Palestinian
Human Rights and Mental Health” pointing to the fiftieth anniversary of
the State of Israel and the Palestinian “Nakba” (catastrophe) and uprooting.
He stressed that the cycle of violence in the Middle East started in Europe
with the persecution of Jews, who directed their hatred and frustration
on a new victim (the Palestinian people). Moreover, he talked about the
systematic Israeli policy of humiliation, torture, and destruction that
has stripped children of feelings of safety and security and, thus, continuing
the cycle of violence between the two peoples as well as within each individual
community. In addition, Dr. El-Sarraj indicated that the Israelis tortured
about two hundred thousand Palestinians; and that, today, thirty thousand
still suffer the effects of torture and pose a problem to society.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">In his presentation, Dr. El-Sarraj called
upon people working in the field of rehabilitating torture survivors to
raise their voice to stop all forms of torture and violence before it occurs.
He also encouraged the conference participants to call upon Israel to stop
its policy of settlement building, house demolition, torture, and oppression.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Dr. El-Sarraj stated that peace is the
only solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict. However, peace must be based
on justice, the guarantee of Palestinian rights, and the establishment
of a Palestinian State.</font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">In addition to participating in the
conference, Dr. El-Sarraj took part in a rally for solidarity with Palestinians
organized by the Palestinian Solidarity Association in Sweden in the main
square in Stockholm.</font>
