<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The relations between traumatic events,
perceived parenting styles, children’s resources, political activity, and
psychological adjustment were examined among 108 Palestinian boys and girls
of 11-12 years of age. The results showed that exposure to traumatic events
increased psychological adjustment problems directly and via 2 mediating
paths. First, the more traumatic events children had experienced , the
more negative parenting the experienced. And the poorer they perceived
parenting, the more they suffered from high neuroticism and low self-esteem.
Second the more traumatic events children had experienced the more political
activity they showed and the more active they were , the more they suffered
from psychological adjustment problems.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Good perceived parenting protected
children’s psychological adjustment by making them less vulnerable in two
ways. First traumatic events decreased their intellectual , creative and
cognitive resources, and a lack of resources predicted many psychological
adjustment problems in a model excluding perceived parenting second political
activity increased psychological adjustment problems in the same model,
but not in the model including parenting.&nbsp;</font><br>
