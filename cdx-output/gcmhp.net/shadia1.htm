by her father in cold blood. One night, he asked her to join him for a
walk. After killing her, he returned home looking for her and asking everybody:
“Have you seen Reem?” After a week of searching, her body was found by
the seashore.&nbsp;</font></b></div>

<div dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">By chance one of his sons followed
him that night and watched his sister killed and buried. His school teacher
noticed a change in his temper and behavior. The teacher called the police,
who asked him about what happened. The young brother told them everything.
“That night my father asked Reem to join him for a walk. I felt jealous
and I wanted to join them. By the seashore they stopped. My father dug
a hole and asked Reem to jump in, then he broke her neck, buried her and
returned back home asking: ‘Where is Reem?’”</font></b></div>


<p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">The obvious question is why a young
girl would be killed by her father? In Reem’s case, police investigations
found that her father suspected that Reem had illegal sexual relations!!</font></b>

</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">Reem’s parents were divorced when
she was only few months old. After their separation and remarriage to other
people, she joined her grandparents. At the age of 11, her father started
to force her to come back to him. According to the Personal Status Law,
the father has the right of female custody at the age of 9. The reason
he wanted to bring her back was to serve his new wife who has many children.
Reem became the house-maid and was taken out of school.</font></b>

</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">When Reem’s body was examined, she
was found to be a virgin. Her body was full of scars and bruises and her
hair was shaved. Also, there was a scar of about 25 inches on her head.</font></b>

</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">The father is now in prison, but
according to the Personal Status Law this crime will be considered an honor
killing, not a murder. This means that he will be sentenced to a maximum
of 2-3 years.</font></b>
