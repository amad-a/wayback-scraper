<p>Seeing him, well built, bright, and mature, you might think of him as
a movie star.&nbsp; He has a presence that is so intense and so human.&nbsp;
Although he is not a playboy, he is seductive and overtaking by his fascinating
engagement as a militant Palestinian for 30 years, first against Israeli
Occupation, against all forms of violence and abuse of the law, and today
against violence and abusing the law violence his compatriots.

</p><p>He is also a psychiatrist in charge of a the Gaza Community Mental Health
Program that offers mental health services to the population of the Gaza
Strip including children of the Intifada, victims of a double loss: Lack
of reference, destruction of their homes, and the death of their fathers.
He has started a diploma project in community mental health in cooperation
with seven international universities, one of which in Tunis University.
He is also the Commissioner General of the Palestinian Independent Commission
for Citizens’ Rights.

</p><p>He is in Tunisia to mobilize support for his project. In this interview,
we take the opportunity to talk with an authentic intellectual and a doctor
who can be taken for the Franz Fanon of Palestinians.

</p><p><b>Q:</b> You are the Commissioner General of the Palestinian Independent
Commission for Citizens’ Right.&nbsp; What made you accept this position?

</p><p>After the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, a decree was signed
by President Arafat, in his authority as the president of Palestine, which
founded this commission. It is an independent commission whose member is
not appointed by the PA.

</p><p><b>Q:</b> What are the prerogatives of this commission?

</p><p>We receive and direct all complaints of the citizens’ human rights violations,
particularly in cases of violence are abuse of public authority that originates
from State Agencies and there administration, from its security apparatus.

</p><p><b>Q: </b>For Example?

</p><p>For example, last year we registered 550 complains from ordinary Palestinian
citizens.&nbsp; A large part of the complaints were of violations of human
rights, bad treatment, illegal imprisonment, denying the rights etc…by
the police force.&nbsp; Also, there are complains against civil administration
concerning cases of injustice. We also contributed to the reform of the
Palestinian jurisdiction, and the totality of different laws than came
from diverse origins (Israeli, Jordanian, Ottoman, and British). We are
engaged in the process of Law reform and we have co-produced a text of
basic laws.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this text, which was received the ratified
by the Legislative Council, was submitted to President Arafat, who has
not signed it as of yet.
<br>&nbsp;
<br><b>Q:</b> The Palestinian Authority arrested you on several occasions.
What are the reasons?

</p><p>To start with, the commission was established by Hanan Ashraoui, the
first Commissioner General. In June 1995, I was elected as Commissioner
General, so I revised all the complaints submitted.&nbsp; They were regarding
violations of human rights by the Police and neglect by the Attorney General.&nbsp;
I addressed the Palestinian Authority pointing that the situation was serious
and alarming.&nbsp; I did not get any answer. I was arrested the following
day and detained for 24 hours.&nbsp; They told me not to engage myself
in such affairs but I refused.
<br>Few months later, there were signs of cooperation by the Authority
on building its power through the Law.&nbsp; We have thought that the page
was turned, and a new era began.
<br>However, after having denunciating all forms of oppression, I was arrested
for 9 days.&nbsp; I was well treated. Then Palestinian Authority received
me and we had an understanding of a more convenient functioning.

</p><p><b>Q:</b> What is the security dimension of the Palestinian Power?&nbsp;
Is it the result of the American and Israeli pressure or is it in the nature
of an authoritarian regime?

</p><p>There is nothing than can justify the violation of law and human rights
and victimizing citizens. In my opinion, nothing can justify violence,
not even the excuse that Israel exercises pressure, which is by the way
true.&nbsp; America also exercises pressure.&nbsp; It is true; however,
these two countries are colonial, racist, and function with the logic of
occupation.
<br>With regards to the Arab culture of domination, the Palestinian Authority
is formed from outside according to a system of a secretive and clandestine
organization without a democratic tradition. We must develop consequently
a democratic culture and respect of the power of law.

</p><p><b>Q:</b> How has Mohiydeen El-Sharief’s death affected the situation?

</p><p>Up till that incident, there were improvements. We visited the prisoners
and detained political activists. We had an agreement to visit prisoners
after three days of detention, which is by the way not done in other Arab
countries. There was also a signed charter concerning torture specially
death under torture. Unfortunately, with the Mohiydeen El-Sharief affair,
the situation regressed and became more complied. The Palestinian Authority
accuses Hamas, who denies the accusations.&nbsp; The result was arrests
of Hamas activists.

</p><p><b>Q:</b> In relation to establishing the democratic process and Palestinians’
resistance under ten’s of years to the oppression of occupation, did the
stuggle contribute to the establishment of a conscience and a real wish
for democracy?&nbsp; Is this the beginning of a civil Palestinian Society?

</p><p>Certainly, there is a strong relationship between the Palestinian struggle
for its liberty and the construction of a civil society.&nbsp; We always
demanded our right to democracy and resisted the violence exercised by
the Israels.&nbsp; Yet, we Palestinian rights were sometimes defended by
Israelis. In some instances, the best lawyers for our cause were Israelis
protesting against the military Israeli occupation. Incidentally, we were
also the witnesses of a democratic political life in Israel, if for Jews
only.&nbsp; Israel is a democracy if you are a Jew. The Palestinian living
in Israel and those of Gaza and the West Bank were witnesses to democratic
institutions, laws, etc…
<br>The Palestinians in Exile are different since they lived in a different
political culture. That is why, in Palestine today there are two kinds
of political cultures.&nbsp; But there is a strong determination to construct
a democratic society, and this can be felt in some PA figures as well as
intellectuals.

</p><p><b>Q:</b> Are the children of the Intifada had dreams of freedom. You
know it from being a psychiatric who worked with them.

</p><p>During the Intifada, the Israeli occupation destroyed the two symbols
of security: the fathers imprisoned, tortured, killed and the houses were
demolished.&nbsp; As a result, the children were traumatized when witnessing
the murder of their fathers and the destruction of their houses.&nbsp;
The generation of the Intifada was profoundly disturbed.&nbsp; Our research
on the mental health in Gaza indicates that 15% of the population in Gaza
were tortured and 20% were witnesses of grave violence including murder
under Israeli occupation, 17% of the population suffer from psychiatric
disorders depression and other psychiatric pathologies as a result of traumatism.
Trauma is a serious product of violence.&nbsp; Also the persons who were
victims of violence are today aggressive to their families and the fellow
citizens. We see this in households, in the streets, and in the prisons,
where the guardians abuse their position of the authority. We understand
the needs for rehabilitation to rights and justice. This conscience and
determination is felt all over.

</p><p><b>Q:</b> During the Intifada you were a psychiatrist.&nbsp; What is
your role today?

</p><p>I have established the Gaza Mental Health Program today.&nbsp; We have
six centers and we have exchanges of seven international universities.
We have received help of Tunisian psychology’s trainees and cooperate with
Prof. of Psychology A. Mahjoub from Tunis University. We have started a
post graduate diploma in community mental health. We wish to receive Tunisian
doctors and psychologists to help us in this program.&nbsp; I have approached
Tunisian Educators from the Ministry of Education in this respect.&nbsp;
In addition, we have projects for traumatized children, victims of torture,
and women victims of violence.

</p><p><b>Q:</b> Do you think that this democratic process in Palestine could
serve as a model and initiate change in the rest of the Arab World?

</p><p>The Palestinian experience is unique in many facets.&nbsp; We are still
in the beginning of processes of building a civil society and a democratic
state.
