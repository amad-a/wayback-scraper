between traumatic experiences, parenting styles, children's political activity,
resources and psychological adjustment were examined among 108 Palestinian
boys and girls of 11-12 years of age. Results showed that children exposed
to a high level of traumatic experiences perceive their mothers and fathers
more disciplining, punishing and rejecting than children exposed to low
level of trauma. Also, the more traumatic experiences children had, the
more hostile they perceived their mother's parenting style. Boys perceived
both parents more disciplining, punishing and rejecting, and their mothers
more hostile than girls. Parenting had both mediating and moderating role
in the relationship between traumatic experiences and children's adjustment.
Exposure to traumatic experiences increased both directly and through poor
parenting children's psychological adjustment problems. Good parenting
moderated the negative impact of traumatic experiences on children's psychological
adjustment: trauma significantly increased adjustment problems only among
children whose parents were punishing, rejecting, hostile, and non-loving.</font>
