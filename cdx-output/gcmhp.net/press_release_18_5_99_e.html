<p><font size="+1">Ayman Mohammad El-Ammasi (32, from Jabalia) was transferred
from the Police headquarters in Gaza to the Intensive Care Unit of Shifa
Hospital in a state of unconsciousness and with visible signs of torture
on his body.&nbsp; This incident brings back to mind memories of previous
incidences of torture and death in custody, which the Palestinians suffered
from during the Israeli occupation and when the Palestinian Authority was
established.</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">At the time, human rights organizations and activists
joined international efforts to pressure the PA in adopting a policy of
respecting human rights.&nbsp; Consequently, there was tangible improvement
in the PA's human right record; and some of the PA security branches opened
their prisons for monitoring.</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">However, this incidence of Ayman El-Ammasi raises the
question of the respect of human rights, especially in Palestinian prisons.&nbsp;
In this regard, it is a necessity that we all take practical steps to stop
the human rights violations.&nbsp; On the personal and popular level, we
all should lobby the PA to ensure its respect of human rights by drafting
laws that include human rights as a key component, and opening prisons
to independent monitoring.</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">As to the case of Ayman El-Ammasi, it is necessary that
the PA establish an commission to investigate the incidence and get to
the truth behind it.&nbsp; Was the arrest legal? What are the reasons that
led to transferring Ayman to the hospital?&nbsp; Who, if any, are responsible?&nbsp;
All those found of breaking the law should be put to trial.</font>
