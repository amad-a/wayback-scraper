<p><font size="+1">Since the return of the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA), the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been targeted by
systematic campaigns aimed at tarnishing their image and undermining their
achievements.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that NGOs working in the
field of human rights are especially targeted by these campaigns.&nbsp;
The attacks go as far as slandering human rights activists such as Dr.
Haidar Abdel Shafi, Mr. Raji Sourani, Mr. Khader Shkirat, and Dr. Eyad
El-Sarraj in an attempt to reduce their credibility.&nbsp; Indeed, the
defamation goes to make some of the campaigners legally liable.</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">Over the past few days, the anti-NGO campaigns resurfaced
after the publication of the UNSCO report on the funding towards the "Rule
of Law" sector over the past five years.&nbsp; This sector includes the
Ministry of Justice, courts, Attorney General's Office, Police, Forensic
Lab, Palestinian Legislative Council, Palestinian Independent Commission
for Citizens' Rights, and relevant NGOs.&nbsp; The report states that the
funding for the NGOs under that sector for the past five years did not
exceed 16% of the total amount.</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">While we agree with the Minister of Justice on the importance
of strengthening the Ministry of Justice and the judicial system and not
spending the grants on foreign experts, there is no justification to the
attacks on the NGOs and undermine their credibility and competence.</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">We must admit that the judicial system in our country
is in disarray, lacks careful planning, and has a significantly diminished
authority.&nbsp; This led to an increasing feeling of frustration and discontent
amongst the workers in the judiciary.&nbsp; Likewise, other sectors endure
the same problem existent in the judicial system.&nbsp; The spreading of
favoritism and abuse of power compounds these problems.</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">If the driving force behind these campaigns is to redirect
the funds for NGOs toward PNA agencies, this is a very basic misunderstanding.&nbsp;
If the funding for Palestinian NGOs is stopped, it will not be redirected
towards the Palestinian Authority.&nbsp; On the contrary, it may be reallocated
to fund NGOs in other countries.</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">If the goal behind these campaigns is to raise the level
of competence of the NGOs, this goal cannot be achieved through indiscriminate,
intentional defamation.&nbsp; The NGOs working in the field of human rights
are a component of the overall Palestinian struggle trying to expose the
policies and practices of the occupation against our people.&nbsp; They
are also an integral part of the effort attempting to build the Palestinian
society after suffering decades of occupation and humiliation.&nbsp; Building
our homeland has not been and will not be free of errors.&nbsp; He who
works is bound to make a mistake; and he who does nothing will not make
any mistakes.&nbsp; What we all need is that courage and frankness to diagnose
the mistakes and admit to making them before putting forth solutions to
them.</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">If the aim of the anti-NGO campaigns is to establish the
principles of transparency and to fight corruption, we very much support
the aim. In fact, the NGOs cannot ask the PNA to battle corruption and
adopt transparency if the NGOs do not practice their preaching. However,
it is becoming apparent that the campaigns reflect the increasing feeling
of incompetence in the different branches of the PNA, which led the PNA
propaganda machine to try to diminish the success of the NGOs, and even
try to destroy those organizations.</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">It is essential that the work of the NGOs be regulated
by a law that ensures the transparency of these organizations and coordinate
their activities in accordance with national plans for each sector.&nbsp;
In this regard, it is imperative that the NGO law adopted by the Palestinian
Legislative Council be published in the official Gazette and implemented.</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">We all strive to build Palestine, a state based on the
rule of law that ensures freedom, dignity, and equality to all.&nbsp; If
our request for democratic participation in building our homeland, abiding
by the law, fighting corruption, and respecting the dignity of the people
do not follow the whims of some, these people should look into their hearts
before hurling accusations at others.</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">In conclusion, I call upon all Palestinian organizations
to stand up to this misleading campaign targeting hundreds of NGOs and
thousands of people who offer essential services to the Palestinian people.&nbsp;
I also call upon the&nbsp; officials in the PNA to issue their instructions
to stop the campaign of slander and defamation and resort to the principles
of the law and democratic dialogue.</font>
