<p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066"><font size="+1">'<i>Dr. Eyad Rajab
El Sarraj</i> has been awarded the 1998 Martin Ennals Award for human Rights
Defenders (MEA) for his outstanding Courageous achievements in human rights
in Palestine', announced Mr. Adama Dieng (President of the Martin Ennals
Foundation) at a human rights conference in Tunis.</font></font></b>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"><font size="+1">Dr. Sarraj is the founder
and Director of the <b><i>Gaza Community Mental Health Programme (GCMHP)</i></b>,
which provides support for those affected by the Intifida and the organized
violence of the Israeli occupation. The GCMHP also contributes to public
awareness and empowerment, in addition to therapy for individuals and groups.</font></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"><font size="+1">As co-founder and Commissioner
General of the <b><i>Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizen's Rights</i></b>,
(which acts on complaints from Palestinian citizens) he has played an active
role in furthering democracy in Palestine. His open criticism of the Palestinian
National Authorities has placed him in great danger and has resulted in
his arrest on three occasions, most recently in June 1996. Where he has
experienced violence, torture, prolonged solitary confinement, and lack
of access to an attorney. Dr. Sarraj also participates in prevention of
torture worldwide as a member of the Campaign Against Torture in the Middle
East and North Africa.</font></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"><font size="+1">Dr.Sarraj has said that
he plans to use the Award money to write a book detailing the political
upheavals that have engulfed Palestine in the last ten years. He stated:
'Stories of abuse of women, trauma among children, political leadership
and mass psychology are some of the themes that I will include in the book.'</font></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"><font size="+1">The MEA was created in
1992 to honour Martin Ennals, a life-long campaigner for human lights,
who died in 1991. The award aims to encourage human rights defenders, particularly
those working in hostile conditions. He helped build Amnesty International,
HURIDOCS, International Alert, SOS Torture, Defence for children International,
and and Article XIX. Other NG0s co-operate in the Martin Ennals Foundation,
such as the International Commission of Jurists and the International Federation
of Human Rights.</font></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"><font size="+1">'By issuing such a prestigious
award, a message is sent to all regimes and brutal forces that the world
will not submit, and that human rights activists can never be silenced.'</font></font>
