<p><font color="#000066">The Gaza Community Mental Health Programme (GCMHP)
is in the midst of its third international conference. This year's October
13-15 conference on "Health and Human Rights" has failed to come off without
a hitch because of an unfortunate spate of Israeli interference. Several
invited guests have been prevented from traveling to the conference by
Israeli authorities. Ostensibly, invited guests did not appear at Eretz
checkpoint at the stated time and were thus prohibited from entering. Israeli
good-will and its desire to promote peaceful regional relationships must
be called into question when it prevents health and human rights advocates
from participating in a conference intended to alleviate human suffering.</font>

</p><p><font color="#000066">The ten participants prevented from attending
the conference thus far are: Mustafa Barghouthi, M.D. and Director of the
Union of Palestinian Medical Relief Committees, Dr. Ahmad Baker, Khalil
Toma (translator), Rana Nashashibi, Reema Shwaiki, Khalida Jarrar, Mahmoud
Sehwail, Khalid Batrawi, Ahmed Sayyad, Vivian Khamis, and Lisa Fliegel
(all the way from the USA). The GCMHP and the conference participants condemn
the Israeli intransigence in preventing the free travel of Palestinians
and an American citizen to the Gaza Strip. Harm has already been caused
to the integrity of the conference schedule and it is our hope that the
Israeli authorities will remedy the situation as much as possible in the
immediate future by permitting the above-mentioned individuals to enter
Gaza at this time.</font>
