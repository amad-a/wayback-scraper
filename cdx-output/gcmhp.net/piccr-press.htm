<div dir="LTR"><font face="CG Times,Times New Roman"><font color="#000066">The
Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens' Rights (PICCR) is following
with great anxiety the matter of the political detainees held in the detention
centres of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), who have been protesting
their long periods of detention without charges, without being presented
before a judge, and who are deprived of the due process of law. O<i>n t</i>he
human side, there have been dire consequences as well, in terms of loss
of employment or their being prevented from completing their studies. Several
among them have also suffered from untreated illnesses, and all of them
have felt strongly the denial of rights to which they gave been subjected.
As a result they have declared an open hunger strike.</font></font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font face="CG Times,Times New Roman"><font color="#000066">From
the time, one week ago, when the political detainees in Jneid military
prison announced they were going on an open hunger strike, the Commission
has been getting in constant touch with the Palestinian Authority at all
levels, demanding that these cases be examined and that they be released
immediately, particularly as we are approaching the 'aid al'adha' (Feast
of the Sacrifice).</font></font></div>


<p dir="LTR"><font face="CG Times,Times New Roman"><font color="#000066">The
Commission has likewise made various attempts to visit the hunger strikers
so as to gain more information as to their present condition. Unfortunately,
the administration of Jneid military prison, which is not trained or qualified
to run a prison which includes civilians, has refused to co-operate with
the Commission and has not allowed its lawyers or field researchers to
visit these detainees, or to have any contacts with them whatsoever. It
should be noted that, in contract to all other prison administrations of
the Palestinian Authority, Jneid prison has to the present date, never
shown any willingness to co-operate with the Commission.</font></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font face="CG Times,Times New Roman"><font color="#000066">We
have sent a letter to General Hajj Ismael Jaber, Head of the National Security
Forces in the West Bank, In which we demanded that the lawyers of our Commission
be permitted to visit and talk to the prisoners. Despite our repeated daily
contacts with his office, we were constantly given excuses and delays by
way of answers to our requests.</font></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><font face="CG Times,Times New Roman"><font color="#000066">The
Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens' Rights protests in the
strongest terms the continued detention of these citizens without cause,
and considers this a clear violation of the most elementary of human rights,
contradicting international conventions and agreements as well as domestic
legal norms. We likewise strongly protest the refusal of the office of
General <u>Hajj</u> Ismael to grant the Commission's lawyers permission
to visit the prisoners, and declare this to be unprecedented. We fear that
the reason for this refusal is the decision to conceal the violations of
prisoners' rights being perpetrated within the prison.</font></font>

</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font face="CG Times,Times New Roman"><font color="#000066">We
therefore call upon the leadership of the Palestinian National Authority
to adopt a clear and courageous stance, and put an end to the suffering
of dozens of political prisoners and their families, who are entirely innocent
of any crimes. We likewise demand that the PICCR's lawyers and representatives
of all human rights organisations be granted immediate permission to visit
the prisoners so as to find out what they are actually living through in
the military prison.</font></font></b>
