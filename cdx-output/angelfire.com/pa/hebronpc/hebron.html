<b><tt><font color="#3333FF">The Story of the Cave's Purchase</font></tt></b>
<p>Abraham, peace be upon him, bought the cave. While this matter is irrelevant
to the history of the city, it should be told this way to demonstrate the
entire story of "purchasing the city or part of it." So for those who use
the skewed logic of seizing private properties from our people nowadays
under the pretense that Abraham, peace be on him, purchased the cave in
Hebron, we say that they owe the equivalent of this Cave and one and a
half like it.
</p><p>The bible tells that Abraham, peace be on him, purchased the Cave for
the full market price of 400 silver shekel [Tanach - Genesis Chapter 23:
16. And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver,
which he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels
of silver, current money among the merchants.]&nbsp; But two chapters earlier
in Genesis, the bible tells that the king of the land, Abimelech, gave
Abraham and his wife, Sarah, peace be on them, one thousand pieces of silver&nbsp;
[Tanach - Genesis Chapter 20:16. And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given
your brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold, he is to you a covering
of the eyes, to all who are with you, and with all other; thus she was
reproved.]

<p><b><tt><font color="#3333FF">Names of the City:-</font></tt></b>
</p><p>Ancient Canaanite name:- <b><i>Arbo'a</i></b> which is derived from
the word "four." It is believed that the city was called so because it
is surrounded by four main mountains.
</p><p>Present Arabic:- <b><i>Al Khalil</i></b> means "the friend." The city
was named after Prophet Abraham who was called "Khalil" in the Quran [i.e.
4:125 Who can be better in religion than one who submits his whole self
to Allah, does good, and follows the way of Abraham the true in faith?
For Allah did take Abraham for a friend.]
</p><p>Ancient and present Hebrew: <b><i>Hevron</i></b> the word is highly
related to the words "Haver and Havror" in Hebrew which mean "Friend."
</p><p>Ancient Hebrew:- <b><i>Kiriath Arba</i></b> means "the suburb of four."
<br>The Jewish holy scriptures say that the this name was given because
four couples (Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Jacob and Leah, and Isaac
and Rebecca were buried there.
</p><p>Talmud - Mas. Sotah 13a
<br><i>And there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation.7
It has been taught: Even the horses and asses [joined in the lamentation].
When [the cortege] arrived at the Cave of Machpelah, Esau came and wished
to prevent [the interment there], saying to them, Mamre, Kiriath-arba,
the same is Hebron8 — now R. Isaac has said: Kiriath-arba [is so called]
because four couples [were buried there], viz. Adam and Eve, Abraham and
Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, and Jacob and Leah — [Jacob] had buried Leah
in his portion and what remains belongs to me’. They replied to him, ‘Thou
didst sell it’. He said to them, ‘Granted that I sold my birth-right, but
did I sell my plain heir's right!’</i>
</p><p><b><i>Hebron</i></b>. The English name of the city derived from the
Hebrew name Hevron.

<p><b><tt><font color="#3333FF">Why Hebron is important to Jews and Muslims</font></tt></b>
</p><p>For Muslims
</p><p>For Muslims, Hebron is holy because it has the Magarat (Cave, Colloquial
Gar) where Muslims believe that Abraham was buried. To Muslims, Abraham,
is called the father of all the prophets. Muslims cannot be Muslims without
the absolute belief in the prophecies of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as well
as the Torah as the word of God. <b>In the holy Muslim book, the Quran,
Abraham, Jacob and Isaac were named 73, 18 and 16 times, respectively as
opposed to only 4 times for the prophet of Islam, Muhammad</b>.
</p><p>Jews revere the Cave for the same reason.

</p><p>Arabic AL-KHALIL, in full AL-KHALIL AR-RAHMAN ("The Beloved of [God]
the Merciful" [a reference to Abraham]), Hebrew HEVRON, city in the southern
Judaean Hills, south-southwest of Jerusalem. It is 3,050 feet (930 m) above
sea level. In modern times, it was part of mandated Palestine during 1923-48;
after the Arab-Israeli War of 1948-49, it was in the territory annexed
by Jordan (1950); since the Six-Day War of June 1967, it has been part
of the West Bank (Judaea and Samaria) territory under Israeli administration.
</p><p>Hebron is one of the oldest cities in the region; because of its associations
with the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and with King David,
it is one of the four holy cities of Judaism (Jerusalem, Hebron, Tiberias,
and Zefat [Safed]). Islam, which reveres Abraham as a founder of monotheism
and precursor of Muhammad, also considers it a holy city.
</p><p>An ancient Canaanite royal city, Hebron was founded "seven years before
Zoan in Egypt" (Numbers 13:22), and Zoan, later Tanis, the capital of the
Hyksos invaders, has been dated to the 18th century BC. Abraham, founder
of the Jewish people, long lived in Hebron, which was often referred to
as Qiryat Arba' (Hebrew: "City of the Four," or "Tetrapolis"), possibly
referring to four confederated settlements in the area in biblical times,
or to the fact that the city is built on four hills. At Hebron, Abraham
purchased the cave of Mach-pelah as a burial place for his wife, Sarah,
from Ephron the Hittite (Genesis 23); this became a family sepulchre. According
to tradition, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with their wives Sarah, Rebekah,
and Leah, were buried in the cave. After the exodus from Egypt, Hebron
was one of the cities visited by the spies sent by Moses. Later, Joshua
fought the Battle of Aijalon, where "the sun stood still," against a confederation
of Amorite chiefs including the "king of Hebron" (Joshua 10).
</p><p>King David (c. 10th century BC) was ordered by God to go to Hebron;
he was anointed king of Israel there, and made it his capital for 7 1/2
years, until the taking of Jerusalem (II Samuel 2-5). In post-exilic times
Hebron fell to the Edomites; King Herod the Great (ruled 37-4 BC) built
a wall around the cave of Mach-pelah, portions of which survive beneath
additions by Byzantines, crusaders, and Mamluks. The Muslims ruled the
city from AD 635 until after World War I, except for 1100-1260, when the
crusaders controlled it.
</p><p>In the early 20th century, Hebron was a Muslim Arab city, with a small,
old Jewish community, largely of pious seminarians. In the Arab riots of
1929, 67 Hebron Jews were massacred; the remainder of the community left
the city after the beginning of the Arab uprising of 1936-39.
</p><p>Modern Hebron is an agricultural marketing and trade centre, with glass
and leather manufactures. The Cave of Mach-pelah (Hebrew Me'arat ha-Makhpela)
is surmounted by a large mosque, al-Haram al-Ibrahimi al-Khalil (The Sanctuary
of Abraham, the Friend). After the Six-Day War (1967), the tombs of the
patriarchs were opened to all worshippers for the first time in exactly
700 years, the original prohibition against non-Muslims having been made
by the Mamluk sultan Baybars in 1267. Both Muslim and Jewish services are
now held in the cave; the upper mosque remains the exclusive property of
the Muslims. In 1968 Orthodox settlers renewed Jewish presence in the city;
their presence was finally approved by the Israeli government in 1970,
and a new housing project for them was built in the early 1970s. Many tourists
and pilgrims visit the Cave of Mach-pelah and other sites connected with
the lives of the patriarchs, such as Abraham's Oak (Hebrew, Eshel Avraham),
just northwest of the city. Pop. (1984 est.) 75,000.

</p><h3>
Hebron</h3>
(<i>hbrwn, chebrón</i>)
<p>An ancient royal city of Chanaan, famous in biblical history, especially
at the time of the patriarchs and under David. During the Middle Ages it
was an episcopal see — at present it is only a titular one — and was situated
in Palestine Prima, with Cæsarea as metropolitan. Hence the division
of this article into two parts: (I) Biblical Epoch, (II) Christian Epoch.
</p><center>
<p><b>BIBLICAL EPOCH</b></p></center>

<p>Hebron is one of the earliest towns mentioned in history. According
to the Bible (Num., xiii, 23) it was founded seven years before Zoan or
Tanis, the most ancient town in Lower Egypt, which means that it existed
from the first half of the third millennium <font size="-1">B. C.</font>
Josephus (Bel. Jud., IV, ix, 7) says that in his time the town was already
2300 years old. It was originally called Kiriat Arba, or Kiriat- ha-Arba
(D. V. Cariath-Arbe, Gen., xxiii, 2, xxxv, 27; Jos., xiv, 15, xv, 13, 54,
xx, 7, xxi, 11; Judges, i, 10; II Esd., xi, 25) from the name of Arba,
"the greatest among the Enacims" (Jos., xiv, 15). The Vulgate, taking the
common name <i>ha-adam</i> in this last expression, i. e. the man, for
the proper name
<i>Adam,</i> translates as follows: "Adam the greatest
among the Enacim was laid there"; whence it should not be inferred, as
was the case with some ancient authors, that Hebron contains the tomb of
the first man. The explanation of the name <i>Kiriat-Arba</i> by the Bible
shows all others to be merely fanciful. Such, for instance, is that of
St. Jerome (De locis et nominibus locorum Hebraicorum, s. v. Arbac, P.
L., XXIII, 862; Ep. xlvi, P. L., XXII, 491; Ep. cviii, P. L. XXII, 886;
Quest. in Gen., P. L., XXIII, 978) and of some Jewish commentators who
take the word Arba to mean "four", and Kiriat-Arba to be the "town of the
four", i. e. the four patriarchs buried in the cave of Machpelah: Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, to whom must be added, according to various opinions,
either Adam, Caleb, Esau, or Joseph. According to de Saulcy (Voyage en
Terre Sainte, I, 152) the name means "the town of the four quarters"; while
it suits the modern town, this is not at all true of the ancient one. The
Bible, however, insists over and over again on the true origin of the name:
"Cariath-Arbe the father of Enac, which is Hebron" (Jos., xv, 13; xxi,
11). The name Hebron is also very ancient. It appears under the form <i>Cheburo</i>
on Egyptian monuments of the second milennium <font size="-1">B. C.</font>
(Brügsch, "Geog. Inschriften altägypt. Denkmäler", II, 76).
</p><p>The earliest mention of Hebron in the Scriptures occurs (Gen., xiii,
18) on the occasion of Abraham's coming to the vale of Mambre; and this
last name is often given to Hebron (Gen., xxiii, 19, xxxv, 27). On the
death of Sara, his wife, the patriarch bought from Ephron the Hethite the
cave of Machpelah to serve as a burying place for his family (Gen., xxiii);
Abraham himself was buried there (Gen., xxv, 9), as were also Isaac (Gen.,
xxxv, 27-29) and Jacob (Gen., l, 13). Hebron thus became the second homeland
of Abraham, and the centre of attraction during the wanderings of the patriarchs.
Isaac and Jacob dwelt at Mambre, and it was from the "vale of Hebron" that
Joseph was sent towards Sichem and Dothain to inquire after his brethren
(Gen., xxxvii, 14, 17). The Hebrew spies sent by Moses into Chanaan went
as far as Hebron, and it was from the adjacent valley of Escol that they
brought back a vine-branch with its cluster of grapes, and some pomegranates
and figs (Num., xiii, 23-25). When the Israelites invaded Chanaan, Oham,
King of Hebron, allied himself against them with four other Chanaanite
princes to besiege Gabaon. After Josue had defeated them, and put them
to death, he went on to attack Hebron, which he took, putting all its inhabitants
to death (Jos., x, 3, 23-26, 36-37; xi, 21; xii, 10). On the division of
the Promised Land, Hebron fell to the tribe of Juda and was given to Caleb
(Jos., xiv, 13, 14, xv, 13, 54; Judges, i, 20). It soon afterwards became
a city of refuge, falling to the lot of the children of Aaron (Jos., xx,
7, xxi, 11, 13; I Par., vi, 55, 57). After the death of Saul on Mount Gelboe,
David went to Hebron with his men, and occupied all the surrounding villages
(II Kings, ii, 1, 3). He was there anointed King of Juda; made Hebron his
capital, and reigned there seven years and a half (II Kings, ii, 11, iii,
2, 5, v, 5; III Kings, ii, 11; I Par., iii, 1, 4; and xxix, 27). Abner,
the leader of Saul's army, came to Hebron to see David, was well received
by him, but was afterwards killed by Joab. The king wept over Abner, gave
him burial, and composed a lament over him (II Kings, iii, 19-iv, 1). It
was also to Hebron that Baana and Rechab, chiefs of the bands of Isboseth,
brought the head of that son of Saul whom they had traitorously slain.
David ordered the murderers to be put to death; their hands and feet were
cut off, and hanged up over the pool in Hebron (II Kings, iv, 2-12). Then
all the tribes of Israel came and made submission to David (II Kings, v,
1-3; I Par., xi, 1-3). When Absalom revolted against his father, who had
then become King of Jerusalem, it was Hebron he made his headquarters (II
Kings, xv, 7-11). The town was fortified by Roboam (II Par., xi, 10). Cariath-Arbe
is also mentioned among the towns occupied by the children of Juda after
the captivity (II Esd., xi, 25). Under Syrian domination, it passed into
the hands of the Idumeans; Judas Machabeus, who drove them out, razed the
fortifications of Chebron (I Mach., v, 65).
</p><center>
<p><b>CHRISTIAN EPOCH</b></p></center>

<p>Some writers, following Baronius, Papebroch, Cornelius a Lapide, and
Matth. Polus, have identified Hebron as the city of Juda where the Visitation
took place, and where St. John the Baptist was born. They hold that Hebron
was the most important of the towns of Juda, since Jerusalem belonged to
Benjamin; and that, moreover, Hebron was the most important of the Levitical
towns belonging to the sons of Caath, from whom came Zachary, father of
the Precursor. However there is fairly strong local tradition in favour
of identifying the "city of Juda" with Carem, the modern Ain-Karim (see
C<font size="-1">AREM</font>; Heidet in Vig., "Dict. de la Bible", s. v.
Carem; and Meistermann, "La partrie de S. Jean Baptiste"). At the time
of the great Jewish rebellion, Simon ben Giora captured Hebron from the
Romans; but the town was soon retaken, shortly before the siege of Jerusalem,
by Cerealis, one of Vespasian's generals, who ravaged it with fire and
sword (Josephus, "Bel. Jud.", IV, ix, 7-9). It was with great difficulty
that Hebron ever recovered. Eusebius (Onomast., s. v. <i>’Arbó</i>)
tells us that in his day (fourth century) it was merely a large hamlet;
but the neighbourhood has always been dear to pagans, Jews, and Christians
alike (Eusebius, "Vita Constantini", III, li, lii, in P. G. XX, 1112-1117;
Socrates, "Hist Eccl.", in P. G. LXVII, 124; Sozomen, "Hist. Eccl.", in
P. G. LXVII, 941-946). Even the Mussulmans held it dear by reason of its
many Scriptural associations, especially the apparition of the angels to
Abraham, and because it contains the tomb of the patriarchs. This tomb
is mentioned by Josephus (loc. cit.; "Ant.", I, 14), by Eusebius (Onomasticon,
loc. cit.), by the Pilgrim of Bordeaux in 333, and by visitors of after-ages,
as a sanctuary held in the highest reverence. At the time of the Arab conquest
in 637, Hebron, for all these reasons, was chosen as one of the four holy
cities of Islam. Previously Khusrau (614), the Persian king, had spared
it in deference to the Jews of whom there were many in his army. Eusebius,
Socrates, and Sozomen (loc. cit.) relate that Constantine ordered a church
to be built at Mambre, with the object of putting an end to the superstitious
practices that took place there every year during a semi-religious fair.
But we do not know at what epoch a basilica was first built over the cave
of Machpelah. It is certain that the Crusaders took the town in 1100, and
that the sanctuary became the church of Saint Abraham, also called the
church of the Holy Cave (Sancta Caverna or Spelunca, <i>’ágion spelaîon</i>).
The town itself is often styled by the chroniclers of that period Castel
Saint-Abraham, Præsidium or Castellum ad Sanctum Abraham. A priory
of Canons Regular of St. Augustine was installed to take charge of the
basilica (de Rozière, "Cartulaire du Saint-Sépulchre", 120,
142, etc., 171).
</p><p>A curious document relating to the medieval period and taken from a
fifteenth-century manuscript, is found in the "Recueil des historiens des
croisades" (Hist. Occid., V, 302-316) under the heading: "Canonici Hebronensis
tractatus de inventione sanctorum patriarcharum Abraham, Ysaac et Jacob"
[see Riant, "Invention de la sépulture des patriarches … à
Hébron, le 25 juin 1119", in "Archives de l'Orient latin", II (1883),
411-421; also "Acta SS.", Oct., IV, 683-691; and "Analecta Bollandiana",
XX (1901), 464]. This story seems to be founded on fact; two Arab historians,
who may have lived contemporaneously, mention such a discovery (Recueil
des Hist. des Croisades, op. cit., p. 64).
</p><p>Its most interesting historical materials are: a description of the
sanctuary existing on the site of the tombs before the coming of the Franks;
the sending of an embassy from Constantinople to Palestine by Theodosius
the Younger, about 415, to bring back the bodies of the three patriarchs,
and the failure of this attempt; the existence of a synagogue at Hebron
at the time of the First Crusade; the spoliation of the sanctuary at Hebron
between 1099 and 1102 by a Latin archbishop, probably Pierre de Narbonne,
transferred from the See of Alban to that of Apamea between 1112 and 1119.
A reference is made, at the year 1119, to Rainier, prior of Hebron, and
to two monks, Odo and Arnulph, who gave the anonymous writer the facts
he relates; mention is also made of Baudouin, seigneur of Saint-Abraham;
Guermond, Patriarch of Jerusalem (d. 1128); and a description occurs of
the sepulchral crypt where the bodies of the patriarchs lay. In 1167 Hebron
became a Latin see; its first titular was Rainaldus (1167-1170), nephew
of the patriarch Foucher (Du Cange, "Families d'outremer", 794).
</p><p>A letter of Clement IV, dated 1 June, 1267, orders the Patriarch of
Jerusalem to supply the church of Hebron with a priest (Eubel, "Hierarchia
Catholica", I, 283). After Geoffrey (Gaufridus), O.P., 1273-1283, the bishops
of Hebron were merely titulars, and a great confusion existed in their
list (Lequien, "Oriens Christ.", III, 639-642, 1269-1270; Gams, "Series
episc.", 435; Eubel, op. cit., I, 283, II, 180). Cardinal Mermillod was
at one time Titular of Hebron. The titular at present is Monsignor Petkoff,
Vicar Apostolic of the Uniat Bulgarians in Thrace, who resides at Adrianople.
As a residential see, Hebron enjoyed a very brief existence. However it
survived the triumph of Saladin in 1187, and the march of the Kharesmian
hordes in 1244. Saladin, after the victory at Hattin (15 July, 1187), and
that at Ascalon (5 September), hastened, before marching on Jerusalem,
to occupy Hebron, and to associate the sanctuary of Abraham with the worship
of Islam. The Kharesmians destroyed the town, but did not touch the sanctuary
(Riant, "Archives", II, 420-421).
</p><p>In spite of Mohammedan fanaticism, which since the fourteenth century
had forbidden a non-Mussulman to enter the hallowed place (Isaac Chelo,
1334, "Les chemins de Jérusalem, in Carmoly, "Itinéraires",
243), the schismatic Greeks, after the departure of the Latins, retained
for a time a residing bishop in Hebron. Lequien (III, 641-642) mentions
one of these bishops, Joannikios, whose name appears with that of Christodoulos
of Gaza in the Acts of the Council of Jerusalem in 1672 (Mansi, XXXIV B,
1771) under the title of
<i>Ioannikíou toû theophilestátou
’archiepiskópou toû ‘agíon spelaíon</i> (Joannikios,
most holy Archbishop of the holy Cave). Among the other signatories (ibid.,
1174) were two priests of the same church, George and Isas, both of whom
describe themselves as <i>‘iereùs toû ‘agíou spelaíou</i>
(priest and servant of the holy Cave). This Greek see did not last long;
and it is not mentioned in the notice of Chrysanthus, Patriarch of Jerusalem,
1707-1731. In 1834, after defeating, near the Pools of Solomon, the inhabitants
of Hebron who had risen against his authority, Ibrahim Pasha took their
town by assault.
</p><p>Hebron is to-day one of the principal towns of Palestine. It is about
twenty-four miles to the south of Jerusalem, is the residence of a kaimakam,
and has a population of 20,000, of whom 2000 are Jews of German, Spanish,
or Portuguese origin; the remainder are Mussulman fanatics. Its Arab name,
<i>El-Khalil,</i>
signifies "the friend of God", and calls to mind Abraham who is given that
appellation in James, ii, 23. The town is picturesquely situated at about
3000 feet above the sea, on a narrow plateau among the hills of Judea.
Its only monument of interest is the "Holy Enclosure" (Haram-el-Khalil),
within which stands the mosque over the burial cave of Machpelah. The Haram
is in the form of a rectangular parallelogram about 200 feet long, by 120
broad, and 50 to 60 feet high. The walls are adorned with many pilasters,
and are built of enormous rough stones. The style of the construction belongs
to the time when the crypts of the Haram at Jerusalem were built, and seems
Roman in character. The modern mosque is built on the site of an ancient
basilica restored by the Crusaders (La Palestine, Guide historique et pratique,
par des professeurs de N. D. de France à Jérusalem, p. 268).
The sacred enclosure is one of the finest relics of ancient architecture
in Palestine, and has been admired since the time of the Pilgrim of Bordeaux
(fourth century). In the opinion of many it is of Jewish origin and dates
from the time of the kings of Juda (cf. Legendre in Vig., "Dict. de la
Bible", s. v. Hébron). Consult Riant, "Archives", II, 412, for a
list of the few travellers who, during the nineteenth century, were able
to visit this sanctuary so fanatically guarded by the Mussulmans. In 1862
the present King of England, then Prince of Wales, and in 1869 the Crown
Prince of Prussia, later Frederick III, were among the visitors. The trade
of the town is much the same as in all Arab countries. The comparative
fertility of the soil and an abundance of water contribute to increase
this trade, which consists mainly in the making of goat-skin water bags,
jars, and especially glass ware for which, for centuries, Hebron has used
a soda extracted from the trans-Jordan regions. The vineyards around the
town are very fine; they belong mainly to the Jews who trade in dried raisins,
and manufacture a syrup and an excellent wine known as Hebron wine. Of
late years the Russians have contrived to get a foothold at El-Khalil,
and they have now a hostelry at the entrance to the town.

The Hebron Massacres</h3></center>
Hebron witnessed many acts of violence in this century, three of them are
worth mentioning here:
<p>1994 Abraham Mosque Massacre: An American born, American educated Jewish
physician; Dr. Goldstein; armed himself with various types of weapons and
grenades and ambushed Muslims in the Abraham Mosque while they knelt praying.
Twenty nine people were killed on the same day in Hebron, and more than
20 people were killed all over the West Bank and Gaza while protesting
the massacre. Sixteen more people died later of wounds incurred during
the protests.
</p><p>1982 Hebron University Massacre: A group of settlers from the settlement
of Kiryat Arba attacked the campus of Hebron University with automatic
machine guns and grenades. Four students died on the scene and two more
died later of their wounds. Dozens of students were wounded; and some remain
totally impaired.
