The Story of the Cave's Purchase 
The Names (Al Khalil, Hevron, Hebron, Arbo, Kiriath Arba) 
Why Hebron is important to Jews and Muslims. 
</p><p>
The Story of the Cave's Purchase 
Abraham, peace be upon him, bought the cave. While this matter is irrelevant to the history of the city, it should be told this way to demonstrate the entire story of "purchasing the city or part of it." So for those who use the skewed logic of seizing private properties from our people nowadays under the pretense that Abraham, peace be on him, purchased the cave in Hebron, we say that they owe the equivalent of this Cave and one and a half like it. 

The bible tells that Abraham, peace be on him, purchased the Cave for the full market price of 400 silver shekel [Tanach - Genesis Chapter 23: 16. And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, current money among the merchants.]  But two chapters earlier in Genesis, the bible tells that the king of the land, Abimelech, gave Abraham and his wife, Sarah, peace be on them, one thousand pieces of silver  [Tanach - Genesis Chapter 20:16. And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold, he is to you a covering of the eyes, to all who are with you, and with all other; thus she was reproved. 





Names of the City:- 

Ancient Canaanite name:- Arbo'a which is derived from the word "four." It is believed that the city was called so because it is surrounded by four main mountains. 

Present Arabic:- Al Khalil means "the friend." The city was named after Prophet Abraham who was called "Khalil" in the Quran [i.e. 4:125 Who can be better in religion than one who submits his whole self to Allah, does good, and follows the way of Abraham the true in faith? For Allah did take Abraham for a friend.] 

Ancient and present Hebrew: Hevron the word is highly related to the words "Haver and Havror" in Hebrew which mean "Friend." 

Ancient Hebrew:- Kiriath Arba means "the suburb of four." 
The Jewish holy scriptures say that the this name was given because four couples (Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Jacob and Leah, and Isaac and Rebecca were buried there. 

Talmud - Mas. Sotah 13a 
And there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation.7 It has been taught: Even the horses and asses [joined in the lamentation]. When [the cortege] arrived at the Cave of Machpelah, Esau came and wished to prevent [the interment there], saying to them, Mamre, Kiriath-arba, the same is Hebron8 — now R. Isaac has said: Kiriath-arba [is so called] because four couples [were buried there], viz. Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, and Jacob and Leah — [Jacob] had buried Leah in his portion and what remains belongs to me’. They replied to him, ‘Thou didst sell it’. He said to them, ‘Granted that I sold my birth-right, but did I sell my plain heir's right!’ 

Hebron. The English name of the city derived from the Hebrew name Hevron. 



Why Hebron is important to Jews and Muslims 

For Muslims 

For Muslims, Hebron is holy because it has the Magarat (Cave, Colloquial Gar) where Muslims believe that Abraham was buried. To Muslims, Abraham, is called the father of all the prophets. Muslims cannot be Muslims without the absolute belief in the prophecies of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as well as the Torah as the word of God. In the holy Muslim book, the Quran, Abraham, Jacob and Isaac were named 73, 18 and 16 times, respectively as opposed to only 4 times for the prophet of Islam, Muhammad. 

Jews revere the Cave for the same reason. 




Hebron, 

Arabic AL-KHALIL, in full AL-KHALIL AR-RAHMAN ("The Beloved of [God] the Merciful" [a reference to Abraham]), Hebrew HEVRON, city in the southern Judaean Hills, south-southwest of Jerusalem. It is 3,050 feet (930 m) above sea level. In modern times, it was part of mandated Palestine during 1923-48; after the Arab-Israeli War of 1948-49, it was in the territory annexed by Jordan (1950); since the Six-Day War of June 1967, it has been part of the West Bank (Judaea and Samaria) territory under Israeli administration. 

Hebron is one of the oldest cities in the region; because of its associations with the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and with King David, it is one of the four holy cities of Judaism (Jerusalem, Hebron, Tiberias, and Zefat [Safed]). Islam, which reveres Abraham as a founder of monotheism and precursor of Muhammad, also considers it a holy city. 

An ancient Canaanite royal city, Hebron was founded "seven years before Zoan in Egypt" (Numbers 13:22), and Zoan, later Tanis, the capital of the Hyksos invaders, has been dated to the 18th century BC. Abraham, founder of the Jewish people, long lived in Hebron, which was often referred to as Qiryat Arba' (Hebrew: "City of the Four," or "Tetrapolis"), possibly referring to four confederated settlements in the area in biblical times, or to the fact that the city is built on four hills. At Hebron, Abraham purchased the cave of Mach-pelah as a burial place for his wife, Sarah, from Ephron the Hittite (Genesis 23); this became a family sepulchre. According to tradition, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with their wives Sarah, Rebekah, and Leah, were buried in the cave. After the exodus from Egypt, Hebron was one of the cities visited by the spies sent by Moses. Later, Joshua fought the Battle of Aijalon, where "the sun stood still," against a confederation of Amorite chiefs including the "king of Hebron" (Joshua 10). 

King David (c. 10th century BC) was ordered by God to go to Hebron; he was anointed king of Israel there, and made it his capital for 7 1/2 years, until the taking of Jerusalem (II Samuel 2-5). In post-exilic times Hebron fell to the Edomites; King Herod the Great (ruled 37-4 BC) built a wall around the cave of Mach-pelah, portions of which survive beneath additions by Byzantines, crusaders, and Mamluks. The Muslims ruled the city from AD 635 until after World War I, except for 1100-1260, when the crusaders controlled it. 

In the early 20th century, Hebron was a Muslim Arab city, with a small, old Jewish community, largely of pious seminarians. In the Arab riots of 1929, 67 Hebron Jews were massacred; the remainder of the community left the city after the beginning of the Arab uprising of 1936-39. 

Modern Hebron is an agricultural marketing and trade centre, with glass and leather manufactures. The Cave of Mach-pelah (Hebrew Me'arat ha-Makhpela) is surmounted by a large mosque, al-Haram al-Ibrahimi al-Khalil (The Sanctuary of Abraham, the Friend). After the Six-Day War (1967), the tombs of the patriarchs were opened to all worshippers for the first time in exactly 700 years, the original prohibition against non-Muslims having been made by the Mamluk sultan Baybars in 1267. Both Muslim and Jewish services are now held in the cave; the upper mosque remains the exclusive property of the Muslims. In 1968 Orthodox settlers renewed Jewish presence in the city; their presence was finally approved by the Israeli government in 1970, and a new housing project for them was built in the early 1970s. Many tourists and pilgrims visit the Cave of Mach-pelah and other sites connected with the lives of the patriarchs, such as Abraham's Oak (Hebrew, Eshel Avraham), just northwest of the city. Pop. (1984 est.) 75,000.
