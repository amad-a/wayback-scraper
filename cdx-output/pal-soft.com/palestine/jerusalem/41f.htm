Several  Palestinians  towns were coming under heavy artillery bombardment.
Hundreds  of Palestinian houses and residential buildings were partially or
completely destroyed by Israeli bombardment.

A  Palestinian boy Ahmad Kaffash (11 years old), were killed by hit and run
car  accident  by  Israel settler when the boy was standing at the roadside
when  a car with Israeli license plates deliberately drove at him on a main
highway outside Nablus.

In  Bethlehem,  Ahmed  Abdullah  Amarneh  (24 year old) was shot dead by an
Israeli  sniper  stationed  at  garrison  outposts near the Bilal Ibn Rabah
Mosque.

Said  Abu  Khathleh  (16  years  old),  from Gaza, succumbed to the serious
injuries  he sustained last Friday during clashes with the Israeli soldiers
near Deir al Balah.

Tariq Taleb al Hajjar , from Salfit, was carried to hospital unconscious as
he was beaten on the head savagely by a number of Jewish settlers.

Here are some photos of today :
