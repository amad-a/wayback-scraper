Heavily  armed  Israeli  occupation soldiers shot five Palestinians dead in
clashes throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

The  Palestinian  martyrs  are:  Wa’el  Said Eghneim (28 years old) from al
Khader  near  Bethlehem,  Muhammed  Mahmud al Hurub (27 years old) from Dir
Samet  near  al  Khalil,  Muhammed  Ibrahim  Hajaj  (17 years old) from the
Shujaiya  neighborhood,  Ahmed  Salman Tayeh (15 years old) from Gaza town,
and Ibrahim Reziq Umar (14 years old) from the Shate’ refugee camp in Gaza.

The  death  total  of  Al-Aqsa  Intifada  reached 155 martyrs and over 5500
injured.

The  Israeli  occupation  army  closed off several Palestinian towns in the
central  and  northern  regions of the West Bank. In Nablus, ambulances and
paramedics  were  barred  from  either entering or leaving Nablus, the West
Bank’s largest town.

Earlier,  Israeli  troops  raided  the  village  of 'Seileh Harthiyye' near
Nablus where clashes with local villagers continued for several hours.

Israeli  occupation army has stepped up artillery and aerial bombardment of
Palestinian  population  centers  throughout  the  West  Bank, causing many
casualties and inflicting heavy damage.

The  towns of Bethlehem, Beit Jala, Ayda refugee camp, Tulkarm and Ramallah
were coming under heavy bombardment.

The   village  of  al-Khader  was  earlier  subjected  to  heavy  artillery
bombardment  and  helicopter  strafing,  resulting  in scores of casualties
among the civilian population.

In clashes before the aerial bombardment , Two Israeli soldiers were killed
and five were injured, one seriously.

At  least two Palestinians were killed by machinegun rounds fired by attack
helicopters.  The  two  were identified as Wael Said Ighneim (28 years old)
and Muhammed Ahmed Hurub (27 years old) a policeman.

Here are some Photos of today :
