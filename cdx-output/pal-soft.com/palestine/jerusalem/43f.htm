Israeli  occupation  troops have been firing machinegun fire on Palestinian
civilians in Nablus.

Israeli  soldiers confiscated the olive crops from many Palestinian farmers
in  the Nablus area. One farmer was quoted as saying that "they stopped us,
seized the harvested crops, and then ordered us not to return our fields."

Israeli helicopter gunships pounded Palestinian targets in the town of Beit
Sahur  ,  killing  three  persons,  among  them  two  housewives.  A  Cobra
Helicopter  gunship  fired  a  rocket  at  a  civilian  car, in which Fatah
official  Hussein  Abayat was riding, killing him instantly, two women died
in  the  incident,  Aziza Dannoun (57 years old) and Rahma Shahin (52 years
old)  .Four  more  people, including a paramedic and a nurse, were injured,
one seriously injured.

In  Khan  Younis, Muhammed Kamel Shurrab was hit with a bullet in the back,
piercing his heart muscle, exiting his chest.

Here are some photos of today :
