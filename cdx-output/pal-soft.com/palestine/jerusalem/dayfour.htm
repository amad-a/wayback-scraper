The total of Palestinian martyrs since Friday was 32 and that over 700
wounded,  about  80  of whom sustained serious gun-shot wounds. 50% of
the  casualties  were  below  the  age  of  18, adding that 55% of the
injuries  were caused by live munitions and internationally-prohibited
bullets  of  the Dom-Dom category, which explode after penetrating the
body causing further damage to body tissues.

Israel  soldiers  and  settlers  started  to  target  journalists  and
cameramen  covering  the  continuing  unrest in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip ,they shot and seriously wounded two local cameramen working for
two  foreign  news agencies. Amer al Ja’abari, 30, a cameraman working
for  ABC,  was  shot in the forehead with a steel bullet his condition
was  described  as  serious . Another cameramen, Mazen Da’ana, 37, was
also  injured in the chest by live ammunition his condition was listed
also as serious.

Tens  of  thousands  of  Palestinians  in the Jewish state took to the
streets to show solidarity with their Palestinian brothers in the West
Bank  and  Gaza  Strip . In several instances, the Israeli police used
live ammunitions against Arab protesters inside the Jewish state.

At  least  eight anti-tank missiles were fired at a Palestinian police
garrison  outpost  near  Gaza.  Two  Palestinians were killed and over
seventy injured during clashes with Zionist troops.
