Four  Palestinian  university students civilians were killed and eight were
seriously  injured  when  an  Israeli  tank  opened fire on two Palestinian
passenger  cars  in  the  Gaza  Strip. The four are Jamal Abdul Qader, Awni
Ismael, Khalil Sha’er and Nayel Shehdeh. The Wife of one of the martyrs was
also  seriously  wounded. The Israeli army prevented Palestinian ambulances
from taking the wounded to hospitals in Gaza.

Meanwhile,  Israeli  helicopter gunships began bombing selective targets in
Rafah and Khan Younes.

In  a car bomb blast in Khadera north of Tel Aviv, two people killed and at
least  25  injured  five  of  them  listed  in serious condition and one in
critical condition.

Two  schools  were  vacated  after  school children found a small explosive
device in the school yard.

The  Israeli  army  dismantled  the  wholesale  vegetable  market in Hebron
apparently to please the Jewish settlers .

Jewish settlers attacked Arab villages in the central and northern parts of
the West Bank, injuring several Palestinian civilians and vandalizing their
fields.  Near  the  village  of  Ein  Yabrud, near Ramallah, armed settlers
opened  fire  on  a  group  of  Palestinians  injuring two of them. Another
Palestinian  was seriously injured at the village of “Seilet Althaher” near
Jenin  when  armed settlers fired at Palestinians who were harvesting their
olives.

An  official  Jordanian declared that Amman had decided to continue with an
earlier  decision  not  to  send  its  ambassador to Tel Aviv until further
notice.

Here are some photos of today :

Investigators  examine  the  scene  of  a  car  bomb  blast in Khadera. The
explosion  in northern Israel injured at least 25 people during rush hour ,
not  long  after  Israeli  soldiers  killed four Palestinians at a military
roadblock in the Gaza Strip. (Photo 1)

Two  Palestinian civil vehicles which were shot at by Israeli army soldiers
near  the  Morag  Jewish  settlement  in Gaza Strip. Four Palestinians were
killed in the Israeli shooting. (Photo 2)

An   Israeli   army   bulldozer,  clears  Palestinian  trees  away  from  a
intersection  near Gush Katif junction in the Gaza Strip. Israeli tanks and
armored  personnel carriers were brought into the Gaza Strip, cutting it in
two  and  preventing  Palestinian traffic between its northern and southern
parts. (Photo 3)

Israeli  soldiers tear-down a Palestinian vegetable market in the West Bank
town of Hebron for security reasons as they claim. (Photo 4)
