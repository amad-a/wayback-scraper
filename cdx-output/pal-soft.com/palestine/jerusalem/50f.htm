Israeli  helicopter gunshots attacked several Palestinian towns last night,
inflicting  heavy  damage,  killing  a  German  Doctor and injuring fifteen
Palestinians.  Harry Fisher, a physiotherapist, was hit with shrapnel of an
Israeli  shell  while  trying to give first aid to wounded neighbors at the
town of Beit Jala near Bethlehem. He died instantly.

Israeli  occupation and settlers have destroyed and uprooted as many as ten
thousand  grown  olive  trees in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip since the
outbreak  of  al-Aqsa  intifada  on 28 September. On Wednesday, the Israeli
army  destroyed  over  400  dunums  of orchards, including citrus and olive
trees, in the Gaza Strip.

Here are some photos of today :

Palestinian  mourners  carry  the  bodies  of  20-year-old  Ahmed Basal and
16-year-old Mohammad Al-Shrafi through the streets of Gaza City for burial.
Both  were  shot dead Wednesday during clashes with Israeli soldiers at the
Carni border crossing. (Photo 1)

guarding the Gush Katif settlements near Khan Yunis in the southern part of
the Gaza Strip. (Photo 2)

Israeli  army  gunfire  from the Gilo neighborhood in south Jerusalem pours
into  the  Palestinian  town  of Beit Jala in the West Bank. Several people
were  injured  and a German civilian was killed in the fighting as protests
marked  the  12th  anniversary  of  Arafat's  symbolic  declaration  of  an
independent state from exile in 1988. (Photo 3)
