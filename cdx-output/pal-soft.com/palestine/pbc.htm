      <p align="LEFT">The experimental transmission of the Voice of Palestine 
        started on the second of July 1994. President yasser Arafat started the 
        transmission addressing his people for the first time from his homeland 
        through the Palestinian radio.</p>
      <p align="LEFT">The transmission started over two periods. The morning period 
        from 6:30 to 10:30 and the evening period, from 5:00 to 10:30.</p>
      <p align="LEFT">The experimental transmission included musical programs, 
        songs, news bulletins in addition to health, culture, and sports programs 
        and the frequently 675 kHz assigned for the transition of vop programs.</p>
      <p align="LEFT">In the beginning of October 1994, the experimental transmission 
        of the Voice of Palestine was stopped. The official transmission started 
        with news bulletins and locally produced programs.</p>
      <p align="LEFT">The radio transmission period was extended on the 15th of 
        November 1994. The extended period ranged between 6:30 AM to 3:00 PM and 
        from 5:00 PM to 10:30 PM.</p>
      <p align="LEFT">By the end of January 1995, the radio transmission was extended 
        a second time from 6:30 AM to midnight.</p>
      <p align="LEFT">On the third of April 1995 the Palestinian Broadcasting 
        Corporation received the old radio transmission site in Ramallali. The 
        PBC has installed all the administrative and technical structures into 
        the old radio transmission site.</p>
      <p align="LEFT"><b>On </b>the third of April 1996, the Voice of Palestine 
        started broadcasting from the central Studios of the Palestinian Broadcasting 
        Corporation in Ramallali, After 21 months of transmission from Jericho.</p>
      <p align="LEFT"> <b>On </b>the 13<sup>th</sup> of March 1996, the Voice 
        of Palestine started for the first time to transmit in three foreign Languages: 
        English, Hebrew, and French. The foreign program included news bulletins, 
        interviews, commentaries and songs. Again, on the first of June 1996, 
        the transmission of the Voice of Palestine was extended until 1:00 after 
        midnight.</p>
      <p align="LEFT">The professional and administrative structure in the Voice 
        of Palestine consists of the following departments:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p align="LEFT">1. General Administration.</p>
          <p align="LEFT">2. The Department of precarious.</p>
          <p align="LEFT">3. The News Department.</p>
          <p align="LEFT">4. The Engineering Department.</p>
          <p align="LEFT">The Palestinian radio station, through its programs, 
            aims at maintaining, the Palestinian identify and heritage of the 
            Palestinian life wether in the political, economic, social and cultural 
            level through daily and weekly programs. </p>
        </blockquote> 
          </blockquote>
        <blockquote> 
          <p align="LEFT">The Voice of Palestine is the outcome of the journalistic 
            and broadcasting experience of the professionals who work <b>in </b>the 
            fields of radio and information.</p>
        </blockquote>
  
      <p align="LEFT">The radio station has nearly 80 programs transmitted daily 
        and weekly. Some programs are live. The subject of these programs is political, 
        cultural, social, agricultural and developmental. In addition, there are 
        programs designed especially for children, women, Youth, and all aspects 
        of the Palestinian life.</p>
      <p align="LEFT">A number of Palestinian academics, ill addition to a well 
        qualified staff working at the radio station, produce these programs and 
        sometimes present them. The program cycle change every 3 months.</p>
      <p align="LEFT">The News Department basically covers the Palestine political 
        events in addition to the international and Arab events. These are transmitted 
        through news bulletins around the clock, and also through analytical news 
        programs that are transmitted daily either in the morning, afternoon or 
        in the evening.</p>
      <p align="LEFT">The foreign programs, English, French, and Hebrew aim at 
        reaching people who speak these languages either inside or outside Palestine.</p>
      <p align="LEFT">The Voice of Palestine is performing its national duty towards 
        its people. There is a strong cooperation between VOP and the national 
        and private institutions to produce and transmit programs directed to 
        different sectors of the Palestinian people. It addresses every thought 
        and ideology affiliated to Palestine, its population and government. Its 
        strategic objective is to establish and strengthen the roots of the Palestinian 
        people. These values are based on justice, freedom, democracy, pluralism 
        and peace in order to achieve the objectives of the nation: the independent 
        Palestinian state and its capital, Jerusalem.</p>
