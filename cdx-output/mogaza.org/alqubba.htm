    Al Qubba is a vicinity in Al Shigaia neighborhood in Gaza city. Shijaia is 
    one of the underprivileged districts in Gaza which has an area of 5,920 
    donums (a donum = 1000 m<sup>2</sup>) and about 58,000 residents. Shijaia has suffered, 
    as well as all neighborhoods of Gaza, from deliberate negligence during the 
    long 27 years of the Israeli occupation. As Shijaia is considered one of the 
    heavily populated neighborhoods in Gaza, the Municipality has given it a 
    priority in comprehensive development in order to face the many 
    environmental and social dangers due to the lack of proper infrastructure, 
    health, sports, education, and recreation facilities.<br>
    <br>
    During the past years the Municipality has directed many funds to upgrade 
    the Al Qubba neighborhood (with population of 17,480 citizens). New infrastructure as well as educational, 
    recreational, and health facilities were constructed or still under 
    construction but much more is still needed.<br>
    <br>
    As children are the leaders of tomorrow, the Municipality is keen to provide 
    recreational and educational facilities in order to help them spend their 
    free time in peaceful and productive healthy activities similar to other 
    children of the world. The Municipality also believes that, developing 
    public spaces will improve the sense of public property and lead to a more 
    harmonious town. At Shijaia neighborhood, no recreation facilities or green 
    areas for children exist. Dunkerque city, the French twin City of Gaza, 
    sponsored phase I and phase II for this park by donating funds to plant a 
    number of palm trees and performing some basic concrete works. Dunkerque was 
    the first town which signed an agreement of twining with Gaza in 1997. 
    Towards the end of 2002, the Municipality started launching a neighborhood 
    development project covering selected areas of the city including Al Qubba 
    Park Phase III. Works, procurement of equipment and external services 
    relating to that project is covered by a grant from AFD (Agence Francise de 
    Development). Mr. Michel Dellebare, Mayor of Dunkerque Urban Community has 
    shown interest in coming to Gaza at the end of the year 2003 for the 
    official inauguration of this Park.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Al Qubba Park (<a href="/mogaza.org/images/plan.jpg" style="pointer-events: none;">see map for location</a>) is considered an important element towards 
    the comprehensive development of the Shijaia neighborhood. The Municipality 
    places great importance to the development of public areas, which is 
    urgently needed, in Al Qubba neighborhood. The Park site was selected after 
    examining a series of potential locations in the area. The intentions are to 
    provide the neighborhood with public areas to complement the other projects 
    which was implemented or those are under construction or planned.</font></p>
