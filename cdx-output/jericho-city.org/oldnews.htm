<p align="JUSTIFY" dir="LTR">We send you our greetings from Jericho the land of 
peace in which Jesus Christ was baptized. we call upon you as the Israeli 
closure is seizing everything in the city of peace. Even children’s joy, grape 
fields, and the history and antiquities dating back to 10000 years in deep

<font size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY" dir="LTR">Back in the ancient times, they used to say that 
health is a crown placed on the heads of healthy men and visible only to ill 
people. Same in Palestine we say that Peace, security and stability is 
considered as a crown placed on the heads of tenths of states, that we in 
Palestine deeply appreciate and yearn for. Not for reasons of development, but 
for our survival and keeper of our lives.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" dir="LTR">I don’t know if you are aware to the fact that in 
the morning when fathers of Palestinian children start the day by attempting to 
attend their jobs that they may not return from usually reach their jobs after 
many hours of intentional insulting and humiliation taking place in the Israeli 
military checkpoints. This applies to school children, academic instructors, 
doctors, and patients.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" dir="LTR">Nowadays, in Europe the borders separating states 
are being removed, but in Palestine the Palestinian land is being divided into 
64 cantons as a result of 125 Israeli military checkpoints. Many years ago In 
Germany, people actually witnessed the demolishing of the Berlin wall, this wall 
was rebuilt in Palestine!!!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" dir="LTR">The Israelis are completely aware that these 
checkpoints are not being established for security reasons whereas if any group 
intended to carry out a military act in Israel will not in any case pass through 
these highly and strictly inspected checkpoints. The reason behind the 
establishment of these checkpoints is to increase the pressure on the 
Palestinian people through creating more sufferings and tortures.</p>

through the twinning relations established between Palestinian and international 
cities especially the European cities. This light that we are seeking is at the 
end of the dark tunnel, an outlet of hope by which we could ease the pressure 
and lessen the suffering of our people. fulfill some of its humanitarian needs 
from one side and inform the world about the brutality of the Israeli practices 
against our people and the real amount of suffering from another side. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" dir="LTR">We seek to mobilize the efforts of peace and 
freedom lovers to support our legitimate rights that are recognized by the 
United Nations.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" dir="LTR">We in Palestine consider Europe and specially the 
northern European countries to be at the head of this effort that in the end 
should lead to recognizing the lost rights and the implementation of the

with many other cities in signing the international Olympic games truce 
agreement. This ceremonial act was performed by the Mayor of Jericho Mr. Abdel- 
Karim Sider who signed the truce in 20-09-2003 in the international celebration 
that gathered a number of peace loving countries. The representatives of these 
countries participated in a conference held in the Greek capital in the period

gave a speech on behalf of his excellency Chairman Yassir Arafat who was denied 
from fulfilling the invitation to participate in this occasion as a result of

winner. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" dir="LTR">On the other hand, the Israeli delegation was 
absent and didn’t attend the conference which was received by resentment of the

Israeli government to sign and be committed to a truce.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" dir="LTR">It is worth mentioning that being committed to a 
truce during the Olympic games is an old Greek tradition followed through the 
decades for the purpose of enabling the athletes to attend the games and return

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Mayor of Jericho Mr.Abdel-Karim Sider, said that the 
whole idea of establishing the child Municipal Council in the city of Jericho 
was to practice democracy in reality, he also said that democracy couldn’t be 
taught but should be practiced in real life, and during practical experiences. 
And that our children should practice the experience of democratic elections 
that the Palestinian people were deprived of and democratic values should be 
implanted into them since early childhood.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr.Sider also stressed on the necessity of implanting 
principles of communal responsibility, participation, and belonging. These 
principles as he said are absent in the community lately. The idea of forming 
the child municipal council was a start to implant principles of participation 
of children in the local community and widening the intellectual abilities of 
children by encouraging reading and engaging in issues related to children.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr.Sider said that one of the main concerns and priorities of 
the of the child council is determining a set of messages to children and to all 
sectors of the community and working on implementing them on the ground. And 
working on organizing competitions to evaluate the extent to which these 
messages are being implemented.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This meeting organized by the municipality is considered a 
new mechanism in-order to allow the participation of parents in the municipal 
council activities and making them observe the accomplishments that had been 
made. Mr.Sider emphasized on the necessity of enhancing the relations between 
the parents and the Municipality. He said that parents should participate in the 
different activities, programs, and proposals submitted by the Municipality 
towards the child council. He proposed electing a special committee formed from 
the parents to follow- up the council and meet the rest of the parents and 
arrange other future meetings.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">From the other hand, the parents welcomed the idea of making 
such meetings and stressed on their will to participate in the activities 
conducted by the children and helping them to emanate new ideas.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">One of these suggestions that have been proposed by the 
parents was to form a special committee from the child council. To have 
relations and visit the education and governmental institutions, to illustrate 
ideas about the problems and concerns of children and to observe the policy 
taken by these institutions regarding children. And documenting them in-order to 
find a solution and insure the participation of the whole city institutions in 
the city in the process of development.</p>

role played by the municipality and its efforts to reach the best- results 
expected from the idea of establishing a child Municipal Council. They also

library in Jericho, a CD section in the Municipal library was officially opened

<br>
<b><font color="#008080">Project concept:</font></b><br>
The idea came up as there was a rising need among the young people in the city 
of Jericho of using Hi- Tec and a necessity of facilitating information access 
for everyone. Especially to an important group and that is children and youth, 
the municipality desire was to be in a leading position in the Information, 
Technology, and Computer Field. For this reason the administration thought that 
adding a CD section in the municipal library is an essential step, as this kind 
of tech<img border="0" src="/jericho-city.org/images/news.h5.jpg" align="left" width="240" height="156">nology 
is distinguished from any other being the language of the world. During a visit 
of the head of the information technology section to the city of Nantes in 
France within a cooperation program with French municipalities, the idea was 
proposed and adopted by the Jerusalem- Gaza Loirre association. This association 
kindly donated a sum of 15000 French Franks for implementing this project.<br>

copy of this damaged CD will be made in the Library, in the Future, the 
Municipality thinks of installing a digital lending system.<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#008080">Classification of the CDs:</font></b><br>
<img border="0" src="/jericho-city.org/images/news.h14.jpg" width="212" height="160" align="left">The CDs are classified according to the topic and programs. In accordance with a 
special classification system that was implemented by the Library personnel, a 
special colored sticker was fixed on the CD cover to indicate the topic it 
belongs to, which will help reaching the wanted CD.<br>
<br>
This step has made the Jericho Municipality a pioneer as the municipal library 
will be the only one in the city that offers such services, this section will 
help in expanding the intellectual capacities of children, students, and adults 
and will help in communicating information.<br>
<br>
<font color="#008080"><b>Future plans:</b></font><br>
<br>
As the Jericho Municipality has recently signed an agreement for the 
establishment of a new library with ANERA (Near east refugee Aid) project funded 
by USAID it is expected that such a CD section will be expanded more and will 
include more CD topics and specialized programs.</font></p>
