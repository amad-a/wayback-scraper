<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><font color="#408080"><a name="The Road to Jericho"><font size="+1"><b>The Road to Jericho</b></font> <br>
</a></font>There are a number of interesting historical sites on the main Jerusalem
Jericho road that one should not miss. The road runs though a semidesert area known
locally as Bariyet Al Quds "the wilderness of Jerusalem" or the Judaean Desert.
A semi-desert of about 500km2 lies here, it sustains no life except in the wadis. In
ancient times, monks and hermits came to meditate and pray in its silence. Today as in
ancient times, Bedouin tents and camps line the road. Lately, a couple of Israeli
settlements have sprung up in the desert. They obtain their water by digging very deep
wells that reach water beds, thus affecting the natural water flow down to Jericho. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#408080"><a name="Bethany (Al Ezariah)"><font size="+1"><b>Bethany
(Al Ezariah)</b></font> <br>
</a></font>Four km east of Jerusalem on the main Jerusalem-Jericho road is the Palestinian
village of Al Ezariah, home to the famous church of Bethany. The Arabic name of the
village is a derivation of the earlier Greek name Lazarus, who according to the New
Testament was raised from the dead by Jesus Christ. A chapel dedicated to Lazarus was
built on his tomb during the 4th century, and was replaced by a church during the Crusader
period. The church was later converted into a mosque, but in the 17th century it became a
church once again. The present church was built by the Roman Catholics in the 1950s.
Nearby is the Greek Orthodox Church with its beautiful blue dome. Visiting hours are from
8 to 11:30am and from 2 to 5pm. <br>
&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#408080"><a name="Al Khan Al Ahmar"><font size="+1"><b>Al
Khan Al Ahmar</b></font> <br>
</a></font>Ten (10) km east of Jerusalem, on the main road to Jericho, is AL Khan Al
Ahmar, also known as the Good Samaritan Inn. The Khan is a 16th century Ottoman structure
where travelers on this ancient trade route linking the two banks of the Jordan stopped to
refresh themselves and their animals. Today, a souvenir shop and a Bedouin tent serving
refreshments for tourists occupy the inn. On the opposite side of the road there are
visible but inaccessible remains of the church of St. Euthymius. Built in the 5th century,
it soon became one of the most important monastic centers in Palestine. The church was
built on the site to commemorate the famous story of the Good Samaritan who helped Jesus
on his return journey to Jerusalem. The name "the Good Samaritan Inn" is derived
from this source. It remained in use until the 13th century when it was destroyed by the
Mamluk sultan Baybars because it was on the pilgrimage route to Nabi Musa. The hill beyond
the Khan is occupied by the Israeli settlement of Ma'ale Edomim which was esablished in
1978 and is now a city. Israel plans to incorporate this settlement into what it calls
metropolitan Jerusalem. Visiting is possible all day long. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#408080"><a name="Wadi Qelt (Saint George Monastery)"><font size="+1"><b>Wadi Qelt (Saint George Monastery)</b></font> <br>
</a></font>Beyond the Khan, the road begins its descent towards the Jordan valley. Three
km after the Khan to the left is a narrow road leading to wadi Qelt and the monastery of
Saint George "Dair Al Qelt". The wadi is a natural rift in the hills with high,
sheer rock walls extending 45km between Jerusalem and Jericho. The narrow and difficult
road lining the wadi was once the main road to Jericho. It is now used only by tourists
visiting the monastery, the wadi, the springs, and the ancient water systems which were
probably the largest and the most interesting in the whole country. Hermits have inhabited
the wadi since the 3rd century AD. They initially lived in caves and rock-hollowed niches,
but in the AD 5th-6th centuries, they started building monasteries. Many such monasteries
were built here, only the monastery of Saint George survived. During the Persian invasion
of Palestine in AD 614, this monastery was destroyed and many of its monks were killed.
Skulls and mummies of the deceased are on display at the monatery. Most of the present
church dates from the 1901 restoration by the Greek Orthodox Church. The wadi is also
known as wonderful place for hiking tours, especially in winter. A 15km walking path has
been marked here, it starts at the springs of Qelt or Farah, down to the site of Tulul Abu
Al Alaieq (Herod's winter palace) in jericho. Visiting hours are from 9 to 12am and from 2
to 4pm. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#408080"><a name="Maqam Al Nabi Musa"><font size="+1"><b>Maqam
Al Nabi Musa</b></font> <br>
</a></font>The maqam of Nabi Musa is considered a holy place because it houses the grave
of prophet Moses according to local tradition. Moses is recognized by Moslems as one of
the great prophets of Islam. The bituminous rocks around the shrine add to its mystique
and sanctity since they are flammable. This remarkable property is due to their mineral
content of qatraan or tar, with its distinctive smell. Pilgrims used the stones as fuel
for warmth and cooking. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The tomb has been the site of annual pilgrimage festival or mawsim
at least since the time of the great Muslim leader Salah Al Din ( Saladin ) who liberated
Jerusalem from the Crusaders in the twelfth century AD. Muslims believe that Moses is
buried here, although, according to the Old Testament (Deuteronomy 34), Moses never
entered Palestine, the ''Promised Land'', but rather died at Mount Nebo in modern-day
Jordan. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The main body of the present shrine-the mosque, minaret, and some of
the rooms - was completed in AD 1269 during the reign of the Mamluk Sultan, Al Thaher
Baybars who reigned from AD 1260 to 1277. Baybars bequeathed a huge religious
endowment-Waqf of agricultural land and villages to support the maqam, including Turmus
Aiya, al-Mazara'a, Khirbet Abu Falah, Sur Baher, and the lands and waters of Wadi Qilt and
Jericho. In later periods, more land and villages from the Nablus region and Ajlun were
added to the waqf, making it the largest in the whole of Palestine. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Successive additions of rooms for visitors and pilgrims brought the
maqam to its present shape and size in AD 1475. Further major maintenance and restorations
were undertaken by the Ottoman rulers in 1820, this is documented by an inscription above
the main western entrance of the maqam. </font></p>

<p><strong><em><font face="Arial">The mawsim of Nabi Musa </font></em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">The development of the annual pilgrimage and festival of Nabi' Musa
  goes back to the time of the liberation of Jerusalem by Saladin from the crusaders. As a
  show of Muslim strength and good will to the Christians, Saladin allowed, under the terms
  of the agreement, the Crusades and another Western pilgrims to visit the Christian holy
  places at Easter time. That is the reason why the pilgrims and festival of Nabi Musa falls
  always on the week proceeding Easter. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">From that time on, thousand of Muslims from all over Palestine made
  it their habit to come to Jerusalem on Good Friday. They prayed in Al-Aqsa Mosque and then
  marched in grand procession, singing religious songs, dancing the traditional dabkeh, and
  playing flutes and drums until they reached the maqam. Prayers, celebrations, horse racing
  and games continued for five days around the shrine. This has developed over the years to
  became one of the most attractive and popular festivals in Palestine. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The mawsim is a religious occasion but it is also a time for
  celebration and relaxation. It was an important social event too, since it brought
  together Palestinians from all parts of the country who met, discussed their affairs,
  forged links with one another and planned joint activities. Delegations came from as far
  away as Haifa, Nablus, Jaffa, Hebron and Jerusalem, and other towns and villages in
  Palestine. The political significance of such a huge gathering was demonstrated during the
  1920s and 1930s. Tens of thousands of Palestinians at the mawsim of Nabi Musa demonstrated
  against Zionist immigration and settlement in Palestine, and against the British mandate
  authorities who supported it. In 1930s, the British army was called in to quell
  demonstrations at the site, and in 1937, the British banned celebrations at the maqam
  completely. Annual pilgrimage was resumed only in 1987, when 50.000 Palestinians attended
  a mawsim organized by the Muslim Waqf in Jerusalem after a break of 50 years. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">This was stopped by the Israeli arbitrary measures against the
  Palestinian people during the Intifadah period ( 1987-1995 ). The Committee for the
  Promotion of Tourism in the Governorate of Jericho in cooperation with the Palestinian
  Ministry of Waqf and Religious Affairs revived under the patronage of President Yasser
  Arafat in 1997 this mawsim and pilgrimage. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em><font face="Arial">Description of the Site: </font></em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">The maqam represents Islamic architecture in its simplest and best
  form. It is a huge three story building topped by a complex of domes. The building
  consists of a large central open courtyard surrounded by over 120 rooms and halls. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The main mosque, with a minaret, lies against the western wall of
  the courtyard. Inside, there is a mihrab or prayer niche pointing in the direction of
  Mecca, and it is a minbar or pulpit from which the Imam traditionally leads the prayers. A
  wall with a large opening divides the mosque into two parts: the large eastern section is
  designated for men, while the smaller western part is for women. To the right of the main
  entrance of the mosque, another door leads to a small chamber in the center of which is a
  tomb covered with green cloth, that is the burial place of the Prophet Moses. On the wall,
  in Arabic a Mamluk inscription reads: " The construction of this maqam over the grave
  of the prophet who spoke with God, Moses, is ordered by his majesty, Sultan Taher Abu Al
  Fatah Baybars, in the year 668 hijra" ( AD 1269/70 ). The title, Abu Al Fatah,
  meaning " The Conqueror ", was given to Baybars since he liberated Palestine
  from the Crusaders. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Outside the mosque, the fine minaret affords a wonderful panoramic
  view of the shrine, the Jordan valley and the desert hills beyond. On a clear day, one can
  also catch sight of the Hills of Moab on the eastern bank of the Jordan River and Mount
  Nebo which biblical tradition associates with Moses. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The huge cemetery outside the walls of the shrine is for Muslims who
  either died during the festivals or who asked to be buried here because of the sanctity of
  the site. According to the local tradition, the cemetery includes two important tombs over
  which two small maqams have been built: the larger one, about one kilometer west of Nabi
  Mussa, is held by local tradition to be that of Hassan Al-Ra'i, the shepherd of the
  Prophet Moses, although records show him to have been a guardian of the maqam in the
  nineteenth century. Unfortunately, this maqam has been vandalized in recent years. The
  second tomb, to the southeast, is that of A'isha, a righteous local woman. First mention
  of this maqam of A'isha appeared in 1920. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em><font face="Arial">The maqam today </font></em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">The 1937 ban on the mawsim of Nabi Musa continued and the shrine was
  used as military base under Jordanian rule and by the Israelis until 1973 when it was
  handed back to the Islamic Waqf in Jerusalem. It resumed once in 1987 but was stopped by
  the Israelis at the outbreak of the Palestinian Intifada against the occupation which
  started in December of that year. The Oslo Accord of 1992 between Israel and the PLO
  placed the sanctuary under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Ministry of the Islamic
  Waqf. Major reconstruction and restoration works need to be carried out. The PNA assigned
  a Committee for that purpose. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">A Palestinian family from Jericho lives on the site and looks after
  it, they are happy to show visitors around. They run a small shop selling interesting and
  unusual gifts, such as pure olive-oil soap, honey and locally-produced olive oil, the
  proceeds of which go towards maintaining the site. Soft drinks and snacks are also
  available. They sanctuary is open daily from 8 until sunset, no entrance fee is required,
  but donations towards its upkeep are welcome. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em><font face="Arial">location </font></em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">Maqam Al-Nabi Musa, or the Tomb of Prophet Moses, is splendid
  example of early Islamic architecture set in an awe-inspiring landscape. <br>
  It lies 8 km south west of Jericho on the main Jericho-Jerusalem road. From the main road
  it lies 2 km to the north. It is therefore 28 km to the east of Jerusalem in a semi-desert
  area called Barriyat Al Quds or the Wilderness of Jerusalem, 2 km beyond the sign
  indicating sea level. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">This is a revised version of the text on the maqam prepared by the
  Palestinian Association for Cultural Exchange ( PACE ) in Ramalla, an article by the
  Islamic Research and Heritage Revival Establishment in Jerusalem and from a report made by
  Abass Nimr Published in Al Quds Newspaper in 1997. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><a name="Maqam Hasan Al Ra'i and Maqam Aisha"><font color="#408080"><font size="+1"><b>Maqam Hasan Al Ra'i and Maqam Aisha</b></font></font> <br>
</a>The huge cemetery outside the walls of Nabi Musa is reserved for Muslim pilgrims who
died here during the festivals or those who asked to be buried here because of the
sanctity of the site. According to local tradition, the cemetery includes two important
tombs over which two small maqams have been built: the larger one, about one kilometer
west of Nabi Musa, is held to be that of Hassan Al Ra'i, the shepherd of Prophet Moses,
although records show him to have been the guardian of the maqam in the nineteenth
century. The second tomb, to the southeast, is held to be that of 'Aisha, the favorite
wife of Prophet Mohammed. Again, 'Aisha is known to have died in Syria, this tomb is
perhaps that of a righteous local woman of the same name. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><a name="Tulul Abu Al Alaieq (Herod Palace)"><font size="+1"><font color="#408080"><b>Tulul Abu Al Alaieq (Herod Palace)</b></font></font><br>
</a>The site is made up of several low hills on both sides of wadi Qelt. It is located
right at the southern entrance of Jericho, at the point where wadi Qelt meets the plateau
of Jericho. The site can be reached either from the main Jerusalem-Jericho road, or better
via the old road to Jericho which lines the wadi. The oldest discoveries at Tulul Abu Al
Alaieq date back to the Chalcolithic period 4500-3100BC, but the most impressive remains
are either from the Hellenistic or the Roman periods in date. In Roman times, Jericho was
a garden of fruit and palm trees, it was given as a gift to Cleopatra by Mark Antony. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The city reached its peak under Herod the Great who built his winter
palace at the site of Tulul Abu Al Alaieq. This palace is the best preserved and the most
impressive structure at the site which seems to have served as the administrative center
of the town of Jericho at that time. It was built on both sides of the wadi to allow the
inhabitants to enjoy the scene of the waters of the wadi in winter. A huge garden of palm
trees and Balsam measuring 11000m<font size="-2">2</font> was found during excavation
works on the site to the north of the palace. It was called the Royal Garden. The
foundations of a wall surrounding the complex, several workshops, pools, ovens, a large
wine press, sewage systems and liquid storage buildings, were also found in what is
believed to be the industrial area of the city. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It is not clear when the site was abandoned, this might have
happened after the earthquake which shook the area around the middle of the AD 1st
century. Some remains at Tulul Abu Al Alaieq from the Byzantine and Islamic periods
indicate that the site was never completely abandoned but rather shrunk in size. There are
no entrance fees the the site and visiting is possible all day long. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><a name="Old jericho (Tell Al Sultan)"><font color="#408080"><font size="+1"><b>Old jericho (Tell Al Sultan)</b></font></font><br>
</a>The most ancient city of Jericho is situated on a mound overlooking the oasis, 2km
north west of the center of modern Jericho. Excavations by the late British archaeologist
K. Kenyon uncovered settlements dating from 9000BC. This period marks the transition from
nomadic to settled agricultural life. The site has been cleared to bedrock and more than
23 layers of ancient <br>
civilizations that have built this impressive hill up to the present height have been
uncovered. Many structures are visible here including the oldest known stairs in the
world, the oldest wall, and the massive, round, defense tower dating from before 7000BC at
the center of the site. Those finds make Jericho the first fortified city in history. The
last layer of occupation at the site dates from the late Byzantine - early Islamic
periods. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Jericho's contribution to human civilization is unique. This is
particularly true given the city's role in the domestication of plants and animals and the
invention of pottery. Those developments took place here some 1000 years before
Mesopotamia and Egypt. The walls and tower of Jericho preceded the pyramids of Egypt by
4000 years. Jericho is also famous for its destruction by the invading Israelite tribes
around 1200BC as described in the Old Testament. Excavations, however, <br>
have shown no evidence of this story. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Opposite the tell is the spring of Ain Al Sultan, its waters are
abundant. Its output of 700 cubic meters an hour make it the most important of all springs
of Jericho: Nue'meh, Duyuk, Ojah, and Qelt. Ain Al Sultan was called by this name because
the Babylonians put out the eyes of the ousted king of Jerusalem here. It is also called
Elisha's well, after prophet Elisha who purified its waters by salt. The site is open
daily from 8am to 5pm. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><a name="Mount of Temptation"><font color="#408080"><font size="+1"><b>Mount
of Temptation</b></font></font> <br>
</a>Byzantine-Christian Jericho was situated in and around the modern town. Several
churches and monasteries have been discovered here, the most important of which is the
Monastery of Temptation "Dair Quruntul". The mountain of temptation " Jabel
Quruntul" rises about 350m west of Jericho overlooking the Jordan Valley. Here, Jesus
spent 40 days and nights fasting and meditating during the temptation of Satan. The thirty
to forty caves on the eastern slopes of the mountain were inhabited by monks and hermits
since the early days of Christianity. The path leading to the Greek monastery is very
steep and difficult to climb, but a visit to the monastery certainly is worth the walk.
Other than the monastery one can see the Roman fortress of Al Doq on the top of the
mountain which was built to guard the valley. The word Quruntul derives from the Latin
word. Quadraginta, meaning "forty" to indicate the forty days of the fast of
Christ. The name given to the mountain by the crusaders in the 12th century. The present
monastery was built in the 1895 replacing the earlier crusader Church of the 12th century
date. Visiting hours are from 7am to 3pm and from 4pm to 5pm in summer and from 3pm to 4pm
in winter. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><a name="The Sugar Mills"><font size="+1"><font color="#408080"><b>The
Sugar Mills</b></font></font><br>
</a>Half way between Tell Al Sultan and the Mount of Temptation on your right as you
depart Tell Al Sultan are the sugar mills known as Tawahin Al Sukkar. Sugar cane
production and processing was known in Palestine since the Umayyad period, the Crusaders
expanded sugar production for export to Europe. For that purpose they built sophisticated
sugar mills including those located in Jericho. The remains of the aqueduct which brought
the water from Ain Duyuk are still visible today. The water provided the necessary energy
for the mill and its pottery workshop. One can also see here the remains of the press and
the factory. The site, even though extremely interesting, is not protected and is rarely
visited. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#408080"><a name="Na'aran"><font size="+1"><b>Na'aran</b></font>
</a></font><br>
About four kilometers northwest of Jericho is the Byzantine settlement of Na'aran. The
site is situated next to the spring of Ain Al Duyuk and Ain Al Nue'meh where the aqueduct
that once brought water to Hisham's palace can still be traced. The most impressive
remnant of the aqueduct is the fine arch spanning the wadi close to the springs. Remains
of a synagogue were found in the basement of a private Palestinian house. The beautiful
mosaic floor of AD 5th or 6th century date and the Hebrew inscription reading "peace
upon Israel" make the visit truly interesting. The house is still under Israeli
control even after the hand-over of Jericho to the Palestinian authority, Israeli soldiers
are guarding the site around the clock. </font></p>

<p><a name="HishamPalace(Khirbet al Mafjar)"><font face="Arial" size="+1" color="#408080"><b>Hisham's
Palace (Khirbet al Mafjar)</b></font><font face="Arial" color="#408080"> </font><font face="Arial"><br>
</font></a><font face="Arial">Five (5) km north of Jericho are the ruins of the impressive desert palace of Hisham
(Hisham's Palace). The palace was a country residence built either by the Umayyad Caliph
Hisham Ibn Abd Al Malik (AD 724-743) or Al Walid Ibn Yazid (AD 743-4). The Arab-Umayyad
dynasty ruled an empire stretching from India to France. Like most early Arab rulers,
Hisham preferred the freedom of the desert to the city life of Damascus, the capital. The
palace is a complex of buildings, baths, <br>
mosques, and colonnaded courts. Its mosaics and stucco ornaments are fine examples of
early Islamic art and architecture. Experts say that an earthquake destroyed the buildings
before they were completed. Thus the accumulated sand and debris helped to preserve the
palace's lovely mosaics. The mosaic floors of the baths are a major attraction for
visitors and so is the tree of Life of the guest room (also called the Tree of Human
Cruelty), this is one of the most beautiful mosaics in the world. Many of the carved
stuccos from the palace are displyed at the Rockefeller Archeological Museum in Jerusalem.
Saladin troops attempted to restore the palace in the 12th century, but thereafter and
down to the 1940's of this century, the ruins served as a quarry of cut stones for the
people of Jericho. A small museum on the right of the entrance houses a collection of
pottery found on the site. Visiting hours are from 8am to 5pm. </font></p>

<p><strong><em><font face="Arial">Location:</font></em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">The site is about five kilometres to the north of Jericho. It is
  possible that the site occupied a vast area where the Caliph practiced his hobby of
  hunting. Traces of the fence that used to surround it can be found here and there, proving
  that it stretched about two kilometers in the direction of the Jordan Rive, but its
  north-south boundaries are difficult to locate accurately. As there were no springs then
  near the site, water from Nuwei’meh Spring, three kilometers to the north west was
  brought to it. This necessitated the construction of a number of bridges in two valleys.
  In ancient times running water was employed to run water mills in two locations. Traces of
  these mills can still be seen about a hundred meters west of the Palace. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em><font face="Arial">Touring the Palace: </font></em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">1. You pass through the external wall from the southern gate on the
  sides of which there are two round towers, and enter into the front courtyard whose length
  is three hundred meters and width forty meters. It is surrounded on its four sides by
  arched porticoes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">2. On proceeding northwards we reach a square pool one meter deep
  with its walls thickly plastered as if they were marble. It is painted red and yellow.
  Water used to gush out from a fountain at its center and pass through an outlet on its
  southern side. It was covered by a ceiling decorated in the Persian fashion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">3. We return a little backwards and change our direction eastwards
  to enter the eastern gate, the main entrance to the Palace building surrounded by two
  square towers. On the two sides of the entrance there are two stone seats, each containing
  three round props as if they were cushions on which the watchman stretched himself. On the
  top of the seats there is a zone embellished with drawings of flowers and leaves topped by
  three niches in which statues were erected, covered by half circular arches resembling
  those found on the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. Over the niches stands the ceiling
  covering the entrance, consisting of several Arab arches. This entrance was roofed with
  bricks, which goes to show that labourers from Iraq participated in its construction. It
  was customary for the ceiling to consist of stones available in Syrian mason used in his
  roofs. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">4. This entrance leads to a lobby twelve meters long, on either side
  of which there were nine columns which, together with the walls were covered by gypsum on
  which geometrical figures were inscribed, interspersed with men’s heads covered with
  turbans, and women’s heads covered with veils, leaving no doubt about the Arabic
  nature of this Palace. There are also heads of birds, wild and domesticated animals, some
  of which nibble bunches of grapes and other fruits. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">5. Stepping from the lobby to the courtyard of the Palace we come
  across the moat of the eastern building which consists of eight rooms on the left and an
  equal number on the right. On the western side overlooking the courtyard there is a
  colored picture of flowers and animals as well as a number of window glass panes stocked
  in the corners ready for use. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">6. Moving forward we enter the central courtyard round which rise
  buildings from the four sides. This courtyard is almost a square 29x28 meters, surrounded
  by columns topped by marble arches carrying a ceiling forming a portico in front of the
  rooms which stand behind it. The floor of the courtyard and portico is paved with black
  tiles. Below these tiles are regular outlets from which water flows out of the Palace. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">7. The eastern building consists of four rectangular rooms. In the
  middle stands the Caliph’s private mosque, its walls covered with white marble, but
  whose niche is free from decoration and embellishment. These rooms are not tiled, but
  tiles were found piled up ready for use. The rooms and mosque were mastefully roofed with
  tiles or stones preventing the leakage of water to the inside. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">8. The Caliph’s residence was in the western building,
  consisting of two rows of rooms each having six rooms of various width. They contained
  inner doors joining them together so that their residents did not need to go out to the
  partico and courtyard. In the middle was the Caliph’s bathroom reached by descending
  stairs to a depth of five meters. In the bathroom there was a fire-place, a hot water
  basin and a rest chamber. The seats placed on the sides were paved with colored mosaics.
  Water descended to the bathroom from a reservoir receiving its water from the main canal.
  On the roof this room was the special office of the Caliph roofed with red bricks. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">9. The northern building consists of a large entrance hall 29 meters
  long and eleven meters wide. No partitions divides it into rooms, but there are bridges in
  it. Its roof contains seven small domes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">10. Between this northern entrance hall and the eastern building
  there are steps leading to the upper floor over-looking the palace courtyard. The ceiling
  of the portico stood on white marble columns thinner than the ground floor columns. Some
  of them have crosses indicating that they were taken from the ruins of local churches.
  Between the marble columns there is a gypsum ail inscribed with geometrical and floral
  motifs. They were found cast on the ground floor along with decorative and pictorial
  plaster. They were collected in a special hall in the Archeological Museum in Jerusalem in
  an admirable way. On looking at these gypsum forms you will find that it competes with the
  most advanced level that this arts has reached among the Persians. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">11. The most beautiful part of this portico was the eastern one
  overlooking the small garden in front of the palaces, and the great field surrounding the
  Palace which used to be a charming park with its trees and flowers as if it were a piece
  of the gardens of Damascus. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">12. We descend the stairs which we climbed, and return to the
  portico in front of the northern entrance hall, and proceed westwards, changing our
  direction northwards. We ascend steps leading to a path to the right of which there is an
  open yard which is the yard of the mosque standing to the east of it. It is the mosque in
  which the residents of the Palace pray. We see clearly its niche to the south. We see also
  behind it the remnants of the minaret adjoining the wastern entrance hall. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">13. we now return to the western passage leading to the big hall,
  the reception hall adjoining the bathroom area. It is a square hall. Everyone of its sides
  has three round curves, and in every curve there stands the statue of a bare-breasted
  woman with her necklace, or the statue of a man wearing a lion cloth. This hall is singled
  out by its many colored mosaics making it a masterpiece of splendour and brilliance. The
  most important part is that which was found in the middle section of the wall of the
  western wall where the Caliph used to sit watching the slave-girls dancing in front of him
  in that spectacular hall. This entrance hall was roofed by a big dome in its middle
  surrounded by four domes on a lower level. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">14. when the caliph left the bathroom he resorted to a room on the
  north western corner of the entrance hall. The internal part of this room has a half
  circular chamber, paved with the most spectacular mosaics in the world. The Seville orange
  tree appears in it. Under it and on its two sides can be noticed the emotions of the
  animals a victorious and a vanquished deer. Around this figure there is a view in the
  shape of a Persian carpet. Sixteen kinds of stones were employed in paving it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">15. The real facilities of the bathroom were to be found behind the
  lobby or entrance hall from the north. Hot water is distributed from it through clay
  pipes, facilitating the flow of water over the bathroom basin. In some of them the bather
  enjoyed a steam bath in a way not surpassed by the central heating facilities and the
  luxury and the comforts of life that go with it these days. When the plaster peeled off
  there appeared the red brick which preserved the heat. Most of the bathrooms had side
  seats in which the bather relaxed after the loosening of his muscles. In their roofs there
  were windows allowing a little light to enter to soothe the nerves. The Palace had a big
  garden with abundant trees and flowers. The remains of the Mosque and its niche can still
  be seen. the Mosque lies between the Palace and the bathrooms. Apparently Byzantine
  artists were brought to work on these drawings with mosaics, considered among the most
  beautiful masterpieces that have ever reached us. Archeologists who excavated the Palace
  believe that the earthquake which occurred in 746 A.D. destroyed the whole Palace before
  the upper floor had been completed. The Palace was destroyed at the same time as the
  Church of the Holly Sepulcher in Jerusalem, Jarash churches and others were destroyed. The
  Palace site continued to be abandoned until construction in Jericho was renewed and people
  began to take its carved stones to build their homes with. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Work on the construction of the Palace and equipping it continued
  until the death of Hisham 125 A.H. ( 743 A.D. ). There is no evidence to prove that he
  spent a single winter in it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Three years later the Umayyad state collapsed. The ‘Abbasids
  showed no interest in its buildings, so that they transferred the seat of the Caliphate to
  Iraq. It is not improbable that the coins and few pieces of pottery found of this age
  belonged to the labourers who worked there. It appears from their names such as Qustantin,
  Simon, Yuhanna ( Jhon) and Morcos (Mark) that others were Christians - working together. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">It appears that a company from Saladin the Ayubite’s army
  repaired some rooms of this Palace and inhabited them in the twelfth century A.D., leaving
  some remains such as coins and pottery. The Palace remained in ruins until 1933, when
  digging work started, then the Jordanian Antiquities Department drew the five years an
  1957-1961 to uncover whatever parts of the Palace remained. Digging in the two seasons of
  1957-1958 resulted in discovering the homes of the workers who had built the Palace...and
  miners’ shops. All these findings go back in time to the interval between the eighth
  and twelfth century A.D. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The Palace reveals to us the progress of social life among the
  Muslims. It is supplied with a remarkable network of canals joined to magnificent
  bathrooms. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">A lot of carved gypsum which was in those buildings was transferred
  to the Palestine Archeological Museum in Jerusalem where it is now exhibited. What made
  this necessary is that the gypsum is very brittle, and cannot be left in its place,
  exposed to changes in the weather, particularly as most of it is painted and colored. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">This is what is contained in Arabic sources about the Palace. The
  efforts of man and his strife were, in fact, enjoyable and entertaining. Mr. Baramki who
  participated in the archeological work of the Palace is an Arab from Jerusalem. The Palace
  is considered one of the greatest tourist centers of the Umayyad period in the west bank.
  For example to prove how important it is, the Palace of Hisham in 1961 had 19154 visitors,
  in 1962 23302 visitors, in 1964, 19376 visitors and in 1965, 25429 visitors. </font></p>

</font><br>
</a>Twenty (20) km south of Jericho, one kilometer before Ain Al Faskha on the western
shore of the Dead Sea, is one of the world's most ancient monasteries "monastery of
the Essenes". This is the place where the world famous Dead Sea Scrolls were found.
The discovery story of the scrolls goes back to 1947 when a Bedouin shepherd happened upon
several scrolls in clay jars hidden in a cave on a rocky cliff high above the Dead Sea.
The Jordan Department of Antiquities along with the French school of archaeology in
Jerusalem, searched every hole in these desolate hills and turned up one of the most
exciting discoveries of modern times: Biblical manuscripts, 2000 years old, predating by
some 1000 years the earliest known Hebrew text of the Old Testament. Among the finds were
books of an unknown religious community, identified as the Essenes, a pre-Christian,
mystical Jewish sect. The writings in these scrolls covered a period of 300 years,
including the birth of Christ. They offer insights and a background to the teachings of
Christ. The Essence community came to Qumran in the late second century BC. They lived in
caves and dwellings around Khirbet Qumran under strict rules of obedience and high ethical
standards in a <br>
secluded life of prayer and study. They spent their lives studying and writing the holy
scripture and praying for the coming of the Messiah. To cope with the problem of water on
the waterless hilltop, an aqueduct was built to bring captured rainwater from nearby Wadi
Qumran. Visitors will notice a large numbers of cisterns at the site. In AD 68 the
settlement came to an abrupt end when a Roman Legion, enroute to Jerusalem to put down a
revolt, destroyed the community. The Essence fled after placing their precious manuscripts
in the nearby caves for safekeeping, but they never came back, the settlement and the
people were lost to history. Displays of scroll fragments may be seen at the Archeological
Museums in Amman and in the museums of Jerusalem. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><a name="Dead Sea(Bahr Lut )"><font color="#408080"><font size="+1"><b>Dead
Sea (Bahr Lut )</b></font></font> <br>
</a>A small lake whose dropping of water-level caused its length to decrease from 76km
early this century to less than 50km today. Its width varies from 15 to less than 3km.
Situated at about 405m below Sea level, it is the lowest place on earth. The Dead Sea is
unique in the world: no life exists here because of its high salt content which is about
25% more than the average sea. The climate in the area is extremely hot in summer and the
rate of evaporation is quite rapid. This, coupled with <br>
the fact that the amount of water coming in from the Jordan has lessened because much of
it is being channeled into irrigation channels run of the river higher up. This has led to
fears that the sea could evaporate. Plans to bring water to the Dead Sea via a canal from
the Mediterranean or the Red sea are thus under consideration. The waters of the Dead Sea
are helpful in treating skin diseases. Several bathing beaches along the sea shores such
as Galia, Ain Fashkha, Ain Gedi, an Ain Boqeq provide showers and changing room for
visitors. Ain Gedi, 55km south of Jericho is probably the most visited beach. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><a name="The River Jordan"><font color="#408080"><font size="+2"><b>The
River Jordan</b></font></font> <br>
</a>Eight (8) km east of Jericho, is the river Jordan. Sadly, the western bank of the
river with its many religious and historical sites are not accessible to tourists because
it is a closed Israeli military zone. The Jordan is the longest river in Palestine (252km)
but it can be a visual disappointment as it is neither wide nor deep. The Jordan is rather
a shallow stream flowing from north to south and on into the Dead sea. Its significance
lies in its historical and biblical associations. Much of the river runs parallel with the
boundary between Jordan to the east and the West Bank and Israel to the west. It is part
of the great rift valley which runs from Syria to Tanzania. Just before the point where
the Jordan flows into the Dead Sea, a number of bridges are found, the most important of
which is the British built Allenby bridge, also known as Jesr Al-Karameh by the
Palestinians and King Husein bridge by the Jordanians. It is the main crossing point
between the West Bank and Jordan. King Abdullah Bridge lies to the south of the Allenby
bridge, and between these two bridges lies the site of Jesus' baptism. The site is
seasonally used by the Orthodox church and Roman Catholic church; unfortunately, however,
it is out of reach to tourists as it is a military zone and it is unsure when or whether
this will change. <br>
