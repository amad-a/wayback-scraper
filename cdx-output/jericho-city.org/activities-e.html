          have set up tents on the Jericho Stadium for the Child Municipal 
          Council camping activities. The 32 members of the council were engaged 
          in a training course during the camping activities that lasted for two 
          successive days and will be held at the end of each week. The training 
          course consists of 30 training hours tackling subjects such as 
          citizenship, children’s rights, human rights, communication, 
          leadership skills, identifying the needs and priorities, and 
          organizing and evaluation. This activity is carried out within the 
          efforts exerted by the Municipality for supporting and backing up the 
          elected child council and implanting the democratic values within 
          children and assuring their participation in taking the responsibility 
          since early stages of childhood. These ideas and hopes were declared 
          in the workshop titled Jericho is a child friendly city that was 
          organized by the Municipality in the beginning of February.where the 
          Mayor of Jericho Mr. Abdel-Karim Sider launched some projects oriented 
          towards children’s in the presence of the special representative of 
          UNICEF Pierre Poupard , these projects included some recommendations 
          in the field of childcare some of which are forming committees 
          emerging from the child municipal council for monitoring the extent of 
          implementing the special principles related to the child friendly city 
          agreement in the city of Jericho.</font></p>

          them capable of taking up responsibility for the community, aware of 
          their rights as effective and equal citizens in the community. On the 
          other hand, children expressed their strong interest in this activity, 
          where they acquired some of the necessary life experiences. Such as 
          the ability to chair and facilitates meeting efficiently, the ability 
          to set plans and implement them and evaluate them, and the ability to 
          identify the needs and priorities and evaluate activities and 
          accomplishments. The children also expressed their understanding of 
          the Municipality continuos efforts to support them and develop their

          places such as dome of the rock and the resurrection church and the 
          Burak wall. Finally, he worked as a tour guide in the city. </font>
