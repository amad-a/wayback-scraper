style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;">This bylaw shall operate starting the day it becomes approved by the child municipal council and shall not be amended without the agreement of the child municipal council.<br></span><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;"><br></span><font color="#008080"><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;">Annex illustrating the child municipal council Bylaw<br></span></font><font color="#008080"><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;"><br></span></font><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;">As a result of the need for an amendment for the child municipal council bylaw in its 1999 term (it only included 6th grade, also the inability for the municipality to conduct elections in the year 2000 and 2001 due to Israeli reoccupation of the Palestinian territories).<br></span><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;">The Jericho municipality in coordination with the UNICEF has amended the child municipal council bylaw taking into consideration the remarks that were sent to the Jericho municipality from other involved institutions. These remarks encompassed the necessity to involve students of less academic attainments.<br></span><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;">In addition to that, there was an obvious necessity for the member to participate for more than one year. As a result, the Jericho municipality and the UNICEF have convened several meetings to discuss these suggested amendments. Finally, the bylaw was approved in its current form.<br></span><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;">2- In order to pass the experience from the former members in the council to the new ones, the Jericho municipality found it essential to keep the old members in the council elected in the preceding term in 1999. These will become members in the new council without being elected which will consequently make them members in the general assembly. On the other hand, elections will be carried out to elect members from grades 7 and 8 for the consultative and administrative board. (Students in the 9th grade have been elected in the year 1999) and their duration will be for this year only.<br></span><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;">3- in the coming years and in the beginning of each academic year, internal elections will be organized to elect students from the 7th grade only, where the old 7th grade students will replace the 8th grade in the council, and the 8th grade students will replace the 9th grade. These replaced 9th grade students will have their membership terminated.<br></span><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;">4- after electing new members in the consultative assembly in the beginning of each year,( this will only include the students in the 7th grade), the students in the 7th grade in all schools and in general elections will elect one student from each school to represent them in the administrative board in the child council. These elected students will replace the students of the old 9th grade who will be terminated from the council's administrative board.<br></span><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;">5- The members of the administrative board for this year will consist of:<br></span><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;">a- members of the administrative board for the child municipal council elected in 1999 (students of the 9th grade).<br></span><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;">b- One representative on behalf of each class (7th and 8th grades) from the participating schools in the administrative board.<br></span><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;">c- in addition to 50% of the number of the represented students in section (b) in this paragraph where the elections shall include the sections (a and b) in this paragraph, for example if the number of the 7th and 8th grade students in all the participating schools was 9 classes there should be an additional 9 members representing all classes which will be submitted to general elections, In addition to 50% of the number 9, which is the number of students representing the classes.( in case of an odd number it will be approximated to the higher even number) for ex. 9+5 = 14 student from the consultative assembly will be elected to be appointed in the administrative board. When counting the votes, 50% will be offered to those with the highest results, and after that one representative for each class will be elected according to the highest votes he or she obtains.<br></span><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;">6- Persistently and in the coming years the number of the administrative board members in the council will consist of:<br></span><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;">a- The members that were elected previously in grades 7 and 8.<br></span><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;">b- The members that will be elected at the beginning of each academic year. In the consultative assembly, in general elections organized for all the 7th grade students in all schools on the condition that there will be one representative for each school ( only for 7th grade) in addition to 50%, for ex. If the number of the 7th grade classes in Jericho schools was 10 the general elections will run to elect 10+5= 15 students to be members in the administrative board. This will continue for the next coming years.<br></span><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;"><br></span><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;">7- concerning the internal elections in schools and in case there was more than one section for each class the elections will run so as to include all the sections altogether where all the students will participate as a whole and shall have the right of electing and nomination.<br></span><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;"><br></span><span style="font-size:16;line-height:19px;">8- The number of sections for each class has no relation to the number of representatives in the internal elections for the consultative assembly or in the general elections for the administrative board (the same number of representatives for everybody).</span></p></td>
