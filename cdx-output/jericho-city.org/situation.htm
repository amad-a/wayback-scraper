<p><font color="Blue" size="4"><u><b>A Statement by the Municipality of Jericho</b></u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">We call upon all our friends and all others who have conscience all over the world to save our souls which seek peace and to listen to our appeal under siege.  We call upon you to stand by us in such difficult times; a whole nation is being subjected to the cruelest ways of torture everyday.</font><br>
<font size="3">Crimes are being committed against our nation; cities are being isolated, and curfews are being imposed without any exceptions for anyone not even children or patients.  Our nation is suffering from lack of food, water and medicine; electricity as well as any other way to get in touch with the outside world are being denied.  All human rights and peace treaties are being ignored and furthermore, genocide is being committed in every city; and who is the criminal?  It is the same one responsible for massacring our people in Sabra and Shatila refugee camps back in 1982.</font><br>
<font size="3">Jenin Refugee Camp, the old city in Nablus, and the Nativity Church in Bethlehem in which unarmed and determined Palestinians to resist oppression and occupation are surrounded by Israeli troops well equipped with American made artillery.  We fear a second Sabra and Shatila massacre with hundreds and hundreds of victims; we call upon you to join us in our call for help so that we can prevent the massacre from taking place.  </font><br>
<font size="3">The cities of Ramallah, Jenin, and Nablus and other Palestinian cities were reoccupied and randomly bombed; infra- structures were destroyed, collective arrest measures were taken, and worship and holy places were attacked.  All these measures are justified by fighting terrorism and seeking peace by the Israeli government; however, such actions create hostility and hate among nations and never lead to peace.</font><br>
<font size="3">What's going on in Palestine deserves to take action by you to stop this vicious attack against our nation. Therefore, we appeal to you to stand by us and to pressure your governments to prevent Sharon and his government from annihilating our nation.</font><br>
<font size="3">We invite you to unite your voices with ours and to join us in our appeal in order to make those voices heard to the American decision- makers who listen to one only voice which is the voice of Israel.</font><br>
<font size="3">We count on you since we trust the ability of people to change realities and to make the sufferings of Palestinians and their struggle for freedom known to the world. </font></p>
