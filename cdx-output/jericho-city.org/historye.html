<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The origin of the name, "Jericho" is Semitic. The common

people pronounce it "Riha". To the Cananaites it meant "the moon". The

word is derived from the verb "yerihu", and "Yarah". Al-Yarah in the

language of southern Arabia means "a month" and "moon". In Hebrew

"yarihu" is the most ancient known city in the Jewish Bible. "Riha" in

Syriac means "scent and odour."</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The Arabs knew the city of Jericho referred to in the Bible by the

name "Raiha" and "Ariha".Yaqut, the writer of "Mu'jam

al-Buldan," mentions that it is the city of Al-Jabbarin (the Mighty) in the Ghaur,

and that it was called Ariha Ibn Malik Ibn Arfakhshad Ibn Sam Ibn Noah, may peace be upon

him. He mentions another name for it, Ariha' mentioned in the poetry of Jarir: <br>

I shall have to increase that suspicion which has beset the slave of Banu Numair. <br>

The devils of the land fear my roar, and the serpent of Aryaha' has responded to me.<br>

Yaqut also refers to it in the form "Ariha'. in the measure "af'al". He

quotes Al-Hutahle's saying: I searched for it (my sword) among the swords of Jericho, and

when it returned to my hand I found no parallel to it.<br>

Al-Bakri says. "It is 'Ariha', or perhaps 'Ariha', when attributing (a noun ) to it

they just say 'Aryahiyy', It was called, "Anthony's present to Cleopatra, when Egypt

fell under the rule of Anthony, Cleopatra, the beautiful Queen of Egypt met him. He was so

bewitched by her beauty that he deserted his wife, sister of Octavious ( Augustus ).

Cleopatra deprived her lover of his will-power for nine whole months. He became infatuated

with her and offered her a large section of Syria. The Palestinian shores, together with

Jericho and its groves abundant with balm, as well as the Dead Sea, were among what he

offered Cleopatra.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The city of Jericho was called "Wadi As-Saisaban, Valley of

Sesban". It was given this name because of the abundance of a certain plant that

grows there. It densely entwines round its groves like a fence, and is still found there.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">It was also called, " Tall As-Sultan " ( the Hill of the

Sultan ) or " Ain Alisha' " ( The Spring of Alisha' ), as ancient Jericho was

merely a small artificial hill called " Tall as-Sultan ", which is the precursor

( origin ) of the first city. It was also called " Madinat an-Nakhil " (The City

of Palms) because palm trees grow in its soil and are abundantly found in it. It was also

called " Ruwaiha " ( the diminution of Raiha' ) which is eight miles away to the

south east of present Jericho. Rousseau has defined Ariha and Riha as each one is

applicable, to the city and region together.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" color="#408080"><strong><a name="Second: Jericho in History until the time of the Arabs">Second: Jericho in History

until the time of the Arabs</a></strong></font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Jericho is one of the most ancient human habitations. The most

ancient human remains were found in it, some of which go back to 5000 years B.C. Others

believe that these remains go back to 7000 years B.C. The most recent opinion on this

subject is that they date back to 8000 years B.C.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The site of ancient Jericho is half a kilometre away from modern

Jericho at a depth of 820 feet ( 250 metres) below sea level. It lies at latitude 31 52

degrees north and longitude 35 39 degrees east. </font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The evidence indicating that it is one of the most ancient cities in

the world is borne up by a series of excavations made at " Tall as-Sultan ",

which is oval in shape, formed by the successive accumulation of ruins with the passing of

time. Excavations have been continuing successively since the middle of the nineteenth

century up till now.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The German-Austrian Mission in which the two archeologists E. Sellin

and C. Watzinger worked, was the first one to be interested in uncovering the antiguities

of Jericho, and that was in 1911. They were succeeded by the English, who conducted

excavations at Tall as-Sultan under the supervision of first J. Garstang ( 1930-1936 ) and

completed by Miss K. Kenyon ( 1952-1961 ). She published a resume of her work in two huge

volumes ( 1960-1965 ). She is considered to be the greatest authority on this subject. She

is the one to have estimated the age of the city to be 8000 years B.C. Its habitation

certainly started about that time which undoubtedly makes it the most ancient known city

in the world.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">That is why it is probable that the most ancient civilization in the

world did not appear in the Nile Valley or the Tigris and Euphrates Valley, but in the

Jordan Valley. Dr. Kenyon gave the name of " Ariha al-Ula " ( The first Jericho

) to the first construction of the city which was sacked and destroyed as a result of

invasions, earthquakes and fire time and again. Every time it was destroyed it rose once

again on the ruins of the past Jericho. Kenyon and the archeologists who preceded her were

able to distinguish between the successive periods Jericho passed through.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Jericho in the Neolithic Times or the Late Stone Age Periods: <br>

These ages are divided into three parts:</font></p>

<blockquote dir="ltr">

  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Miss Kenyon's excavations have revealed that the ancient city was

  inhabited during four successive intervals during this age. The first was the first

  Neolithic Time. In this it was inhabited by a folk called " An-Natifiyyun ", who

  depended for their food on collecting wild seeds. It is probable that they did not plant

  seeds in reality, but owned scythes with flint edges, straight bone handles to harvest

  wild seeds, and stone mortars with handles for grinding them. Some of these groups lived

  in caves, while other groups occupied primitive villages excelling in the art of

  architecture. So they started to build round huts from sun-dried bricks flat at the bottom

  curving at the higher edge. They used to bury their dead with their personal jewellery in

  graves hewn out of rock. </font></p>

  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">These folks dug out canals using the waters of " Ain as-Sultan

  to irrigate their lands. They constructed huge walls two metres wide round their villages.

  They erected in them a circular huge tower, nine metres ( thirty feet ) in diametre, and

  ten metres high. In its midst there are stairs leading from the bottom of the town to its

  top. They were exposed to the attacks of groups from outside. These folks practised

  agriculture, the domestication of animals, and weaving the making chains and mats, as well

  as animal hunting. They used spears and flint-capped arrows. They also used hatchets to

  cut tree branches. These groups had started to expand from their settlements in search of

  new homes outside their boundaries.</font></p>

<blockquote dir="ltr">

  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The building of houses in this interval showed a great progress.

  Their rooms were about 6.5 metres by 5 metres or 3 by 7 metres. They were usually of a

  rectangular shape built in an open yard, seven metres long and seven metres wide and used

  for cooking. The thickness of their wall was half a metre. They used stones to build the

  foundation, and the rest of the building was built of sun-dried bricks. Its shape was

  similar to the iron used for cauterising animals. So the brick was rectangular in shape

  with sharpened edges. The floor formed was of a mud layer topped by a layer of lime,

  followed by soft lime dyed red or light blue. Then it was polished to acquire a new

  lustre.</font></p>

  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Its houses were of one or two stories. The ceiling was built of

  reeds and mud. Their flint intensils were sharp-edged. Small statues were made of unbaked

  mud. In the past these statues possessed a religious significance. Female statues might

  indicate the fertility goddess. It seems that these folks practiced the worship of

  ancestors as nine skulls were found whose facial features were painted with lime with two

  mother-of-pearl eyes placed on their faces.</font></p>

<blockquote dir="ltr">

  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">This Age preceded by many centuries the discovery of pottery. The

  people who lived in this period were raiders coming from outside. They settled at Tall,

  and might have been nomadic Bedouins. Their looms have been found but their homes have

  disappeared. Jasper beads and pierced mother-of-pearl were found to be possessed by them.

  They buried their dead collectively in special vaults inside the city. They kept skulls in

  particular in the mausoleum of prominent men of their age. The lifespan of many of them is

  estimated, in the light of their remains to be 35 years. Few of them reached the age of

  50. This Age is divided into two periods:</font></p>

  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The first Neolithic Pottery Age:<br>

  people in this age lived in pits. They worked in agriculture and in domesticating animals.

  They introduced the manufacture of pottery to their homes, but it was a primitive and

  rough one painted in red in geometrical figures.</font></p>

  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The Second Neolithic Pottery Age:<br>

  People in this age were a great deal more advanced than their predecessors, as they lived

  in huts built of clay and manufactured earthenware in inclined lines.</font></p>

</blockquote>



<p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Jericho in the Post Neolithic Age:</font></p>



<p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" color="#408080"><strong><a name="The Bronze Age:">The Bronze Age:</a></strong></font></p>



<p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">At the end of the Neolithic Age which was about the year 4000 B.C.,

a vacancy occurred in man's residence in Jericho and it became uninhabited for a certain

period of time. There are two different evidences to support this: the existence of an

accumulated layer of disintegrated organic matter over the Hill, part of which is

recognizable, and the absence of any remains from the age known as the Chalcolithic Age

which followed the Neolithic Age, and in which metals were used for the first time.</font></p>



<p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The date of man's habitation on the Tall ( Hill ) can be traced back

to about 3200 B.C. The best illustration of this can be found in tombs. The main

cemeteries of old Jericho are found on the site on which the 'Aqapat Jabr refugee camp

stands from the northern part. Some graves were dug up in the streets and courtyards of

the camp. The most interesting of these graves is one which goes back to that age, as it

was found as a result of an examination by carbon number 14, that its history goes back to

3260 B.C. ± 110 years. That grave contained 113 skulls arranged round the tomb's chamber.

The center of the chamber contained a heap of burnt bones. Some of the skulls carried the

traces of scorching a heap of burnt bones. Some of the skulls carried the traces of

scorching but were not deliberately burnt. This indicates the existence of certain strange

customs in connection with burial rites. we also conclude that the bodies of the dead were

first placed in the open until the flesh was decomposed and separated from the bones. The

collecting of these numerous bone skeletons followed, with the skulls being symmetrically

arranged in a row round the tomb's chamber with their faces directed towards the inside.

The bones were heaped in the middle with the necessary inflammable material. Then it was

set on fire. When the heap cooled down after burning, the funeral offerings made mostly of

earthenware, were placed in the grave, while the burnt bones were covered by a layer of

stone chips. In reality, the other archeological discoveries in Palestine and Trans-Jordan

did not produce any evidence corroborating the existence on these customs, though the

custom of exposing bodies in the open, until the flesh disintegrated was not a custom

remote from what was familiar. We have nothing about those people except that they were

the pioneers of the following age, that is the First Bronze Age, which was the most

prosperous one in Jordan and Palestine. We see the features of the First Bronze Age, which

extends from 2900 B.C, evidently clear in Jericho especially with regard to defensive

fortifications in the town. These fortifications were, no doubt, supremely important. </font></p>



<p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The defensive walls were repaired and rebuilt sixteen times during

the First Bronze Age which lasted 600 years. It is often difficult to indicate the various

periods when the renewal of the building of the walls was made, as they used to fall down

as a result of earthquakes, or because of infiltration of water into their foundations,

and the people were prompt to repair them. Some destruction befell the walls as a result

of enemy attacks. In any case there appear on these walls during that period the traces of

destruction and ruin, but traces of repairs and renewed building are also apparent on

then. This goes to show that the inhabitants of the town lived a life devoid of security

and stability. </font></p>



<p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Nevertheless, the general picture shows a continuous improvement in

the fields of civilization and construction as people started to use copper in large

quantities in order to manufacture weapons and tools. Pottery utensils show an abundance

of trade exchange with all neighbouring valleys.</font></p>



<p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">This period revealed a great progress in civilization, as it was

accompanied by the appearance of new towns in numerous sites that had been hitherto

uninhabited. But this civilization, along with other civilizations preceding it, crumbled

and came to an end at the hands of Bedouin raiders. It seems that the people at the end of

First Bronze Age started to enjoy a greater stability and tranquility leading to the

neglect of these defensive fortifications.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">But then came a time in which they woke up from their heedlessness

because the latest wall, dating back to that period reveals quick ill-contructed repairs

on the remains of a wall previously constructed. The foundation stones appear as if they

had been hurriedly dropped and with no organization. Then the wall started to be built of

baked brick moulds over the stones. Baked brick moulds used in other walls appear on this

wall. But calamity overtook those folks before they completed the construction of that

wall which was itself destroyed by fire, and the town fell into the hands of raiding

Bedouin tribes.</font></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">After this date new inhabitants settled in Jericho. They resided

first on the top of the Hill. They built for themselves some ramshackle homes. The spread

of these homes stretched on the Hill slopes, as there was no defensive wall in that

interval. There is an edifice on the western side which may have been originally a temple,

as what resembles an altar was discovered together with the remains of a small animal

under its foundations. This period is known as marking the beginning of the Middle Bronze

Age. </font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">In reality the tombs of those people attracted most attention,

contrary to the collective cemeteries where the dead used to be buried in previous ages.

They buried one dead person in every grave only placing with him some chattels and

jewellery. Graves stretching 248 metres from the original three hundred and sixty metres

were discovered at Tall A-Sultan. Some of these graves were very wide with the pit's width

being three metres and its depth five metres. The dimensions of the mausoleum chamber were

360, 330 and a height of 260 cms, which necessitated digging out 150 tons of rocks, and

all this was for the sake of burying one person. We can see that bodies were exposed until

the bones were stripped off before they were buried, as the folks who came before them

did. The objects placed inside the grave varied in accordance with the models of graves.

In some of them there was nothing save a dagger, in others pins and beads ( presumably

these belonged to women ). In some others some pottery utensils only were found, while in

other tombs a number of jars, a dagger or a spear head. Nevertheless all these had one

thing common namely the existence of a small niche hewn out of the wall of the mausoleum

chamber. It contained a four-headed lamp, the type which was prevalent in that period. It

appears that on the smooth surface of a rock of the corners of a grave that someone had

drawn some small pictures in the form of a goat or an ibex or a tree, in addition to two

men armed with spears and shields. This is, as we know, the only known illustration from

these people. Then earthenware utensils are not distinguished for accuracy and mastery,

having no adornment except for some circular lines which are colourless, and no paint of

any sort, a proof that they were only made then for utilitarian use without any interest

to decorate them. </font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">It is probable that these new inhabitants were no other than the

Amorites who occupied most of the Middle Eastern countries, including Iraq and Egypt,

during the period between 2300-1900 B.C. But they themselves were the victims of a greater

invasion by the Hyksos.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" color="#408080"><strong><a name="The Hyksos:">The Hyksos:</a></strong></font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Jericho was one of the strong-holds of the Hyksos or Shepherd Kings

1750-1580 B.C. as the Bible calls them. It is believed that they brought horses with them,

and perhaps the chariot, to Palestine and Egypt.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Their houses were well built and covered the whole top of the Hill.

Before their arrival the town was surrounded by a strong baked bricks, wall. They

introduced a brand new system of defensive fortifications, not to Jericho alone, but also

to all parts of Palestine. This new defensive system consisted of a steep earth slope

topped by a wall made of moulded baked bricks.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The tombs of this period are generally characterized by being the

tombs of ancient people reused. One can see the grave chamber covered by a big stone, and

the opening filled with earth. It seems that the reason for the preservation of things in

good condition is accounted for by the infiltration of gases from cracks in the rock. They

were accumulated in the chamber eradicating moth and disintegration germs. Wooden tables,

baskets, seats, stuffing and artificial hairs, and even pieces of votive offerings' flesh

were found, all remaining in a good condition. All tombs were in the shape of collective

mausoleums. They used to accumulate the bone skeletons and first offerings in the corners

to leave room for the new dead. In the Palestine Archeological Museum in Jerusalem there

is one of these tombs, constructed in accordance with the condition in which it was in the

ancient times. Jericho was the third city in importance as its geographical situation had

the advantage of controlling the direct route with the lands rich in cereals in Trans

jordan. </font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><strong><font face="Arial" color="#408080"><a name="The Canaanites:">The Canaanites:</a></font></strong></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">These were among the folks that emigrated from Arabia to physical

Syria, and Jericho was one of their most important cities ( 1400 B.C. ). The name "

Jericho " to them meant " the moon ". Their houses were built near the site

of Al-'Ain where the fortress gate stood. The area of the city was six acres in their

time, and its walls reached a height of twenty one feet. </font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Their type of architecture followed this model : every building

consisted of one room having side doors and elevated platforms and was surrounded by

asphalted black soil. Their walls were built on the Babylonian style. The grandeur of

their buildings was evident from their monuments which included stone columns on both

banks of the Jordan River, from the inside of the Temple of Jericho, and from the

buildings erected round a courtyard in the middle of which there was a wide arched gate

which led into it. This Canaanite style still prevails in the Palestinian rural areas as

well as cities, and in the circular type of the architecture of the dome which appears in

the villages of 'Ain Malaha,' Ainat, Jericho and Wadi An-Nutuf. It is one of the most

prominent characteristics of Canaanite architecture. </font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The Canaanites excelled in the sculpture of statues and in pictorial

sculpture which appears in the layers of gypsum covering the skulls, and which are similar

to a head cover. It is exactly similar to the contemporary head dress worn by Palestinian

women. It is known by its popular name, "Al-Wiqahyah" ( The protector ), or

" As-Samada" or " Al- 'Usabh al-kan'aniyyah "( The Canaanite Turban ).

Weaving looms, clothes, bedding, mats, tables, chairs, mineral pins for binding clothes

and for adornment were found.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Earthware manufacture was advanced with them. We find plates, jugs,

large copper basins, large water-jars pots and clay ovens (bread ovens that resemble those

of present villages ). Excavations disclosed numerous family mausoleums containing remains

of bodies next to which were found the traces of food, cooked or grilled mutton in

earthenware utensils, and the remains of cereals, pomegranates and raisins. </font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">It is clear that the religious belief has become now more evident

and more refined than before as threefold statues were found in Jericho, which remind us

of the trinity in Canaanite worship, namely the Fertility God, the Fertility Goddess, and

the Enemy of the Fertility God. The statue of the Fertility Goddess was the statue of

Goddess ' Anat known in the texts of Agarith where she seizes her breasts in order to give

fertility and life to the land of the Canaanites. As far as the religious places are

concerned there is a temple in Jericho containing a niche. The plan of its architecture

was taken by the Jews in their synagogues. Then the Christians transferred it to their

churches, later it appeared in Islamic mosques. </font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Jericho did not reach this level of civilization alone, many cities

participated in it as ( Hazor-Na'anek and Megiddo ) on the northeast trade route, Shkeim,

Beirut and Jerusalem and others from the categories of Canaanite cities were like Jericho,

in progress, architecture, and power. The Bible described that when the Israelites said

about the Canaanites that they were " a people stronger than they and of greater

stature with great cities pointing to heaven. You said to them : Do not fear them. God,

your lord who leads you fights for you." </font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Excavations at Salin revealed the remains of two Canaanite

fortresses, one of which rose on one of the seven hills on which Jericho was built. <br>

The fortress consisted of three stories reached by stairs to the towers which protected

it. Excavations revealed, too, the remnants of Canaanite walls built of baked bricks over

stone buttresses not fewer than three metres in width. Behind the wall there were

furnished houses containing oil jars and earthenware inscribed with drawings of lions and

gazelles. It was surrounded by fertile oases containing palm trees. That is why it is

called " the city of palm trees " in Deuteronomy and in Judges and in the books

of the Old Testament a lot is said about its prosperity brisk trade, numerous store shops,

warehouses, animals for transport and consumption, vessels and utensils made of copper,

iron, silver and gold.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" color="#408080"><strong><a name="The Israelite Invasion:">The

Israelite Invasion:</a></strong></font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">At the beginning of the thirteenth century B.C. the Israelites

invaded Palestine after their exodus from Egypt and several years in Sinai and in the

region of the northern Arabian Peninsula. They started by attacking Trans jordan where

they crossed the Jordan River Valley on foot coming from the hills of Moab on the ( East

Bank ). They pitched a camp at Abel Shetem whence they moved on Palestine under the

command of Joshua. Jericho was among the Palestinian cities which fell into their hands

after making for them from their camps which they had erected from clay and palm branches,

forty years after their exodus from Egypt. Priests bore the Arc of the Covenant and

compassed the city with it, headed by the seven priests, the trumpet-bearers, walking and

blowing the trumpets with those who were armed walking behind the Arc of the Covenant and

blowing their trumpets, and so they did once daily for six days. On the seventh day the

priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, " Shout, for the lord hath

given you the city. And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to

the lord: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house,

because she hid the messengers that we sent Yoshah son of Nun Moses' boy and Calob son of

Yofnah - and it is said Kilab son of Yofnah, Moses' nephew. </font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">In the Bible there is a horrible picture of the treatment by

Israelites of its inhabitants. we read in the Bible: "... so that the people went up

into the city" (that is Jericho) "And they utterly destroyed all that was in the

city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the

sword, "and they bunt the city with all that was in it, "But all the silver, and

gold, and vessels of brass and iron are consecrated unto the Lord: they shall come into

the treasury of the Lord,"</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Thus Jericho remained in this condition until it was repaired in the

reign of Ahab the son of Ouri who was one of the kings of Israel (874-852 B.C.) Hiel the

Bethelite fortified and repaired it four hundred years after its destruction There is a

reference to that in the Bible, namely that Joshna 's curse befell Hiel.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" color="#408080"><strong><a name="Jericho after the Israelites:">Jericho

after the Israelites:</a></strong></font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">It appears that Jericho flourished in Ruman times as is shown in the

remains of canals they dug and which can be seen at the River Kilt. In this period Jericho

started to export dates. Jericho acquired a great importance in the time of Christ (may

peace be upon him) as Jesus Christ Himself visited it and cured the eyes of two blind men,

Bartimoeus and his friend. While He was in it He visited Zacchaeus the publican in his

house. As Zacchaeus was of small statue he was forced to climb up a tree to see Jesus in

the crowd. Jesus walked along the caravan rout between Jericho and Jerusalem, which was

infested with thieves and highwaymen.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">In the reign of constantine the Great (306-337 A.D.), the founder of

constantinople, Christianity was spread in Jericho by monks and hermits who lived in

convents and churches which they constructed to become a centre for the propagation of

Christianity. In 325 A.D. it became the centre of a bishopric. </font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">The Roman Emperor Justinian (527-665 A.D.) constructed a church in

it. It was in his reign that a road was built joining it with Petra. The caravans used to

cross it in 3-4 days. Another road was built joining it with Bisan.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">It appears that churches and convents became more numerous than they

were in the seventh century. Arco Levaux said that three was a church at Al-Juljal, and

another at the place where it is thought that Jesus took off His garment before His

baptism. Another church was built inside a large convent under the name of St. John. It

lies on a height overlooking the Jordan River.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Nevertheless this did not prevent the deterioration, neglect and

ruin that began to befall Jericho and the churches and convents round it, following the

diversion of the caravan route. The hermits' caves on the Mount of Temptation overlooking

the city, remained an indication of the lofty spirit of the early and medieval centuries.</font></p>



<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Finally Jericho entered into the rule of the Arab who occupied these

countries in the seventh century A.D. In the dawn of Islam Jericho became the main city in

the Ghaur inhabited by a folk from Qais, as well as a group from Quraish. During the time

of the Prophet, may peace and prayer be upon him, he drove the Jews out of Madinah because

of their tyranny, and they left for Syria, Adhru'at and Jericho. 'Umar-Ibn-UL-Khattab may

God be satisfied with him - expelled the last of them in his reign from Hijaz to Taima'

and Jericho.</font></p>
