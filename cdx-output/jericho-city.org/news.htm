<p align="JUSTIFY" dir="LTR">Back in the ancient times, they used to say that 
health is a crown placed on the heads of healthy men and visible only to ill 
people. Same in Palestine we say that Peace, security and stability is 
considered as a crown placed on the heads of tenths of states, that we in 
Palestine deeply appreciate and yearn for. Not for reasons of development, but 
for our survival and keeper of our lives.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" dir="LTR">I don’t know if you are aware to the fact that in 
the morning when fathers of Palestinian children start the day by attempting to 
attend their jobs that they may not return from usually reach their jobs after 
many hours of intentional insulting and humiliation taking place in the Israeli 
military checkpoints. This applies to school children, academic instructors, 
doctors, and patients.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" dir="LTR">Nowadays, in Europe the borders separating states 
are being removed, but in Palestine the Palestinian land is being divided into 
64 cantons as a result of 125 Israeli military checkpoints. Many years ago In 
Germany, people actually witnessed the demolishing of the Berlin wall, this wall 
was rebuilt in Palestine!!!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" dir="LTR">The Israelis are completely aware that these 
checkpoints are not being established for security reasons whereas if any group 
intended to carry out a military act in Israel will not in any case pass through 
these highly and strictly inspected checkpoints. The reason behind the 
establishment of these checkpoints is to increase the pressure on the 
Palestinian people through creating more sufferings and tortures.</p>
