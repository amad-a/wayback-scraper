<p align="center"><font size="4" color="Blue"><b>Al-Haya Newspaper dated Nov 25. 2000</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">This incident explains the range of the Israeli aggression, and it happened to one of the taxi drivers. As usual this driver drove his passengers from Jericho taking them to Ramallah and since all roads were blocked by the Israeli Army so he had to take a another soil road which connects Jericho with the winding street leads to the settlements where he was caught by an Israeli Patrol, the passengers were ordered to get off the vehicle and were detained for many hours, thus the driver was severely beaten by the soldiers,  and was ordered by one of the officers to kiss the ranks which cover his shoulders, the driver refused and randomly was beaten after each request and each refusal. Then he was fined and had to pay 1000 Israeli Shekels. His driving license was confiscated claiming he broke the imposed siege.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">The other incident as I can say makes you laugh and cry at the same time and it happened to one of the Palestinian workers who was captured on the same above mentioned road, he was accused of being a stone thrower, the worker denied and said that he is just a poor worker, goes in the morning to his work and comeback home at night, suddenly the soldier picked up a stone and ordered the worker to hit his head, the worker refused, the soldier insisted but the worker who knows if he does it he will be shot down and the worker strongly refused. All of a sudden the soldier ordered him again to throw the stone up in the air to see whether the worker is one of the stone throwers or not, the poor worker picked up the stone and threw it in the air, and right at that minute a poor bird was flying on the same spot got hit by the stone, then the soldier said: see you hit the bird which means you are a trained stone thrower, the worker said: No, it was by chance. The soldier said: you are a stone sniper and you will pay for it, the soldiers started beating him up severely so he couldn't stand on his feet until the arrival of other workers who helped him out after the departure of the soldiers.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">I was told this funny story by the worker himself whom couldn't stop laughing while telling me the story saying: did you imagine my bad luck when the bird passed by my stone at the same time so I got all the beatings by the soldiers. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="Blue"><b>Palestinian uprising (Intifada)</b></font></p>
<p><b></b><br>
<font size="3">The Palestinian uprising is a public Revolution which includes all the parties of Palestinian society who participate in this uprising against Israeli Occupation to the Arab land for more than 50 years a go and continued until today.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Throughout these long years Palestinians suffered all kinds of oppression, Depression and torture, but the last crime made by Sharon was the reason for the new Uprising..</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Actually, Palestinian people wanted peace particularly, when the "Oslo" agreement was signed between Israelis and Palestinians in 1993, during that time Palestinians believed that the Israeli occupation on the Palestinian land will be vanished and removed therefore Palestinians will achieve their dream of establishing their independent state on all Palestinian land which has been occupied since 1967 and Jerusalem.its Capital </font></p>
<p><font size="3">On the contrary, since the Oslo agreement Israelis had increased their oppression on Palestinian people. Settlements were increased, Israelis demolished our houses, and also they refused to release Palestinian prisoners.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Nowadays because of this uprising the Israelis soldiers put the Palestinians under siege, also Israelis denied Palestinian workers from entering the Green line and restricted their movement.  </font></p>
<p><font size="3">Actually, all of these measures made by Israeli Government caused disappointments and depressions among Palestinian people who preferred being dead and to be martyrs than this difficult situation, so the second uprising started it thus will continue until the freedom and liberation, which all the Palestinians aspire.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">We hope that this Intifada give us the opportunities to achieve our goals in establishing our independent State.</font></p>
