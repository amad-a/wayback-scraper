<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>Mayor Sider Speech during the declaration of the 
annual report of UNICEF that took place in the municipal theatre in Jericho:</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Special representative of UNICEF in Palestine, Mr.Pierre Boupard,<br>
Director of the ministry of education office in the governorate of Jericho, Mr. 
Mohammed Ewidat,<br>
Principals and Teachers of the city schools.<br>
Directors of Departments and governmental and non-governmental institutions in 
the city,<br>
Chairman of the child municipal council, <br>
Members in the administrative board and consultative assemblies in the child 
municipal council,<br>
Brothers and sisters Dear children,<br>
<br>
Today we meet in this special occasion (the declaration of the UNICEF annual 
report).<br>
To explain and confirm one point to the whole world, and that is the children of 
Palestine didn’t choose to get themselves killed or expose their bodies to the 
canons of tanks, and didn’t decide to consider rocks and stones as their 
favorite toys instead of balls. <br>
We came here today to assure that the children of Palestine do not adore living 
as orphans or parentless or even making their parents live in sadness and grieve 
for the loss of a child.<br>
In this occasion we address the whole world and we accentuate that the children 
of Palestine didn’t happily choose to play with burning tires instead of playing 
with sand and with plastic parts to be assembled.<br>
They also didn’t choose to climb up electric and telephone shafts to affix their 
country’s flag instead of climbing up swings and seesaws.<br>
The Palestinian children do not adore affixing the picture of the martyr 
Muhammad Al- Dura while being shot dead in the arms of his father in classes and 
sleeping rooms instead of hanging the pictures of Disney land heroes.<br>
The children of Palestine never chose to carry the dead bodies of their 
schoolmates and relatives and neighbors on their shoulders,.<br>
They didn’t have the choice whether to visit cemeteries during the happy 
occasion of Eid, instead of visiting public gardens and amusement centers.<br>
<br>
Never chose willingly to plant roses in cemeteries instead of planting them in 
gardens in the houses where occupiers spread all kind of grieve and sadness and 
different types of tortures and made them water these roses with their tears.<br>
Mr. Boupard the special representative of UNICEF all the children all over the 
world have one language exactly the same as deaf people have one sign language, 
never hindered by nationality or color or sex, the children of Palestine are a 
harmonious tune of the symphony of children the world,<br>
But what rendered their lives was a strong reason and that was behind the change 
of their alternatives.<br>
From this point we demand that you would exert more efforts to bring back 
harmony to the symphony of children of the world.<br>
Mr. Boupard, the children of Jericho with whom you had a special experience that 
lasted for several years and was represented by the child municipal council, 
sets a very important example and proof, that the first alternative for the 
children of Palestine is just to be children.<br>
In addition to that, your practical experience with the Jericho municipality 
during these years, was an obvious proof that the local administration and 
decision-makers in the field are so concerned and fully cooperative in relation 
to the protection and well being of children. And their growing up in a safe and 
convenient environment, after all we only want them to be children.<br>
On the internal and local level here in the city of Jericho. And after the great 
success of the child municipal council experience, that you had a great impact 
in making it a success, Childcare has acquired more attention in the Jericho 
municipality, and in the department of Education, and in schools.<br>
Also, the new experience of “child friendly cities”, will raise awareness for 
the necessity of child- care, among other vast groups not mentioned before, such 
as drivers, merchants, governmental institutions, and a large number of 
individuals,<br>
The Jericho municipality had practically commenced a set of procedures and steps 
directed for making Jericho, a child friendly city.<br>
Perhaps establishing a child center by the municipality with a total cost of 300 
thousand dollars is one of the vivid and firm steps in this strategic path taken 
by the Jericho municipality.We are totally aware that our project will not come 
to a success unless we combine the efforts of several sectors, some of which are 
children, local administration, civil and governmental institutions, residents, 
and locals in general.<br>
This will make the municipality’s required effort huge and hard.<br>
But we are determined and insistent to reach the top of success and to stay 
there.<br>
Mr. Boupard, we at the Jericho municipality, civil institutions, parents, and 
children of Jericho, declare and confirm our full commitment to proceed ahead to 
make the city of Jericho, a child friendly city.<br>
We are taking this path and will not fall back<br>
Peace, love, and security should prevail in the end in the fields of our 
precious country, <br>
The language of children of Palestine should be in harmony with the language of 
children of the civilized world.<br>
The choices and alternatives of the Palestinian children should be the same as 
the choices and alternatives of children of the world.<br>
Please allow us to thank you Mr. Boupard for your support.<br>
We also thank the department of Education, educational institutions in the city, 
and teachers,<br>
We thank the civil and governmental and non- governmental institutions for 
cooperation and support,<br>
Parents, residents, locals, for support and encouragement.<br>
Adorable students:<br>
You are the horse that we bet on so don’t stumble,<br>
