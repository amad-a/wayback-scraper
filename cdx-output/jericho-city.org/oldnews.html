<p align="JUSTIFY">The Mayor of Jericho Mr.Abdel-Karim Sider, said that the 
whole idea of establishing the child Municipal Council in the city of Jericho 
was to practice democracy in reality, he also said that democracy couldn’t be 
taught but should be practiced in real life, and during practical experiences. 
And that our children should practice the experience of democratic elections 
that the Palestinian people were deprived of and democratic values should be 
implanted into them since early childhood.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr.Sider also stressed on the necessity of implanting 
principles of communal responsibility, participation, and belonging. These 
principles as he said are absent in the community lately. The idea of forming 
the child municipal council was a start to implant principles of participation 
of children in the local community and widening the intellectual abilities of 
children by encouraging reading and engaging in issues related to children.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr.Sider said that one of the main concerns and priorities of 
the of the child council is determining a set of messages to children and to all 
sectors of the community and working on implementing them on the ground. And 
working on organizing competitions to evaluate the extent to which these 
messages are being implemented.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This meeting organized by the municipality is considered a 
new mechanism in-order to allow the participation of parents in the municipal 
council activities and making them observe the accomplishments that had been 
made. Mr.Sider emphasized on the necessity of enhancing the relations between 
the parents and the Municipality. He said that parents should participate in the 
different activities, programs, and proposals submitted by the Municipality 
towards the child council. He proposed electing a special committee formed from 
the parents to follow- up the council and meet the rest of the parents and 
arrange other future meetings.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">From the other hand, the parents welcomed the idea of making 
such meetings and stressed on their will to participate in the activities 
conducted by the children and helping them to emanate new ideas.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">One of these suggestions that have been proposed by the 
parents was to form a special committee from the child council. To have 
relations and visit the education and governmental institutions, to illustrate 
ideas about the problems and concerns of children and to observe the policy 
taken by these institutions regarding children. And documenting them in-order to 
find a solution and insure the participation of the whole city institutions in 
the city in the process of development.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">From the other hand, the children valued and recommended the 
role played by the municipality and its efforts to reach the best- results 
expected from the idea of establishing a child Municipal Council. They also 
stressed on the necessity for reaching the participation of parents and family 
and engaging them in all the activities and programs of the Child Council.</p>

<font face="Simplified Arabic" size="2">In March 18 , 2003, and as part of the Municipal 
library in Jericho, a CD section in the Municipal library was officially opened 
under the disposal of the subscribers; the opening was attended by a number of 
concerned parties, school teachers, library subscribers, municipal council 
members, and municipality personnel. Deputy Mayor, Dr. Ali Husseini, has cut the 
strip declaring the opening of the CD section and all the guests took a tour 
around.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#008080">Project concept:</font><br>
The idea came up as there was a rising need among the young people in the city 
of Jericho of using Hi- Tec and a necessity of facilitating information access 
for everyone. Especially to an important group and that is children and youth, 
the municipality desire was to be in a leading position in the Information, 
Technology, and Computer Field. For this reason the administration thought that 
adding a CD section in the municipal library is an essential step, as this kind 
of tech<img border="0" src="/jericho-city.org/images/news.h5.jpg" align="left" width="240" height="156">nology 
is distinguished from any other being the language of the world. During a visit 
of the head of the information technology section to the city of Nantes in 
France within a cooperation program with French municipalities, the idea was 
proposed and adopted by the Jerusalem- Gaza Loirre association. This association 
kindly donated a sum of 15000 French Franks for implementing this project.<br>
<font color="#008080">
<br>
&nbsp;</font></font></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr">
<font face="Simplified Arabic" size="2">
<font color="#008080">
Procedures for implementing this project:</font><br>
As soon as the invoice for purchasing the CDs was issued and was sent to the 
Loirre association for approval, a set of steps were taken as soon as money was 
transferred, where there was an invitation for a bid. And under the supervision 
of The Mayor Mr.Abdel-Karim Sider and in cooperation with the IT and purchasing 
section a set of exclusive CDs was purchased from a high standard CD company. In 
addition to a CD writer and Empty CDs.<br>
500 different CDs where purchased covering various topics and each one had a 
similar copy issued.<br>
From the other hand, the Jericho Municipality contributed in paying a sum of 
3000 NIS about 600$ US for designing and working out a CD cabinet, for 
exhibiting the CDs and facilitating the process of Choosing and borrowing. Two 
computers were put under the disposal of the library subscribers for the use of 
these CDs inside the library.<br>
<br>
<font color="#008080">
<br>
The Targeted Group:</font><br>
The CDs where chosen to suit the users from the ages of 6 – and above.<br>
<br>
<font color="#008080">Types of CDs:</font><br>
1- Scientific – 25 CD<br>
2- Cultural and recreational – 54 CD<br>
3- Recreational for children – 15 CD<br>
4- Children – oriented ( educational, games) -53 CD<br>
5- Applied programs and photos – 27 CD<br>
6- religious – 50 CD<br>
7- Historical and Geographical 15 CD<br>
8- Medical – 12<br>
9- children And Fun – 8 CD<br>
<br>
<font color="#008080">The borrowing procedures: </font><br>
A special procedure for lending the CDs was used , it was adopted as to suit the 
municipal library policies, it involves the necessity of the borrower to be a 
member in the library. <br>
The membership card will be claimed and the fact that this particular member 
intending to borrow a CD is listed in his membership card. In case this CD was 
damaged or lost the borrower should pay a fine of about 12 NIS (2.5 $ U.S) a 
copy of this damaged CD will be made in the Library, in the Future, the 
Municipality thinks of installing a digital lending system.<br>
<br>
<font color="#008080">Classification of the CDs:</font><br>
<img border="0" src="/jericho-city.org/images/news.h14.jpg" width="212" height="160" align="left">The CDs are classified according to the topic and programs. In accordance with a 
special classification system that was implemented by the Library personnel, a 
special colored sticker was fixed on the CD cover to indicate the topic it 
belongs to, which will help reaching the wanted CD.<br>
<br>
This step has made the Jericho Municipality a pioneer as the municipal library 
will be the only one in the city that offers such services, this section will 
help in expanding the intellectual capacities of children, students, and adults 
and will help in communicating information.<br>
<br>
<font color="#008080">Future plans:</font><br>
<br>
As the Jericho Municipality has recently signed an agreement for the 
establishment of a new library with ANERA (Near east refugee Aid) project funded 
by USAID it is expected that such a CD section will be expanded more and will 
include more CD topics and specialized programs.</font></p>

the cooperation program implemented by the Jericho Municipality and French 
consulate general in Jerusalem, the Jericho Municipality hosted Professor Armel 
Huet Head of the Planning department in the University of Rennes in France 
together with a delegation composed of French academics. The delegation met the 
Mayor of Jericho Mr. Abdel- Karim Sider with participation of Eng. Basel Hijazi 
Director of the Engineering department in Jericho Municipality and Miss Weam 
Erekat Director of Public Relations department. In that meeting, both parties 
discussed the different ways of cooperation between the city of Jericho and the 
city and university of Rennes in order to make future planning for the city of 
Jericho. The delegation was briefed about the current situation in the city and 
the city planning maps and schemes. They also had an idea about the usage of 
residential, commercial, and agricultural areas in the city. Some major points 
were agreed on during this meeting such as the city development project on both 
the short and long term and the study grants that will be provided for the 
Jericho Municipality by the University of Rennes in the field of Urban Planning. 
From the other hand, the Municipality will start collecting data for conducting 
social studies according to which the Planning scheme will be based on.</font></p><font size="2">
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:kashida;
text-kashida:0%;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">After that, the delegation was 
escorted in a tour around the entrances to the city where they had a look at the 
nature of houses, extended areas, areas that had been annexed to be within the 
municipality boundaries, and locations of some future projects the municipality 
intends to execute.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:kashida;
text-kashida:0%;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">In addition to that, the 
Municipality of Jericho organized a workshop in the Municipality hall; in that 
workshop Professor Huet gave a lecture about the importance of working to 
achieve planning and organization for the city. Many national and governmental 
institutions representatives attended this workshop. Professor Huet explained 
that planning will have a lot of economic, cultural, and social positive 
reflects on the residents in general. Dr. Huet gave examples about this 
referring to Brittany county and the city of Rennes. These areas as he said were 
considered underdeveloped comparing with other cities, but after organizing and 
planning took place they became one of the advanced areas in many aspects.</p>
</font><p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:kashida;
text-kashida:0%;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><font size="2">On the other hand Professor 
Huet expressed the importance of the availability of a vision emanating from the 
citizens about the future of their city and<font face="Simplified Arabic" size="2"><img border="0" src="/jericho-city.org/images/arabic6.jpg" width="230" height="148" align="left"></font>

the aspects that could be highlighted in the development plan. He also stressed 
on the necessity of all the institutions to participate in the process of 
planning and also their support to such projects as they will not succeed unless 
there was an institutional and public cooperation for supporting them.</font><font size="4"></font></p><font size="4">
<font size="2">

<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:kashida;
text-kashida:0%;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">Dr. Huet concluded his lecture 
by recommending the position that the city of Jericho occupys on the 
international level as being the oldest city in the world thus a great 
responsibility lies on the residents for its not a national responsibility only 
but an international one that needs all the parties to cooperate for developing 
and organizing the city. </p>
