Article (25):</font><br>
This bylaw shall operate starting the day it becomes approved by the child 
municipal council and shall not be amended without the agreement of the child 
municipal council.<br>
<br>
<font color="#008080">Annex illustrating the child municipal council Bylaw</font><br>
<br>
As a result of the need for an amendment for the child municipal council bylaw 
in its 1999 term (it only included 6th grade, also the inability for the 
municipality to conduct elections in the year 2000 and 2001 due to Israeli 
reoccupation of the Palestinian territories).<br>
The Jericho municipality in coordination with the UNICEF has amended the child 
municipal council bylaw taking into consideration the remarks that were sent to 
the Jericho municipality from other involved institutions. These remarks 
encompassed the necessity to involve students of less academic attainments.<br>
In addition to that, there was an obvious necessity for the member to 
participate for more than one year. As a result, the Jericho municipality and 
the UNICEF have convened several meetings to discuss these suggested amendments. 
Finally, the bylaw was approved in its current form.<br>
2- In order to pass the experience from the former members in the council to the 
new ones, the Jericho municipality found it essential to keep the old members in 
the council elected in the preceding term in 1999. These will become members in 
the new council without being elected which will consequently make them members 
in the general assembly. On the other hand, elections will be carried out to 
elect members from grades 7 and 8 for the consultative and administrative board. 
(Students in the 9th grade have been elected in the year 1999) and their 
duration will be for this year only.<br>
3- in the coming years and in the beginning of each academic year, internal 
elections will be organized to elect students from the 7th grade only, where the 
old 7th grade students will replace the 8th grade in the council, and the 8th 
grade students will replace the 9th grade. These replaced 9th grade students 
will have their membership terminated.<br>
4- after electing new members in the consultative assembly in the beginning of 
each year,( this will only include the students in the 7th grade), the students 
in the 7th grade in all schools and in general elections will elect one student 
from each school to represent them in the administrative board in the child 
council. These elected students will replace the students of the old 9th grade 
who will be terminated from the council's administrative board.<br>
5- The members of the administrative board for this year will consist of:<br>
a- members of the administrative board for the child municipal council elected 
in 1999 (students of the 9th grade).<br>
b- One representative on behalf of each class (7th and 8th grades) from the 
participating schools in the administrative board.<br>
c- in addition to 50% of the number of the represented students in section (b) 
in this paragraph where the elections shall include the sections (a and b) in 
this paragraph, for example if the number of the 7th and 8th grade students in 
all the participating schools was 9 classes there should be an additional 9 
members representing all classes which will be submitted to general elections, 
In addition to 50% of the number 9, which is the number of students representing 
the classes.( in case of an odd number it will be approximated to the higher 
even number) for ex. 9+5 = 14 student from the consultative assembly will be 
elected to be appointed in the administrative board. When counting the votes, 
50% will be offered to those with the highest results, and after that one 
representative for each class will be elected according to the highest votes he 
or she obtains.<br>
6- Persistently and in the coming years the number of the administrative board 
members in the council will consist of:<br>
a- The members that were elected previously in grades 7 and 8.<br>
b- The members that will be elected at the beginning of each academic year. In 
the consultative assembly, in general elections organized for all the 7th grade 
students in all schools on the condition that there will be one representative 
for each school ( only for 7th grade) in addition to 50%, for ex. If the number 
of the 7th grade classes in Jericho schools was 10 the general elections will 
run to elect 10+5= 15 students to be members in the administrative board. This 
will continue for the next coming years.<br>
<br>
7- concerning the internal elections in schools and in case there was more than 
one section for each class the elections will run so as to include all the 
sections altogether where all the students will participate as a whole and shall 
have the right of electing and nomination.<br>
<br>
8- The number of sections for each class has no relation to the number of 
representatives in the internal elections for the consultative assembly or in 
the general elections for the administrative board (the same number of 
representatives for everybody).<br>
