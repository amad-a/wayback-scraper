<center><h1>Current Events: Why, How, What, When, Who and 
Where?</h1></center> [draft] (see also <a href="/palestine-net.com/news/index.html" style="">News 
section</a> for more background info and developments)
<p>It is late afternoon in Ramallah, a town not far from Alquds 
(Jerusalem) 
and this Palestinian woman in her early 40s is waiting nervously in front of
the hospital, makeshift stretchers piled up near the door and occupation
gunships hovering above in the sky. Her two school kids are not back yet
and she fears they are both inside.</p><p>
Is this the preferred lifestyle in Palestine? Do Palestinian ladies bring up
their kids to be consumed by Israeli bullets sponsored, usually, by the free
world? Are we created differently and with less emphasis on the value of our
lives?</p><p>
The <b>Palestinian answer</b> to all above questions is <b>no, and a 
thousand times, no</b>. Of course, the occupation and its sponsors think, or
pretend to think, differently and they do act accordingly.</p><p>
It is not easy to set a recent time or space marker and say it all 
started 
then and there. In fact, it is naive to do that and it would be no more 
than advertising one's ignorance. Following the first Intifada (Dec., 8, 
1987, then ignited by what could have easily be termed a <i>tragic car 
accident</i>) and six years of blood and tears - while the rest of the 
world was watching - there came Oslo I (Sept., 13, 93) then Oslo II and 
other side meetings.</p><p>
Those who were familiar with situation on the ground in Palestine, Mr 
Arafat 
not included, and read Oslo_I carefully, realized then that the Palestinians
were promised a bad lemon and they have to work hard to get it (then, we used
the term "political condom" to refer to Oslo and still haven't changed 
our minds).</p><p>
Oslo was nothing but a mechanism of resetting the timer of an ever 
exploding 
time bomb. There are only 24 hours of manuevering and you have to reset 
it 
before the critical tick. This is, of course, a vulnerable strategy since
the oppressed also have access to the ticking clock and when the pistons 
press
too hard on them they get squeezed beyond patience and guess what? They reset
the clock to the dislike of the oppressors and it'll be too late to 
diffuse 
the situation.</p><p>
That is exactly what happened recently. For various reasons, the Palestinians
in general swallowed the humiliation they got from the legacy of Oslo. Having
been tired from six years of struggle and saw the indifference of the 
official
international community and the blunders of those who appointed 
themselves as leaders and wanted to reap the results of their struggle 
and 
having realized the non-existence of a responsible alternative to the PA, 
 ... the immediate
reaction to Oslo was hard to gauge. There were different interpretations 
(most
Palestinians are not that good understanding the play on words in English)
and some thought it is a beginning, it is guaranteed by the big shots and it
was signed in front of the world, it was done in the 90s and so on and so 
forth.</p><p>
Oslo failed to address principles vital for a peaceful settlement and it was
about avoiding these more than anything else. Mr Arafat acted on his own 
and 
received political baptism at the white house without consulting "his" 
people.
In short, Oslo came to serve two particular purposes: <b>First</b>: to 
re-set the
timer on the Palestinian time bomb and rid the Israeli forces from having
to do the dirty work chasing Palestinain demonstartors. <b>Second</b>: to 
perform
a plastic surgery and improve the Isareli picture in the region and 
internationally, hence paving the road toward an <b>open</b> arab-israeli 
cooperation. It would be better for Israeli prime ministers to walk in 
the 
streets of arab capitals and establish companies and embassies there rather
than holding meetings in secret and having to re-label products before 
they are shipped to arab markets.</p><p>
Of course, as dispalyed on CNN and other world TV channels and in shing 
articles in the political tabloids, things looked so
great. People shaking hands, others clapping, the big guys pledging support
and assistance to rebuild confidence, economy, welfare, human rights ... 
you 
name it. What materialized on ground? Almost nothing as far as the 
average 
Palestinian is concerned. Life went from bad to worse. The Israelis squeezed
the lemon and delayed handing it for more and more compromises and they got
all of those. The donors (came to be known in Palestine by the Arabic name:
<i>ad-duwal al-maniHah</i> then changed cynically to <i>ad-duwal 
al-maliHa</i> 
(the one consonant changes meaning to salty nations instead od donor 
nations)) had little interest in paying those sums of money without 
seeing 
quick results and as usual, talking is much easier than actions, plus for 
many states, it wasn't them who brought misery to the region, so why 
should 
they be responsible for the clean up when those who made the mess are not 
held accountable?
</p><p>
Under the late Y. Rabin (well known among Palestinian kids for his policy of
breaking their bones during the Intifada), the Labor party continued the 
policy of expansion on the expence of palestinian land and resources, 
building
settlements, demolishing Palestinian houses, uprooting trees, zionizing 
Jerusalem, administrative detention, liquidation
of those against Oslo and delaying implimentation with lots of talks about
peace, keeping low profile on the internal policy and stretching hands to 
arab regimes for <i>peace and prosperity</i>. Various "breakthroughs" on 
this last
fronts were achieved with exclusive Israeli profit and more misery for the
participating countries.</p><p>
 Time was approaching for the Israeli election campaign and the Likud 
wanted 
to prepare for it as early as they can. It was obvious the Labor will win
again as they engineered Israeli control over the Middle East without waging
another war and without any significant concession. The camapaign kicked off
with bitter langauge against Rabin and his followers and the extreme right
took it seriously. They finished Rabin as a first step. Peres stepped in but
was less popular as he did not have enough Palestinian blood on his hands as
the late Rabin did. He continued Rabin's policy to press Arafat to do him 
some 
favours and crack down on those against Oslo. At that time, Arafat (who 
is a
good survivor) was talking to his opponents (most of whom lack political 
vision and act irresponsibly or like amateurs) to re-organize the 
Palestinian 
house and make his life a bit easier (in preperation for that council 
elections)
and in fact made some progress. For a 
few months there was barely an incident against the occupation as part of an
unwritten agreement between Arafat and his rivals in preperation for the
so called legislative council elections. Life was still getting worse and 
people were waiting, patiently, for the promised paradise brought by the 
council and those shiny campaigning leaflets promising the impossible.</p><p>

On January 6, 1996, the Israelis assasinated Yahya Ayyash, nicknamed the 
Engineer and blamed for manufacturing suicide bombs. Ayyash was hiding in 
Gaza and the Israelis planted a bomb in a cell phone he used. They did it
remotely from a heliocopter plane that hovered over Arafat-controlled 
Gaza. 
By that time, they
have already liquidated other Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza either
by car bombs or by destroying hideouts with anti-tank rockets. </p><p>
That was an add-on to the frustration and betrayal felt by the average 
Palestinian still waiting for deliverence from the upcoming council. 
Ayyash was seen as a legend during the Intifada and is known to 
the Palestinians as the person who put a price tag on the life of a 
Palestinian by replying in kind to Israeli killings. Unlike Abu Jihad (
assasinated in Tunis during the Intifada), Ayyash lived among Palestinians
and his death generated even more anger and added more 
tension 
to the situation. On January 20, Legeslative council elections took place
and, of course, brought a modest mid-east style victory to Mr Arafat (his
was not 99.9% as scored by the rest of the guys, it was a modest 88.8% or 
something like that). </p><p>
On Feb., 12, 1996, the Israelis closed the autonomy areas (once more) and 
prevented traffic and workers from crossing the "green line". That was 
not 
the first time. In fact, closure became the rule and <i>relatively free 
movements</i> was 
the exception (around Feb., 15 was 40 days since the assasination of 
Ayyash). 
That closure remained till February, 25th, 1996 when the Iaraelis 
decided to lift the closure. Feb., 25th is, of course, the anniversary of the
Israeli massacre at the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron (Al-Khalil). Shortly after
the order, a bus exploded in Jerusalem followed by around three more bombings
in different parts of Palestine the following couple of days. Closure was 
re-imposed the same day and workers were turned back. More collective 
punishment came when Israelis imposed curfew on Palestinian towns and 
villages and prevented movement between them.</p><p>
Arafat was asked (by Peres and Clinton) to round up Hamas, Islamic Jihad 
and 
leftist opposition (who are usually enlisted by the media alongside Hamas 
and Islamic Jihad these days). Arafat did a good job. He rounded hundreds
and put them in jail without trial. Many, including college students, are 
still in jail up to this moment. Arafat quickly <i>found</i> those who 
recruited suicide bombers and had them tell stories on PA radio and TV 
(if you believe that) but to the Israelis, that was not enough. 
The Israelis continued their oppressive
measures and delayed redeployment from parts of Hebron and the right wing 
had what they wanted: an atmosphere to call an early election and preach 
security (there was a serious debate on Israeli involvement, directly or 
otherwise, in those last bombings). So, there came the early Israeli 
elections which brought the right wing to power by a tiny margin  
three months after the bombings.</p><p>
The closure remained, workers were imported from the Far East to replace 
the 
Palestinian (cheap) workforce and unemployment rocketed to more than 60%. For
many Palestininas, survival meant earning enough money to afford meals on 
a 
daily basis. Those who had savings spent them and ended up grounded. Entry
to work places long ago required extensive screening and ability to get 
one 
of those sacred magnetice cards, now there is nothing. The PA had little 
to 
do and little to offer. Their resources were low, help from the donors still
did not materialize and only a few millions arrived. All country 
resources 
are under Israeli control, there is no social 
security that helps the unemployed and basically, most Palestinians, many 
of 
whom under 30 years of age, were sentenced to a slow death by starvation.
</p><p>
Once Bibi was inaugurated for president, he had to please his supporters, 
many of whom are fanatic extreme right wingers, so he decided to tighten
the rope around the Palestinains' neck and to let it be known campaign 
style. Those silk gloves used by the Labor were not necessary. There was 
no 
redeployment in Hebron, the Palestinian women prisoners were not 
released, 
land confiscation continued, house demolitions became a daily dose for 
Palestinians and olive grooves were bulldozed on a daily basis to make 
room 
for 
so many by-pass roads. Administrative detention continued and daily 
provocation went on at higher levels. Unlike Labor, settlement policies 
were announced in the media rather than in secret, zionizing Jerusalem 
was 
an advertised policy with eviction of Palestinian quarters, demolishing 
of 
scores of homes and establishments, humiliation of Palestinians, including
police, at roadblocks and blocking worshippers from entering Jerusalem 
for the 
last six months.</p><p>
It was this build up that led to the explosion. Those who listened to people
in Palestine commenting on the general situation in the last few weeks
would have heard the word <i>second Intifada<i> frequently. Even those 
interviewed on PA's TV did not hide it. When asked they usually say: "things
are going from bad to worse, there is likely to be a second Intifada". The
provocations in Jerusalem were not new. Digging has been performed long ago
and in different places. Various attempts to destroy the mosque were launched
by "crazy" people who travelled from as afr as Australia to pick the 
mosque 
for their "crazy" target practice. It was burned in 1969, attacked 
several 
times in the 80s and 90s (including a recent 
rocket attack that was fioled). Changing the features of the city has 
been 
going on with a race against time, but it took a different dimension lately.
</i></i></p><p><i><i>The opening of the tunnel and the way it took place was but the straw that
broke the camel's back. It was the minimum ignition needed to put afire that
time bomb that almost ticked its zeroth hour. Everything was there ready 
to go
and those who could were not interested in diffusing it. The same story 
with 
the car "accident" nine years ago repeated itself.</i></i></p><p><i><i>
Did Mr Arafat take credit for "inciting" it? No. In the first place, Mr 
Arafat is still to release hundreds of political detainees held without
trial or even charges against them, for no other reason but to please the 
Israelis. The recent revelation about corruption in the PA (made news in 
daily papers in Palestine earlier this month) and violation
of human rights among others are the things expected from Mr Arafat to 
put 
the Palestinian house in order (if he really wants and have the authority 
to do it). So, why did he call for the three day strike?
Good question. The answer is: what if he did not call for it? In fact, 
this 
is not the first time he calls for a strike (and it ws just a simple, 
commercial strike: businesses close their doors and that's it). From a 
survival point of view, one way of "leading" is to move in the direction 
where you expet the flow to be. One other good survivor in the Middle 
East 
grew a beard and became a saint during the gulf war. Now the same guy 
trusts the CIA who use him and 
report his activities to their buddy Saddam Hussein after his role is 
over.</i></i></p><p><i><i>
So, there was a protest and the usual kind of confrontations known in 
Palestine. People vent their anger, throw stones on Israeli jeeps and 
roadblocks then go home. A couple of days later, things are back to normal.
But why it was different this time? The situation on the ground changed a 
little: people had to walk a few hundred yards outside the towns (area A 
acording to the Oslo II convention) to find a <i>pure</i>
Israeli roadblock. The responsibilty to keep them away is that of 
Palestinian police who did try their best, but apparently couldn't help it.
At al-ma'luufiyyah roadblock near Ramallah, the Palestinians marched 
toward the roadblock, reportedly manned by 4 Israeli soldiers. Those guys 
called for reinforcements (not far away as those who are familiar with 
the 
place know very well) and decided to defend the cement blocks no matter 
what. 
On the other front, Palestinian police is trying desperately to keep the 
Palestinians away but no one listens to them. Fearing for their life (and 
disciplinary actions by Bibi's generals), the Israelis fire at the crowd 
and some members of the Palestinian
police (encouraged by the masses and the emotion of the situation) fire back
and a battle erupts. Israelis bring their tanks and gunships and spray fire
on Ramallah then advance <i>only a few hundred yards inside !</i>and the 
news spread like fire and clashes erupt in different parts of the 
country. 
Arafat calls on his police to cease fire but it was too late. He claims 
control over some 80% of them, the rest are either fighting for their 
lives 
or already joined the angry masses. It must be said that the Palestinian 
police is credited for success in minimizing losses and taking their own 
while protecting stranded Israeli soldiers (an example is the 42 soldiers 
rescued in Nablus). 
[For the record, Palestinian Police are issued 30 bullets each, have no 
helmets or bullet-proof vests and use out-dated Russian AK-47s which, 
with their ammo, are inventoried by the Israeli forces under the Oslo 
accords. It doesn't require rocket engineering to know that a gunfight 
against tanks, armored vehicles and gunships is disastrous. See also <a href="/palestine-net.com/news/quotes.txt" style="pointer-events: none;">quotes by members of police and others</a>] </i></i></p><p><i><i>
Of course, the Isarelis are very good at reformatting the story. Those 
who 
have enough memory to recall the latest massacre in Qana (Lebanon) 
remember 
those video game screens they showed to convince the world they are innocent
and can't be blamed for it. They had more than one version of the story 
and 
you pick what suits you: One was hiding in a building and fired at them 
first;
Hamas implants in PA police started firing and it was a plot; they (Israelis)
started it but with rubber 
bullets (they also used rubber bullets only when they stormed Al-Aqsa on 
Friday. Then you ask: how come rubber bullets fracture the skulls of victims
and blow them apart? Well, this is the land of miracles - you know). </i></i></p><p><i><i>

So, where are we heading? Shall the tunnel be closed (for now)? Shall the two
guys (Arafat and Netanyahu) sit together and "calm down" the situation? Shall
the donors send more checks? more ambulances amd medication? More painting
or paving of a street here and a sewege system there? Or shall the Israeli
government stop "stalking" the Palestinians and every body shuts up and 
wait 
for the next round of violence? And 
more than anything else, how come this happens without the high tech and 
official media even predicting or hinting it may happen? Were they silent all
the time during the hypernation process to give the readers more excitement?
How much should the average international citizen know or care about the 
situation? And from how many sources?</i></i></p><p><i><i>
The root to the conflict is not digging here or there. These are elements 
in the build up toward disaster but are not the foundations of the problem.
There are essential principal issues that need to be addressed and in due 
time. Those involved know all of this and this is not the place to list 
the 
basic requirements for a true, stable and lasting peace. The concequences 
of ignoring the sensitivity of this issue may reflect on the world as 
a whole. It is so easy for the situation to explode anywhere in the 
Middle East at a very short notice, and the latest incidents are the 
bitter reminder.</i></i></p><p><i><i>
On the scale of the international community, the responsibility (abandoned
by policy makers) lies upon the shoulders of you - world citizens - 
especially
if your tax money is used to finance misery and death in Palestine and 
elsewhere in the third world. Most dictators and occupation regimes are 
supported and financed by 
the free, democratic, civilized and industrial world. The media is 
"covering" 
the truth by painting false or half truths and it is time to ask both the 
policy makers and news makers (manipulators) to act responsibly and 
invest 
in real peace and build international bridges of trust and understanding 
rather 
than maintain a policy that prosper on disaster. You have the magic keys 
to stop bad things from happening before they do. The middle 
east is in need of fire extinguishers, not assistance to fan out the flames.
