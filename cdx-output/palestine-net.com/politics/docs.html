secured by public law.
 The congress contemplates the following means to the attainment of this

Palestine by 
Jewish agricultural and industrial workers.
<b>2.</b> The organization and binding together of the whole Jewry by 
means of 
appropriate institutions, local and international, in acordance with the 
laws of each country.
<b>3.</b> The strengthening and fostering of Jewish national sentiment and
counsciousness.
<b>4.</b> Preparatory steps towards obtaining government consent, where 
necessary, to the attainment of the aim of Zionism."

<h2>The Balfour Declaration: Nov., 2, 1917</h2>
" Dear Lord Rithchild,
	I have much pleasure in conveying to you, on behalf of His Majesty's
Government, the following declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist
aspirations which has been submitted to, and approved by, the Cabinet.
	<em>His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in
Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best
endeavours tofacilitate the achievenment of this object, it being clearly 
understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and 
religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the 
rights
and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.</em>
	I should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the 
knowledge of the Zionist Federation.
		Signed: Arthur James Balfour"
