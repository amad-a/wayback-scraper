<center><b>Intifada2000 - Peaceful Resistance Against Israeli Occupation</b></center>
<br>
Welcome to Intifada2000!<br>
You can help this little boy resist the Israeli occupation at <u>no cost</u>.<br>
At least, you can clear your conscience and make sure you are <u>not paying</u> the bills of these death machines (Note: this boy, according to local Palestinian papers, said goodbye to our world, thanks to Israeli bullets, on November 8th. ).

<li> Do you buy from (or do business with) companies that subsidise the Israeli occupation? For example, AT&amp;T; will host the site for Israeli Occupation Forces. Answer? Switch your phone company. Sprint and MCI are good alternatives</li> 
<li> Do you read/listen to/view one-sided coverage of events? Ask to see the other side of the coin. After all, it's your right to be well-informed.</li> 
<li> Does your government use your tax money to finance or subsidise the Israeli occupation? Write/call your representative and ask them to invest the money in more human projects like local education, environment, national health insurance or housing</li> 
<li> Don't you have family and friends? Ask them to do the same</li> 

</ul>
