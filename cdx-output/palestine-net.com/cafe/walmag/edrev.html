God Has Ninety-Nine Names: Reporting From a Militant Middle  East.
By Judith Miller
Simon &amp; Schuster [1996]. 574 pp. $30.<br>

Judith Miller is a New York Times reporter much in evidence on talk
shows
and seminars on the Middle East. She trades in "the Islamic threat" --
her
particular mission has been to advance the millennial thesis that
militant
Islam is a danger to the West. The search for a post-Soviet foreign
devil
has come to rest, as it did beginning in the eighth century for
European
Christendom, on Islam, a religion whose physical proximity and
unstilled
challenge to the West seem as diabolical and violent now as they did
then.
Never mind that most Islamic countries today are too poverty-stricken,
tyrannical and hopelessly inept militarily as well as scientifically to
be
much of a threat to anyone except their own citizens; and never mind
that
the most powerful of them -- like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and
Pakistan
-- are totally within the U.S. orbit. What matters to "experts" like
Miller, Samuel Huntington, Martin Kramer, Bernard Lewis, Daniel Pipes,
Steven Emerson and Barry Rubin, plus a whole battery of Israeli
academics,
is to make sure that the "threat" is kept before our eyes, the better
to
excoriate Islam for terror, despotism and violence, while assuring
themselves profitable consultancies, frequent TV appearances and book
contracts. The Islamic threat is made to seem disproportionately
fearsome,
lending support to the thesis (which is an interesting parallel to
anti-Semitic paranoia) that there is a worldwide conspiracy behind
every
explosion.<p>

Political Islam has generally been a failure wherever it has tried to
take
state power. Iran is a possible exception, but neither Sudan, already
an
Islamic state, nor Algeria, riven by the contest between Islamic groups
and
a brutal soldiery, has done anything but make itself poorer and more
marginal on the world stage. Lurking beneath the discourse of Islamic
peril
in the West is, however, some measure of truth, which is that appeals
to
Islam among Muslims have fueled resistance (in the style of what Eric
Hobsbawm has called primitive, pre-industrial rebellion) to the Pax
Americana-Israelica throughout the Middle East. Yet neither Hezbollah
nor
Hamas has presented a serious obstacle to the ongoing steamroller of
the
anything-but-peace process. Most Arab Muslims today are too discouraged
and
humiliated, and also too anesthetized by uncertainty and their
incompetent
and crude dictatorships, to support anything like a vast Islamic
campaign
against the West. Besides, the elites are for the most part in cahoots
with
the regimes, supporting martial law and other extralegal measures
against
"extremists." So why, then, the accents of alarm and fear in most
discussions of Islam? Of course there have been suicide bombings and
outrageous acts of terrorism, but have they accomplished anything
except to
strengthen the hand of Israel and the United States and their client
regimes
in the Muslim world?</p><p>

The answer, I think, is that books like Miller's are symptomatic
because
they are weapons in the contest to subordinate, beat down, compel and
defeat
any Arab or Muslim resistance to U.S.-Israeli dominance. Moreover, by
surreptitiously justifying a policy of single-minded obduracy that
links
Islamism to a strategically important, oil-rich part of the world, the
anti-Islam campaign virtually eliminates the possibility of equal
dialogue
between Islam and the Arabs, and the West or Israel. To demonize and
dehumanize a whole culture on the ground that it is (in Lewis's
sneering
phrase) enraged at modernity is to turn Muslims into the objects of a
therapeutic, punitive attention. I do not want to be misunderstood
here: The
manipulation of Islam, or for that matter Christianity or Judaism, for
retrograde political purposes is catastrophically bad and must be
opposed,
not just in Saudi Arabia, the West Bank and Gaza, Pakistan, Sudan,
Algeria
and Tunisia but also in Israel, among the right-wing Christians in
Lebanon
(for whom Miller shows an unseemly sympathy) and wherever theocratic
tendencies appear. And I do not at all believe that all the ills of
Muslim
countries are due to Zionism and imperialism. But this is very far from
saying that Israel and the United States, and their intellectual
flacks,
have not played a combative, even incendiary role in stigmatizing and
heaping invidious abuse on an abstraction called "Islam," deliberately
in
order to stir up feelings of anger and fear about Islam among Americans
and
Europeans, who are also enjoined to see in Israel a secular, liberal
alternative. Miller says unctuously at the beginning of her book that
right-wing Judaism in Israel is "the subject of another book." It is
actually very much part of the book that she has written, except that
she
has willfully suppressed it in order to go after "Islam."

Writing about any other part of the world, Miller would be considered
woefully unqualified. She tells us that she has been involved with the
Middle East for twenty-five years, yet she has little knowledge of
either
Arabic or Persian. It would be impossible to be taken seriously as a
reporter or expert on Russia, France, Germany or Latin America, perhaps
even
China or Japan, without knowing the requisite languages, but for
"Islam,"
linguistic knowledge is unnecessary since what one is dealing with is
considered to be a psychological deformation, not a "real" culture or
religion.</p><p>

What of her political and historical information? Each of the ten
country
chapters (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan) begins with an anecdote and moves
immediately to a potted history that reflects not much more than the
work of
a name-dropping college sophomore. Cobbled up out of various, not
always
reliable authorities (her pages of footnotes are tainted by her
ignorance,
whether because she can only cite the sources she already knows she
wants in
English, or because she quotes only authorities whose views correspond
to
hers, thereby closing out an entire library by Muslims, Arabs and
non-Orientalist scholars), these histories are meant principally to
display
her command of the material, but actually expose her lamentable
prejudices
and failures of comprehension. In the Saudi Arabia chapter, for
instance,
she informs us in a note that her "favorite" source on the Prophet
Mohammed
is the French Orientalist Maxime Rodinson, a redoubtable Marxist
scholar
whose biography of the Prophet is written with a bracing combination of
anti-clerical irony and enormous erudition. What Miller gets from this
in
her short summary of Mohammed's life and ideas is that there is
something
inherently risible, if not contemptible, about the man whom Rodinson
says
was a combination of Charlemagne and Jesus Christ; for whereas Rodinson
understands what that means, Miller tells us (irrelevantly) that she is
not
convinced. For her, Mohammed is the begetter of an anti-Jewish
religion, one
laced with violence and paranoia. She does not directly quote one
Muslim
source on Mohammed; just imagine a book published in the United States
on
Jesus or Moses that makes no use of a single Christian or Judaic
authority.</p><p>

Most of Miller's book is made up not of argument and ideas but of
endless
interviews with what seems to be a slew of pathetic, unconvincing,
self-serving scoundrels and their occasional critics. Once past her
little
histories we are adrift in boring, unstructured meanderings. Here's a
typical sentence of insubstantial generalization: "And Syrians, mindful
of
their country's chaotic history" (of what country on earth is this not
also
true?) "found the prospect of a return to anarchy or yet another
prolonged,
bloody power struggle -- " (is this uniquely true of Syria as a
postcolonial
state, or is it true of a hundred others in Asia, Africa, Latin
America?)
"and perhaps even the triumph of militant Islam in the most secular"
(with
what thermometer did she get that reading?) "of all Arab states --
alarming." Leave aside the abominable diction and jaw-shattering jargon
of
the writing. What you have is not an idea at all but a series of
cliches mixed with unverifiable assertions that reflect the "thought"
of "Syrians" much less than they do Miller's.</p><p>

Miller gilds her paper-thin descriptions with the phrase "my friend,"
which
she uses to convince her reader that she really knows the people and
consequently what she is talking about. I counted 247 uses of the
phrase
before I stopped about halfway through the book. This technique
produces
extraordinary distortions in the form of long digressions that testify
to an
Islamic mindset, even as they obscure or ignore more or at least
equally
relevant material like local politics, the functioning of secular
institutions and the active intellectual contest taking place between
Islamists and nationalist opponents. She seems never to have heard of
Arkoun, or Jabri, or Tarabishi, or Adonis, or Hanafi or Djeit, whose
theses
are hotly debated all over the Islamic world.</p><p>

This appalling failure of analysis is especially true in the chapter on
Israel (mistitled, since it is all about Palestine), where she ignores
the
changes caused by the intifada and the prolonged effect of the
three-decade Israeli occupation, and conveys no sense of the
abominations
wrought on the lives of ordinary Palestinians by the Oslo accords and
Yasir
Arafat's one-man rule. Although Miller is obsessed with Hamas, she is
clearly unable to connect it with the sorry state of affairs in
territories
run brutally by Israel for all these years. She never mentions, for
instance, that the only Palestinian university not established with
Palestinian funds is Gaza's Islamic (Hamas) University, started by
Israel to
undermine the P.L.O. during the intifada. She records Mohammed's
depredations against the Jews but has little to say about Israeli
beliefs,
statements and laws against "non-Jews," often rabbinically sanctioned
practices of deportation, killing, house demolition, land confiscation,
annexation and what Sara Roy has called systematic economic
de-development.
If in her breathlessly excitable way Miller sprinkles around a few of
these
facts, nowhere does she accord them the weight and influence as causes
of
Islamist passion that they undoubtedly have.</p><p>

Maddeningly, she informs us of everyone's religion -- such and so is
Christian, or Muslim Sunni, Muslim Shiite, etc. Even so, she is not
always
accurate, managing to produce some howlers. She speaks of Hisham
Sharabi as
a friend but misidentifies him as a Christian; he is Sunni Muslim. Badr
el
Haj is described as Muslim whereas he is Maronite Christian. These
lapses
wouldn't be so bad were she not bent on revealing her intimacy with so
many
people. And then there is her bad faith in not identifying her own
religious
background or political predilections. Are we meant to assume that her
religion (which I don't think is Islam or Hinduism) is irrelevant?
<br>
She is embarrassingly forthcoming, however, about her reactions to
people
and power and certain events. She is "grief-stricken" when King Hussein
of
Jordan is diagnosed with cancer, although she scarcely seems to mind
that he
runs a police state whose many victims have been tortured, unfairly
imprisoned, done away with. One realizes of course that what counts
here is
her hobnobbing with the little King, but some accurate sense of the
"modern"
kingdom he rules would have been in order. Her eyes "filled with tears
-- of
rage" as she espies evidence of desecration of a Lebanese Christian
mosaic,
but she doesn't bother to mention other desecrations in Israel -- for
example, of Muslim graveyards -- and hundreds of exterminated villages
in
Syria, Lebanon, Palestine. Her real contempt and disdain come out in
passages like the following, in which she imputes thoughts and wishes
to a
middle-class Syrian woman whose daughter has just become an Islamist:
<br>
    "She would never have any of the things a middle-class Syrian
    mother
    yearned for: no grand wedding party and traditional white dress
    with
    diamond tiara for her daughter, no silver-framed photos of the
    happy
    wedding couple in tuxedo and bridal gown on the coffee table and
    fireplace mantel, no belly dancers wriggling on a stage and
    champagne
    that flowed till dawn. Perhaps Nadine's friends, too, had daughters
    or sons who had rejected them, who secretly despised them for the
    compromises they had made to win the favor of Assad's cruel and
    soulless regime. For if the daughter of such pillars of
    the Damascene bourgeoisie could succumb to the power of Islam,
    who was immune?"<br>

Such snide accounts trivialize and cheapen the people whose houses and
privacy she has invaded.</p><p>

Given her willingness to undercut even her friendly sources, the most
interesting question about Miller's book is why she wrote it at all.
Certainly not out of affection. Consider, for instance, that she admits
she
fears and dislikes Lebanon, hates Syria, laughs at Libya, dismisses
Sudan,
feels sorry for and a little alarmed by Egypt and is repulsed by Saudi
Arabia. She is relentlessly concerned only with the dangers of
organized
Islamic militancy, which I would hazard a guess accounts for less than
5
percent of the billion-strong Islamic world. She supports the violent
suppression of Islamists (but not torture and other "illegal means"
used in
that suppression; she misses the contradiction in her position), has no
qualms about the absence of democratic practices or legal procedures in
Palestine, Egypt or Jordan so long as Islamists are the target and, in
one
especially nauseating scene, she actually participates in the prison
interrogation of an alleged Muslim terrorist by Israeli policemen,
whose
systematic use of torture and other questionable procedures (undercover
assassinations, middle-of-the-night arrests, house demolitions) she
politely
overlooks as she gets to ask the handcuffed man a few questions of her
own.
</p><p>
Perhaps Miller's most consistent failing as a journalist is that she
only
makes connections and offers analyses of matters that suit her thesis
about
the militant, hateful quality of the Arab world. I have little quarrel
with
the general view that the Arab world is in a dreadful state, and have
said
so repeatedly for the past three decades. But she barely registers the
existence of a determined anti-Arab and anti-Islamic U.S. policy. She
plays
fast and loose with fact. Take Lebanon: She refers to Bashir Gemayel's
assassination in 1982 and gives the impression that he was elected by a
popular landslide. She does not even allude to the fact that he was
brought
to power while the Israeli army was in West Beirut, just before the
Sabra
and Shatila camp massacres, and that for years, according to Israeli
sources
like Uri Lubrani, Gemayel was the Mossad's man in Lebanon. That he was
a
self-proclaimed killer and a thug is also finessed, as is the fact that
Lebanon's current power structure is chock-full of people like Elie
Hobeika,
who was charged directly for the camp massacres. Miller cites instances
of
Arab anti-Semitism but doesn't even touch on the matter of Israeli
leaders
like Begin, Shamir, Eitan and, more recently, Ehud Barak (idolized by
Amy
Wilentz in The New Yorker) referring to Palestinians as two-legged
beasts, grasshoppers, cockroaches and mosquitoes. These leaders have
used
planes and tanks to treat Palestinians accordingly. As for the facts of
Israel's wars against civilians -- the protracted, consistent and
systematic
campaign against prisoners of war and refugee camp dwellers, the
village
destructions and bombings of hospitals and schools, the deliberate
creation
of hundreds of thousands of refugees -- all these are buried in reams
of
prattle. Miller disdains facts; she prefers quoting interminable talk
as a
way of turning Arabs into deserving victims of Israeli terror and U.S.
support of it. She perfectly exemplifies The New York Times's
current Middle East coverage, now at its lowest ebb.
</p><p>
In her lame conclusion Miller admits that her scolding may have been a
little too harsh. She then puts it all down to her "love" of the region
and
its people. I cannot honestly think of a thing that she loves: not the
conformism of Arab society she talks about, or the ostentatious
culinary
display she says that the Arabs confuse with hospitality, or the
languages
she hasn't learned, or the people she makes fun of or the history and
culture of a place that to her is one long tale of unintelligible sound
and
fury. She cannot enter into the life of the place, listen to its
conversations directly, read its novels and plays on her own (as
opposed to
making friends with their authors), enjoy the energy and refinements of
its
social life or see its landscapes. But this is the price of being a
Times reporter in an age of sullen "expertise" and instant
position-taking. You wouldn't know from Miller's book that there is any
inter-Arab conflict in interpretations and representations of the
Middle
East and Islam and that, given her choice of sources, she is deeply
partisan: an enemy of Arab nationalism, which she declares dead
numerous
times in the book; a supporter of U.S. policy; and a committed foe of
any
Palestinian nationalism that doesn't conform to the bantustans being
set up
according to the Oslo accords. Miller, in short, is a shallow,
opinionated
journalist whose gigantic book is too long for what it ends up saying,
and
far too short on reflection, considered analysis, structure and facts.
Poor
Muslims and Arabs who may have trusted her; they should have known
better
than to mistake an insinuated guest for a friend.
