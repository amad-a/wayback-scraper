By CPD member <b>Saad Yasin</b></center>

<p>
	Olive is a kind of trees that has a very small elliptical shaped
leaves with a color of dark creen. The branch usaully has countless 
number of
leaves.  The tree grow like a mushroom cloude, the leaves stays on the
branches through out the year's four seasons except for a few leaves that dry
out and fall down. the olive itself grows on the branches and depending on
the color of the olive and its size the tree in the seasons look like an old
man carrying a load that is much larger than his strength .  So a visit 
to an
olive garden in the month of late september and early october which is the
season for olive's colloction, sees a sight that take breath a way.  The 
trees
that where so independent and each has its own area and space a month a go,
they are touching and getting closer to each other today as to show 
support 
for each other and to compliment each other on the load each is carrying and
 a bout to deliver. the olive itself look like a grape  with varity of
color and sizes. They grow separate, i.e each olive is by itself as it
is declearing independance from other olives that are a djacent to it, 
but is 
not unusaul to see three or more olives sharing the same origin.  So this
breif introduction a bout the olive tree is just to give a reader who has
never seen an olive tree,and beleive me there are some, just a fogy 
discription 
because of the language limitation.  </p><p>
	Where ever you look in Palestine, and what ever you eat the olive is
there to remind us that we are here for you so be there for us.  Protect us,
take care of us and you never be disappointed.  Traviling on any road the
only thing that is green in the hot summer months are the olive trees, the
sight is so moving and touching that when ever you see the trees you just
can't look a way.  Olives and olive trees are a part of old generation and
the new one a like.  Any person that had planted an olive trees knows the 
reward
were so generouse, in my childhood days they where an olive trees
planting rush period which took the rest time that the villigers usaully 
have 
between seasons and made every body busy and excited. The rush was due to
planting more olive trees to make up for the one that had been destroyed or
damaged due to occupation or natural cuases.
</p><p>
	At the end of this month the harvest season for olive begins and 
last untile late october, early november.  The season start when the whole
community a gree that the olive is rib and at certain day we start the
harvest season.  So when the date set approached, it is like something great
is a bout to happen, something as great as a feast , something that make
every body full of anticipation and excitment.  So that early morning on 
that 
set date, the morning that was so quite up untile now, is so a live and the
movement of people and animals as well as the voices of the people calling
each other and talking, fills the breezy and fresh air of the morning.
</p><p>	The places that where empty and quite yesterday are full of people
and noise today.  The family that was fighting or arguing yesterday, they are
in harmony and happiness today.  The faces that seemed so sad and  worried
yesterday they are smilling and peaceful today.  The transformation of the
human can never be seen so evident except on those days.   The day start by
laying down a piece of clothes of plastic cover under the olive tree and the
small and older people climb on the top of the tree to seperate the olive
from the branch with minimum damage to the branch or the tree.  The tree in
palestinain cultur is a holy tree, it was mentioned in the Holy Quraan along
with the other holy tree, the Fig tree.  So people treat the tree as they
would treat small baby, with tender and care.  The other group stays under
the trees collocting what falls and store it in a bag.  From tree to tree
people and accessares move, and bag after bag get filled with olives.  People
a cross boundries that were  a reasons of a fight or an argument 
yesterday 
 are talking to each other today, sharing stories and offering helps and 
goods
 they just people who never suspect that they are not a part of an 
extended 
family.   The sellers who carry thier produce on a horse or a donkey, are
touring the land selling their produce for olives.  it is the only time of
the year that the old way of doing busniss which is called  mobadalah in
arabic, which means i give you orange you give a banana for the same 
value of
the orange.  That was old way and the new generation did not witness that we
born to see different pictures on a pieces of papers that you can take to a
shop and buy whatever needed.  So only at this time of the year and only with
olives, the seller will sell you Guava, Grape....etc. for olives.  Those
people who do that are usually people who are seller by trade or people who
have no olives or land and they just want to participate in this national
feast, and to make some olive for their families on the side.  By the end of
the day many filled bags that are realy heavy to carry or move a round ,are
standing under each tree so they can be collected and moved to storage place	
 </p><p>
	The routine goes on for the harvest season length and
every day of the season is just like a holiday.  The night life is also 
transformed so people visit each other, they talk about what else, the
olives.</p><p>
	The olive pressers open their doors so the processing to get the olive
oil is done there.  The front yard of the pressers building is full of people
and cars, and the villige which sleeps usualy by nine clock is twenty
four hours sleepless on those days.   The young people who never thought 
a bout
calories and getting fat, are drinking fresh olive oil that is just dripping
from the filteration system .  The aroma of the fresh olive oil fills the
air.  The people waiting their turns and having a fun time just
tasting olive oil every time a new person pressed his olives.   The noise of
the olive oil containers and the continouse  movement of the people all
night long is so fun to watch and be a part of.  </p><p>
	The taste of the fresh olive is in itself an inticer for more
food.  It works out the appitites and gives a feeling of hunger, a bread 
soaked with oil is more deliciouce, than a roasted lamb .</p><p>
	The olive trees plays a decoration rule,people use them to
decorate new houses and weddings parties.  They also play an important rule
in providing the shadow on hot summer days, and provider of wood for the cold
winter nights.  The history of the land of palestine is written on every
olive leave, telling the past, the present, and the future.  In every country
there is something that is a symbol of the people and the land, in palestine
olive trees are the  symbol, they are people's pride, and history.</p><p> 
	During the years of intifada, and even before, the israel's army took
out many trees for the reason of hidding stone throwers.  The trees they took
are thousand of years old, they are called roman trees.  By taking them they
knew what they were doing, they knew they are trying to wipe out the history,
the protection, and pride.</p><p>
	These days people are back to planting more olive trees, even though
it takes very long for an olive tree to mature, it needs a lot of caring and
hard work, but the rewards can't be measured by any scale.  From my 
personal 
experience none of the olive oils that have been sold in U.S.A have the
smell or the taste of palestine olive oil.  
  	 </p><p>
	The olive trees has played a big part in palestine
culture.  The undecleared holidays that olive season bring with it, the oil
and olives which fell the empty shelfs of every palestinain home, the sight
and beauty the olive trees provide are valuable assists and palestine is
blessed to have olive trees on evey hill,mountain and vally. The rule the 
olive trees played in palesinain struggle for freedom can all be found
in the struggle history from 1936 when Alqasam fought the british army in 
olive gardens in a small town near Jenin called Yaabad, the olive trees 
provided a cover to few palestinain soilders who were facing a large 
british 
army is still talked about in every gathering, the eyewitness account of 
how 
the body of Shaheed Al-qasam laying down between branches of olive trees as
if they were hugging him good by is still vivid in our minds. In 1987 
uprising 
the olive trees played an important rule in protecting the young intifada 
soilders. Long before when reading the history of palestine and people 
who 
lived there, the olive trees were a part of their culture also, which can
be seen in there arts and  drawing .<br>
