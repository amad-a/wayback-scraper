<title>Nizar Qabbaani: When will they announce the death of the 
arabs?</title>
</head><body>
<center><h2>Mata yu3linuuna wafaata l 3arab? (Nizar Qabbaani)</h2></center>
Sorry to our non-Arabic readers. This is in Arabic and only in graphic 
format.
I did take the liberty and delete a few sections. The poem is, I think, 
translated
into English. As mentioned at the end of the poem, it was first retrieved 
from
a site by Prof Nicholas Heer. You can find the original at:
<a href="/weber.u.washington.edu/~heer/" style="pointer-events: none;">http://weber.u.washington.edu/~heer/</a>
which is also very useful for Arabic computing resources. There were only two
minor typos that were corrected below. Remember, if you have images 
turned off, you
won't see anything below.<hr>
