<center><h1>Happy? (New) Year!</h1></center> 
There are three hours left in the life of 1996 according to my 
current time zone. It's rainy and windy outside and whether the 
power will stay on until I finish or not is a question that bears 
similarity to our cause.<p>
 I am not planning on watching fireworks, attending celebrations or even
bothering to switch on the TV (that is the first part of slavery one can 
afford to free themselves from peacefully - unless it becomes a tool for 
the masses, which I can't see happening soon). Since I am not watching, I 
ask myself the simple and obvious question: Will 1997 be different as far 
as the Palestinians are concerned? </p><p>
One should not start by being pessimistic. At the same time, we must be 
realistic and rely on cautious optimism. So, what is cautious optimism?
Some define it as looking for the good while being prepared for the worst.
<br>I prefer to look at it as being able to expect what ... if ... . <br>
We, Palestinians have seen so much hardship at the hands of both friends and 
foes. We are still targeted everywhere and on different levels. Our real 
friendship is with individuals who saw the light on their own and while
we deeply appreciate such noble feelings and thank these fellows from 
the depth of our heart, we can't count on it while we struggle with a 
nasty mess of problems.</p><p>
Yes, difficulties are so severe to the point that on an individual level
we may dispair, give up, compromise or join the "why should I care" line.
<br>The ugly fact is: one may run but one can't escape. Not only that, 
but a reasonable share of the total blame falls squarely on us. Sure there 
are plans and plots, but these work only with a responsive target and we 
can choose not to be. We blame others or expect them to perfect their job 
while we don't contribute to the overall effort if not sit down and assign 
labels to the rest. This is the right environment for the growth of 
unqualified community leaders, opportunists and corruption. If I care less
then I become a passive target: I fail to speak out (in a civilized way) 
and those in higher positions only hear praise. This generates a "feedback"
and things get worse.</p><p>
The resulting effect may not become evident very soon, but it is already 
being felt, and badly, in Palestine - let alone the Diaspora. Oslo was 
imposed on us with all its ills and we are reaping what was planted. The 
question is: can we minimize the hardship? Will someone really take pity 
on us and solve our problems?</p><p>
The brief answer to the first part is yes, to the second? a big NO. This 
is the time of corporate governments and ethnic cleansing (also known as 
the new world order). If you belong to the right race, bright color and 
you are "worth" something on the material scale, you have chances to 
survive, otherwise, you better write your will before it is too late.
We can't hide our identity (we shouldn't in the first place) and our 
resources are controlled by other managers, so our chances are pretty slim.
</p><p>
Now let us come back to the glimmer of hope: We can minimize the suffering 
if we focus on it and coordinate our efforts. We have to identify the 
challenges - not a rocket engineering issue - and work toward a better 
present and future. The magic words here are very few, yet very effecient:
<br>Awareness, networking, coordination of sincere, civilized efforts, 
dedication and self-denial. This last one is a bit difficult.<br>
This has to take place in both physical and cyber space. We are trying to 
offer a starting point by providing free seating and digital coffee in 
the Cafe hoping to bring serious people together and match needs with 
skills. What we can't do is provide the will to make a difference and we 
hope serious people already have it, no doubt. Why not get started right 
away?<br>
This is getting too long and the lights are still threatening to say goodbye
so let's end with a humble wish list for 1997:</p><ul>
<li> To see more people with awareness who do care
</li><li> To see joint efforts between various groups/organizations/establishnments
and individuals toward the commom goals
</li><li> To see more digital awareness material on the internet
</li><li> To see the release of our prisoners (men and women) from Israeli 
jails and to free our political prisoners in national jails
</li><li> To live in a place we can really call home: security, dignity, respect
for human rights, sovereignty and economic prosperity with control over 
our resources rather than extending hands for conditional donations
</li><li> To see occupation forces and settlers leave, Palestinians from Diaspora
return (especially stranded Palestinians in no man's land)
</li><li> Your wish goes here - still lots left (like sealing that tunnel under 
Al-AQSa, does anybody still remember it?)
</li><li> Cafe maintainer's special: to get a reply to e-mail messages sent to 
a major newspaper in Palestine, get two of our digital microphones back 
(they went on interview assignments and got stuck!), to see more digital 
contribution from fellow Palestinians and friends and best of all, to get 
a reasonable job back home as soon as possible so upcoming issues may be 
edited from Palestine. 
</li></ul>
Happy New Year!<p>
