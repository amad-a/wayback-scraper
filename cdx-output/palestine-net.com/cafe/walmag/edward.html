<body><h2>Edward Said on Arab Powerlessness</h2>
Edward Said argues that the Arabs' problem is not solely the wickedness of
a
percieved oppressor, but a deep-seated and paralysing internal malaise.

The problem is Arab powerlessness.<br>

THE question is not only that Israel has lived outside the norms of
international behaviour in war or in peace since it was established, but
that today the Arabs are totally powerless.  Whereas Israel can roll its
tanks across borders, its airforce can bomb civilians at will, its
propagandists can fill the western media with their lies about
self-defence
and the war against terrorism, the Arabs for their part can only bleat out
little squeaks of anger.</p><p>

There are small groups here land there (like Hizbullah) who can offer
Israel
resistance with outmoded Katyushas, but they are part of no alliance or
plan
that is larger than them.  Lebanon has now been bombed mercilessly for
almost two weeks (and Hizbullah has survived), yet no Arab capital has
brought forth any official response except silence or polite diplomatic
murmurings.<br>
The problem is Arab powerlessness.  This bears repeating: the problem is
Arab powerlessness.  This is something for which neither the United States
-
which has behaved as an extension of the Israeli government, and the
lamentable Warren Christopher as its local office boy - nor France, nor
the
European Union has a solution.  It is an Arab problem.  And it concerns
every individual who calls him/herself an Arab.  We are all part of this
general incapacity to do much, except look on wringing our hands, crying
or
going on strike. </p><p> 

The most recent solution to our problem has been the so called peace
process, which any mentally competent observer of Israel could have
figured
out an extension of its longstanding policy to dominate the Arabs
militarily
and economically.  For Israel, Arabs are racially inferior people who must
be beaten or punished until they obey.  When they don't, as in the
Hizbullah
instance, the Israelis are momentarily stopped, though their arrogance
continues.  Then come the sudden illumination on the part of great minds
like Mahmoud Abbas and Yassir Arafat that Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin
had
undergone a change.  They have become visionary men of peace.  So leading
an
exhausted and disillusioned Palestinian people Abu Ammar (arafat) and Abu
Mazen leaped into Israel's lap.  </p><p>

All you have to do to know what then happened is to visit the Occupied
Territories, which I have just done.  Then you can see that the peace
means
Israeli occupation with Palestinian partners.  The Palestine authority now
has 12,000 Palestinian prisoners, thus proving that a Palestinian enforcer
of Israeli policies can as clever as an Israeli in catching Palestinian
"terrorists" and "fundamentalists". The only trouble is that the military
occupation continues, the Territories are closed, Area A is only 1 per
cent
of the West Bank, there is 70 per cent unemployment, Palestinian lands are
expropriated every day, houses are demolished, people go hungry and they
are
tortured, but Arafat goes to meet Peres while the Israeli army is bombing
Lebanon and killing civilians.  The two great peace makers and Nobel-prize
winners emerge from their meetings with smiles on their faces. The peace
process  moves forward, and allows Peres to invade Lebanon, thus placing
his
desire to be re-elected above the lives of half a million Lebanese
refugees and several hundred fatalities.</p><p>
	
Such powerlessness borders on the comic. Of the 10 countries which lead
the
world in arms purchases, seven are Arab. Every Arab citizen has seen the
armies and the police forces (Arafat has no fewer than 13 of his own)
everywhere on streets and street corners.  None of these, no airforce or
navy (Arafat has 60 naval officers stationed in Nablus, which is 150
kilometres from any sea) or army, is used to deter Israel, except Syria's,
althoug it too will not fight back in Lebanon where it has 30,000 troops.
</p><p>

The real question is powerlessness.  As VS Naipaul, the
Trinidadian-British
writer, has his main character say in his first novel, The MI-Mic Men: "We
in the Third World lack order.  Above all, we lack power, and we do not
understand that we lack power.  We mistake words and the acclamation of
words for power; as soon as our bluff is called we are lost." it is
certainly true that, alone of the Arab states, Syria has stuck to its
principles about complete withdrawal, but it does not mitigate the fact
that
like all other Arab states Syria has no real civil society, or democracy,
or
social dynamism; its Policies in Lebanon do not provoke admiration or
participation on the part of most Lebanese, who feel themselves -rightly
so-
powerless in Syria's orbit.	</p><p>

AS a society we are left with slogans and, as Naipaul's character says,
words.  And these continue to camouflage the reality from us, which is our
own self-inflicted powerlessness. We must all of us ask why it is that for
the past five decades we have watched Israel violate our sovereignty,
massacre our civilians, humiliate our soldiers and generals, colonise our
land, even as we make speeches and vow vengeance. Empty words in the air.
	</p><p>
Our last gamble - that Israel wants peace and is willing to be generous -
has proved to be extremely flawed. Israel, like the US wants to preserve
its
interests intact. No matter how many times Abu Ammar and Abu Mazen repeat
the words "peace process", the facts are that their people lose more land
(and sovereignty) everyday, and Jerusalem is more lost to the Palestinians
every day.  When a "crisis" occurs, all the Arab peace-makers act
surprised,
as if they had no idea that Israel would behave this way, although of
course
it has always behaved this way, and will continue to do so, because it has
power and we do not.  Power, after all, is not just military strength.  It
is the social power that comes from democracy, the cultural power that
comes
from freedom of expression and research, the personal power that entitles
every Arab citizen to feel  that he or she is in fact a citizen, and not
just a sheep in some great shepherd's flock.</p><p>

I often think that one reason for our powerlessness is that we feel
self-hatred.  Otherwise it is impossible to explain how over 200 million
people with human and natural resources of a high order can continuously
hurt themselves, continuously prevent themselves from accumulating the
kind
of power that brings self-respect and seriousness of purpose.  I have no
other explanation for our situation, which cannot be extenuated or
explained
away by appeals to the ravages of imperialism, or to corrupt regimes, or
any
of the other litanies of self-exculpation.<br>
