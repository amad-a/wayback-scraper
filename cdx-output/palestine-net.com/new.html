<li> <a href="/alburaq.net/" style="pointer-events: none;">Al-Buraq</a> is a new site from PalTel. It has an online phonebook among other services.
</li>
<li> <a href="/palestine-net.com/ads/" style="">Palestine-Net's Classified Ads</a> - browse ads or submit yours, but make sure you read the introduction first.</li>
<li> <a href="/palestine-net.com/education/it.html" style="">Palestine-Net's IT and Education Initiative</a> - just started, to raise awareness and provide resources for students and educators.</li>
<li> The current situation in Palestine: you can follow up current events from our <a href="/palestine-net.com/news/" style="">news links</a>.

<li> Life in Palestine: <a href="/palestine-net.com/life/ccc.html" style="">Interview with Mr. Hisham Zarour</a> (manager of Carma Cyber Club - Internet Cafe' in Ramallah)
</li>
<li> New sites added:<br>
Although this was not a comprehensive update, but most sites which were submitted to us via the right channel were added. Meet Palestine Chronicle and JQF in our news section.</li>
<li> December 19, 1999:<br>
* A few more sites were added. Please help us by submitting completed sites only (no under construction, no multiple submissions, please). <br>
* Did you leave Palestine after January 1st, 1984? If you did and can't return now, you may want to check with PA or representative offices in your area. Please don't contact Palestine-Net regarding this issue. All we know of is a joint meeting between PA and Israeli sides discussing these cases on an individual basis and that PA asked those affected to fill forms.</li>
<li> November 26: Palestine-Net's camera was in Jerusalem (AL-Quds) and we have pictures (available/coming) in our <a href="/palestine-net.com/life/" style="">Life in Palestine</a> section.</li>

* new sites added: a number of sites have been added to our Palestine Web Index. Sites were added under government, culture, news, directories, misc. and iCafe's.<br>
* We are communicating with Radio Palestine to re-broadcast a daily news summary from Palestine (see under news). This is getting difficult and the two test files may be the last ones you'll hear. We are sorry about this but we can't use their material w/out approval.<br>
* new interviews: we usually rely on promises from people to talk to us or answer our questions. Sometimes, things do not work as we like them to ... we keep trying and sometimes we succeed :-)<br>
* The Qusin oil press articles (under life in Palestine): a very dear visitor has asked for a translation of that article into English. Can we count on one of our visitors to e-mail us the translation? Your efforts will be acknowledged.

    <li><strong>New sites</strong>: we are updating <strong>Palestine
        Around The Web</strong>. Some links are being moved to
        new sections and many others are being added. Currently,
        we are updating <a href="/palestine-net.com/education/" style="">Education

    <li><strong>Local </strong><a href="/palestine-net.com/media/" style=""><strong>sound
        clips</strong> </a>have been converted to the real audio
        format. This takes around one tenth of the .au file size
        and hence takes much less to download and play. If you
        don't have a real audio player, you can download a free
        copy from www.real.com We also added nine more clips
        including Ishhad ya 3aalam and the full national anthem (see
        clips 12-20).</li>
    <li><strong>New design </strong>for the main page - the image
        map is being replaced by text. The "table of
        contents" page is now redundant.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope you enjoy your visit! Happy surfing!</p>
