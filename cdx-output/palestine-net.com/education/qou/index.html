<li>The <b>QOU</b> project was initiated in 1975 in response to the needs
of the Palestinian people for higher education in the present, severe,
social, cultural and economic conditions in which they lived under Israeli
Occupation or in the diaspora.</li>

<li>The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), approached UNESCO to prepare
a feasibility study for the University project in cooperation with the
Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD). By 1980 the study
was completed and the UNESCO General Conference passed a resolution calling
member states to cooperate in implementing the project.</li>

<li>In 1981 the Palestine National Council (PNC) approved the project of
the University but, owning to various circumstances, the project did not
materialize until 1985, the date of <b>QOU</b> inauguration, when it started
operating from its temporary HQ in Amman.</li>

<li>In the second half of 1990, <b>QOU</b> started providing its services
to Palestinian students in the Occupied Territories through first-established
branch in Al-Quds al-Sharif (Jerusalem), with the intention of extending
future activities to Palestinians in the diaspora and later to students
from other Arab countries.</li>

<p>As a national institution for higher education, training and research,
<b>QOU</b> philosophy stems from belief in and commitment to playing a
role in the education of Arab individuals and the development of Arab community
in Palestine and more generally in the Arab World. In the light of this
philosophy, the University attempts to attain the following objectives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide opportunities and facilities for higher education and advanced
training in various fields of study, including science and technology,
thus meeting the needs of the largest possible number of Palestinians and
other Arabs, who otherwise would be deprived of higher education.</li>

<li>Develop students' characters and prepare them for a useful role in
the community through encouraging cooperation and training on self-employment
projects.</li>

<li>Provide Continuous Education and professional preparation in various
applied studies to enable students to play a constructive role in their
communities.</li>

<li>Support local pre-university and university education, as well as training
systems, through the production of high quality instructional, printed,
audio-visual, and computer-oriented materials and encourage research.</li>

<li>Initiate and develop public-oriented modes of education appropriate
for the exceptional and unexpected future conditions.</li>

<li>Conduct basic and applied research directed to the service of the Arabs,
particularly the Palestinian community.</li>

Education System</font></b></p>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<p>Distance Education is, in essence, taking education to place of work
or residence of interested students instead of attendance in an educational
institution. In this way students can combine study and work, adjust the
program of study they choose and can, as a result, study at their own pace
in a way suitable to their personal circumstances. The underlying aim is,
of course, to make better use of human effort and energy and increase productivity.</p>

<p>Distance Education is, by definition, based on self-learning and learner's
autonomy, utilizing printed and audio-visual media made available by recent
massive progress in instructional communication and information technologies.</p>

<ul>
<li>Distance Education is, by its very nature and by the nature of its
media, capable of cutting across regional and geographical barriers. It
can overcome social and economic differences to reach students pursuing
higher education and consequently can offer services to unlimited numbers
of such learners.</li>

<li>In the light of worldwide experience, distance education is one of
the most successful means of quantitative and qualitative means of higher
education, as it provides higher education opportunities and training for
the largest possible number of students from different socio-economic sectors
of the community. The democratization of higher education is thereby achieved.
Indeed, distance education has been effectively adopted worldwide in countries
so diverse in political and social systems as Australia, Indonesia, Pakistan,
Britain, Thailand, China, Canada, India, Holland, Japan and the Commonwealth
of Independent Countries (formerly the USSR).</li>

<p><b>QOU</b> has adopted distance education in order to:</p>

<ul>
<li>contribute to solving problems arising from the inability of conventional
universities to meet the massive increase in the numbers of students who
are qualified for and interested in higher education.</li>

<li>train students in self-learning mechanisms and enhance their intellectual
abilities and critical thinking.</li>

<li>broaden the scope of graduates' expectations and their interest in
job opportunities and their interest in job opportunities beyond clerical
work. Through providing students with knowledge and skills, the means of
self-reliance, and the ability to establish and manage individual and joint
projects, it is hoped to improve their prospects.</li>

<li>provide opportunities for <b>QOU</b> faculty and students to conduct
research.</li>

<li>Provide study programs that meet the needs of the Palestinian people
and the Arab World and support their development plans.</li>

<li>support the steadfastness of Palestinian people under occupation and
reduce the number of Palestinian youth seeking higher education by going
abroad.</li>

<li>secure greater student interaction by providing opportunities of student-student
and student-faculty meetings in the established centers, through seminars,
summer courses, continuous evaluation and exchange of ideas between the
university and its students.</li>

Handbook prepared by the University itself. The handbook includes internationally
recognized patterns of material preparation and development, characteristic
of distance education, such as presentation, student participation, guided
dialogue and student-centered techniques. Indeed, teaching materials are
prepared and evaluated by a selected group of highly qualified and experienced
educators. Layout is supervised by the University designers and technical
staff who pay special attention to format, style, language accuracy and
production guided by professional standards.</p>

<p><b>QOU </b>Headquarter was first established in Amman, Jordan, as a
temporary base form which the University can operate and serve the net
work of study centers established in the Occupied Territories. The University
could serve wider Arab needs for higher education and have its core academic
and professional staff assisted by panels of experts from local Universities
in Amman and distance education institutions overseas, prepare and design
self-instructional materials and multi media distance education learning
materials for students enrolled in <b>QOU.</b></p>

<p>Following these intensive efforts and extensive preparations, the <b>QOU</b>
was opened in Jerusalem in the second half of 1991. In the wake of the
latest political development it was decided to move the <b>QOU</b> headquarters
to Jerusalem, with its present office in Amman functioning as a liaison
office coordinating all educational matters with the new HQ in JERUSALEM.
At present the <b>QOU</b> covers seven educational regions in al-Quds (Jersualem),
Nablus, Ramallah, Bethlehem, Al-Khalil (Hebron), Gaza and Jericho respectively
and two study centers in Tolkarm and Jenin.</p>
