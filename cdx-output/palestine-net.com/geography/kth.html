<h1>Palestinian Cities, Towns and Villages<br>Know Thy Homeland! - YOU 
can help .... Read On ...</h1>
<hr>
<b>Update (March, 25, 1997)</b>: You may be wondering about the status of
this project. The answer is some, but not much progress. Recently we heard 
from one person who wanted to write about Yaffaa and we had two 
requests to write about villages (one is ready!). Although we wanted 
to get done with towns first, we did not expect this level of apathy.
 We are accepting entries about villages (small, large, destroyed and
 still standing). The list below (scroll down) is followed by towns/
villages under promised construction (including those which are ready (those with active link)
<hr><br> 
Welcome to this newly forming, yet very important,
corner.<br> In brief, this is a modest project that aims at compiling an 
<b>electronic desk reference
of Palestinian cities, towns and villages</b>. Doing the work is a matter 
of belonging and/or an expression of pride in your identity. It is 
understood that not everyone grew up in their hometown and some never 
visited, yet they want to learn more. Whether you know about your 
hometown or not, <b>YOU</b> can still help others to help both you and 
many others. The least you can do is encourage others to participate even 
if it takes rewarding them or assisting at some phase (scan a picture, 
type those manuscripts or sponsor a student who can do a good job 
documenting a few cities).<br> <b>How does it work? 
How can I help?</b><br> This project is divided into two phases:<br>
First, we want to document the cities and towns whose names are below 
(hope none is missing).<br>
Once this is over, or reasonably advanced, we'll take the second step and 
do the same for villages
and the rest of population centers.<br>
What is needed is the following (at least):
<ul>
<li>Location, land and topography
</li><li> Historical background
</li><li>Population (current stats) and economy
</li><li>Education, health and recreation etc
</li><li> Land marks, tourist attractions, heritage, religious sites, industry 
special and others
</li><li>Optional: if possible, and where appropriate, pictures that are both 
clear and fast loading (30 - 40 Kb and nothing more)
</li><li> References used: old books will be good for historical background, 
new ones or direct sources for current updates are equally important. 
Also, don't forget to include your name, e-mail and homepage (unless you 
prefer to stay anonymous)</li></ul>
To be part of this honor, please send e-mail indicating which city(ies)/ 
town(s) you want to work on. If more than one want to work on the same 
town, we can put you in touch to get to know each other and exchange info 
to compile a better entry. We are looking for 1000 - 2000 words per town. 
Two 
lines is not good and a thesis is too much. So, please pick your choice 
from the list below and go
to the mailbox: enter your <b>full</b> e-mail address (if your username 
is xyz123 and you are with AOL, your e-mail address is 
<i>xyz123@aol.com</i> and anything else is wrong, no one can e-mail you 
if you say <i>xyz123</i> only). Please enter KTH (for know thy homeland) 
in the subject and indicate when you expect to finish the work.<br>
<i>Example:<br>
Name: so and so<br>
E-mail: abc@example.com<br>
subject: KTH<br>
Message: I'd like to help with the KTH project. I picked ....... (town) 
and I hope to be done by
........ (date). If something goes wrong, I'll let you know.</i>
