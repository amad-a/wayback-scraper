<center><b>Towards A Better Understanding of Islam</b></center>

	<p>Islam, the faith and (presumably) way of life of over a billion
Muslims all over the globe, is still misunderstood and mis-represented.
This is hard to digest at a time when the media is so powerful in reaching
almost any spot on this miserable planet. It is ironic to see starving kids
(in the unfortunate world) wearing Micky Mouse T-shirts (which never relieve
hunger), and to learn that a great faith and way of life which re-shaped
history, is still unknown or ill-known by both its followers and outsiders
(general spectators and critics alike). What's going on here? Conspiracy?
Crusades? Other scapegoats?</p><p>

	These are the easy answers that we, muslims, barricade ourselves 
behind to justify our poor performance. I'm not overlooking the other 
factors, neither the fact that despite all of this, Islam still appeals to
a large and rapidly growing crowd all over the globe. But it hutrs to learn
that a single person turns away because of "bad muslim examples" - whether
intentional or not - or due to poisonous lies in the guise of "Islamic 
facts" in the media (cyberspace included).</p><p>

	The problem arises mainly from an overlooked basic fact:That Muslims
themselves studied very little about Islam. We sometimes mix Islam with 
tradition or take it for granted without thinking (a basic Islamic 
ingredient). This dilemma gets amplified when Muslims travel to other 
countries without a sizable Muslim population. Here, the law of "mass action
" no longer applies, and we become responsible for 'teaching' others. There
is nothing wrong in travelling abroad for studies or work. After all, Islam
entered a number of countries when Muslim merchants set good examples there.
The flux of knowledge-seeking people was the other way round before.
</p><p>
	Upon facing a new challenging environment - where the locals know
nothing about us (if not stereotypes), we are faced with a 9.5 culturequake
with everlasting after shocks. Armed with very little (if only true!) to 
say about Islam, and due to the lack of presentation skills (language and
environment-specific methodology), we end up saying something completely
different from what we mean, or we imply it by the way we behave. The locals
rarely appreciate the above limitations and both of us lose.
</p><p>
	What is even worse, is when we end up classifying the local society
as evil, enemies of God, or a bona fide real estate in Hell - only because
neither of us understands the other. A consequence of this is either a state
of complete seperation, isolation and apprehension leading to a ghetto-like
"we" and "they", or even worse when a new comer dissolves and loses both
his/her identity and the respect of others.
</p><p>
	How about making a committment to dedicate a five-minute effort to
add to our knowledge on a daily basis? Let's bear in mind that making the 
Islamic knowledge and awareness in everyone's reach is a duty, but forcing
it down the throat of anyone (by whatever means) is a sin: "Let there be no
compulsion in Diin, for truth is easily distinguished from falsehood." [the
rough meaning of Qur'an 2:256].
