<b>Wanted: Palestinian Coins from British Mandate</b><br>
I am interested in purchasing coins from the British Mandate period in Palestine. I purchased one while I was in Jerusalem about a year ago and was delighted to find coins with "Palestine" minted on them! It would do my heart good to have more to show people that Palestine has existed for a long time.
