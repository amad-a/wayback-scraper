<bold><center>WATER CONSERVATION TECHNIQUES- (GUIDELINES FOR CONSUMERS)</center>
</bold>
Jerusalem Water Undertaking is a member of the National Public Awareness Campaign Network which consists of a number of Municipalities, Governmental and non-Governmental Agencies, and Water Utilities in Palestine. The main objective of this Network is to make the public a ware of the general water situation and the Palestinian water rights, and how to deal with rationing water usage.


<title>JWU - Public Awareness
</title>

<p>
<b>The following rationing tips will be distributed by the Undertaking
to the consumers in the region:   </b>

</p><ul>
<li>Inspect the plumbing system for leaks
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Install flow control devices in showers
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Turn off all water during vacations or long periods of absence
</li><li>Insulate hot water pipes to avoid having to clear the "hot"
line of cold water during use.
</li><li>Check all faucets, inside and out, for drips.  Make repairs
promptly.
</li><li>Reduce volume of water in toilet flush tank with a quart plastic
bottle filled with water.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Never use the toilet as a trash basket for facial tissues,
etc.  Each flush uses 10-12 liters  of water.  Items carelessly
thrown in could clog the sewage disposal system.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Accumulate a full laundry load before washing, or use a lower
water level setting.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Take showers instead of baths.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Bottle and refrigerate water to avoid running excess water
from the lines to get cold water for meals.  Shake bottle before
serving to incorporate air in the water so that it does not taste
flat.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>To get warm water, turn hot water on first; then add cold
water as needed.  This is quicker and saves water.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>When washing dishes by hand, use one pan of soapy water for
washing and a second one of hot water for rinsing.  Rinsing in
a pan requires less water than rinsing under running faucet.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Vegetables requiring more water should be grouped together
in the garden to make maximum use of water applications.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Mulch shrubs and other plants to retain moisture in the soil
longer.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Spread leaves, clippings or plastic around the plants.  Mulching
also controls weeds that compete with garden plants for water.
 Mulches should permit water to soak into the soil.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Consider drip irrigation systems in outdoor gardens.  These
methods use 25 to 50 percent less water than hose or sprinkler
methods.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li> When building or remodeling, consider:
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Installing smaller than standard bath tubs to save water.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Locating water heater near area where hottest water is needed
- usually in the kitchen/laundry area.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Installing a dual wastewater system (i.e., gray water separated
from sewage water
</li></ul>
