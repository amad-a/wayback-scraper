<p>
One of the most valuable assets an organization can have, is its
employees. Jerusalem Water Undertaking being an autonomous service
organization, relies very heavily on its employees to provide
the most efficient, most professional and most pleasant service.
Since its establishment in 1965, JWU experienced all kinds of
changes and was effected by a war and occupation. Through it all,
the employees of JWU steadfastly strive to do the excellent job
that they only know how to do. 
</p><p>
JWU credits its success to these men and women, and with their
continued efforts, dedication and determination will continue
to provide the best possible service to the consumers and community.
</p><p>
Additionally, JWU is very grateful to the National and International
organizations  that contributed to the development of JWU and
helped by funding numerous  projects and studies. It was JWU's
excellent international reputation that convinced these organizations
to fund the projects and involve JWU in many water related studies.

</p><p>
Jerusalem Water Undertaking recognizes with great respect and
admiration the efforts and sacrifice of its employees that lost
their lives while performing their duties.
</p><p>
Last and Foremost, JWU is thankful to its consumers for their
loyalty, cooperation and patronage and takes it upon itself to
continue providing the best service possible.
