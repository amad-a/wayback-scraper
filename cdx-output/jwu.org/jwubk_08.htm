<center><h2><i>WATER METERS</i></h2></center>

JWU used a variety of 1/2 inch water meter types in the past years ( such as ROLEX, POLEX, SOLONGEN, ANDRIA, PHL, ANISBACH, RAUTER and others), which depend on the water velocity to measure the flow.   

KENT volumetric water meters are in use at JWU since 1966. They have a great degree of accuracy and ease of maintenance with possibilities of direct reading by the consumers. Also, locally produced [1 and 16] inch meters in diameter were used to facilitate maintenance and avoid difficulties of import from abroad.

Presently, the Undertaking has about 24000 KENT water meters in
use, and about 300 Israeli made and other types of meters. KENT
water meters are made and imported from the United Kingdom. The
meters have proved to be the best and have many technical advantages
over the other types. KENT meters have the volumetric Rotary-Piston
principle of measurement ensuring a remarkable accuracy of registration
even at the very lowest rates of flow. The water flowing through
the meter, drives the circular piston in an eccentric path around
an accurately machined thermoplastic measuring or working chamber,
each revolution representing the transfer of a known quantity
of water. The rotary action of the piston is transferred to a
dog drive coupling from which it is transmitted to the combined
reduction gear and counter unit. The combined counter and gear
unit is fully sealed, vacuum filled, with a simple straight-reading
presentation.

When KENT meters were compared with other in-use meters, they
were found to be more accurate and have a longer lifetime in addition
to being easy to dismantle and maintain. KENT Meters have a unique
advantage over other meters, they can be mounted either vertically
or horizontally with the same efficiency and accuracy.
