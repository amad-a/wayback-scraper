<h2><center><i>EFFICIENCY IN THE UNDERTAKING
</i></center></h2>
In keeping up with its reputation as the most efficient Water Authority in the West Bank and Gaza, JWU continuously strives to improve its performance in all areas. The quality of a water service is measured not only by its effectiveness in providing a continuous, clean water supply to the consumer, but also by its efficiency in producing the water at minimum cost and providing it at reasonable prices. The determination of the real cost of water is a matter that involves the evaluation of every phase and aspect in the water supply and distribution system in search for least cost solutions. However, first the costs themselves must be studied in order to determine the major cost items so as to gain insight and determine the areas that should be given the most consideration and which will have the greatest effect on reducing the overall costs. JWU was one of five water utilities in the eastern Mediterranean region chosen by an international organization to participate in a water cost study. Two more studies dealing with cost recovery and affordability are underway in the Undertaking.

<b><a name="_Toc342547251">EFFICIENCY MEASURES</a></b>
</p><p>
To provide additional insight into the nature and characteristics
of the operation at JWU, efficiency measures have been calculated
which provide some additional data to support and complement the
cost analysis.
</p><p>
The efficiency measures used, include a number of indicators related
to water consumption, the water distribution system, personnel
and unaccounted-for water (UFW). The values for these indicators
were calculated for the five years in which costs were evaluated
(1990 - 1994) and will be used in the cost analysis.
</p><p>
It should be noted that in all indicators that use the population
served as a basis of calculation, the population is divided into
two parts. The local population includes all normal (single) users
and the population of the two local municipalities, Beitunia and
Bir Zeit, who purchase in bulk. The remaining population served,
which includes the inhabitants of the six Israeli settlements
in the area and the official and military camps are estimated
at 10,000 inhabitants.
</p><p>
The indicators address various areas of operation and performance
at JWU including Water Consumption, Water Distribution, Personnel,
UFW and others. A review of the values provides some indication
on the nature of the JWU operation. In general, no significant
changes for the better or for the worse are indicated during the
past four years by these indicators. However, some general observations
can be made from these indicators:

<li>Net water consumption in the area, at about 90 liters per
capita/ day, is relatively low in comparison with published values
from other countries. The net usage per connection, 22 m<sup>3</sup>/connection/month,
is still low but does not display such a high gap from the values
of other countries due to the relatively large average family
size in the area (over 6 individuals/ connection).

<ul>
<li>The per capita consumption of people in the two municipalities
(Beitunia and Bir Zeit) who purchase water in bulk is much higher
than that of the remaining local populations. Their consumption
is estimated at over 100 liters/capita/day, while that of the
remaining local populations is about 90 liters/capita/day. The
reason for this is most likely that the consumption of the municipalities
includes the losses in the local distribution network and is also
due to the consumption of Beir Zeit University.
</li><li>Although no data is available regarding the number of inhabitants
of the Israeli settlements, a conservative estimate of a total
of 9,000 individuals plus Israeli Security Forces living in army
camps would indicate a daily per capita consumption of about 300
liters, almost four times that of the local populations.
</li><li>Other than the period 1991 - 1992 that is considered to be
an abnormal period in which rare weather conditions affected the
area, the consumption habits of the local population have followed
an increasing trend.
</li><li>The Ramallah region is considered to be relatively urbanized
and contains more industries than most areas in Palestine, however,
the industrial water consumption and the commercial consumption
is 8.7% for both.
</li><li>The water supply/ km pipe/ day ratio has increased over the
past four years. While the length of the distribution network
has increased by about 6.6% in the past four years, the total
supply (produced and purchased water) has increased by about 20%
during the same period.
</li><li>Personnel costs have on the whole increased in the past four
years. The staff/[1000] water connection's ratio shows no apparent
trend, the [1000]m<sup>3</sup> sold/year/staff has actually decreased slightly,
the km pipe/staff ratio has decreased but this is probably a reflection
of the slowness of the network growth and the Intifada.
