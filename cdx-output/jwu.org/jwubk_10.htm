<center><h2><em>QUALITY OF WATER</em></h2></center>

<bold><h3>Monitoring and Treatment</h3></bold>

Problems that occur in the JWU water system that reflect on water quality and thus health issues are ordinary and of low occurrence - such as contamination of lines due to back pressure and possible infiltration from sewage disposal tanks or tankers.  Only two isolated incidents of water contamination from factories have occurred to JWU; one was backwash from a detergent factory and the other was animal blood from a slaughtering facility.


<title>JWU - Quality Of Water

<p>
There is no unit for water quality measurement within the administration
of the JWU.  In fact, there is currently no water utility or water
department in the Palestinian Territory that has a water monitoring
laboratory. A laboratory and water monitoring section is in the
short term plans for the JWU.  Currently, the JWU does have a
pilot water monitoring system with the sample analyses being done
at Birzeit University by contract.
</p><p>
JWU periodically samples the water for testing and analysis to
determine water quality and safety. Also, water samples are taken
from different locations in the network to detect any bacteriological
pollution. In order to cover all areas and locations, each town
or village or camp is divided into 20 - 40 sectors and samples
are taken from each sector and tested for chlorine content and
pollution.
</p><p>
The aim of JWU is to ensure the supply of clean and safe water
to its consumers and to stay vigilant in case of any changes of
the contents at the source.

<b>Bacteriological Tests: </b>
</p><p>
These tests are performed on daily basis. Each sector of the area
is tested 4 - 6 times every year. The actual number of tests depends
on actual needs and is adjusted accordingly as in the case of
older or worn sections of the network. These tests are:
</p><ul>
<li>Facal coliform group
</li><li>Total coliforms
</li><li>Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( as needed)
</li></ul>

<p>

</p><p>
At the present time, all of these tests are performed at the Center
for Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences at Bir-Zeit
University. A trained employee collects the water samples and
deliver them to the lab where the tests take place and the results
are put into the computer and compared with standards and previous
results and draw conclusions from such data.
</p><p>
Additionally, the West Bank Water Department performs from time
to time its own tests on samples of drinking water taken from
JWU wells. The Government Health Department also performs same
tests on samples taken from consumer's dwelling.
</p><p>
Water produced from JWU wells has proven to be safe, clean and
in no need for treatment. Its salt contents and PH value are considered
normal. Nevertheless, JWU continuously treat the water with chlorine
gas to ensure that it conforms to recognized safety standards.
</p><p>
JWU is in the process of establishing its own well equipped laboratory
to make daily testing more readily available.
