<h2><center><i>National and International Cooperation</i></center></h2>

For the last 28 years, JWU built up an excellent reputation locally and internationally. JWU was mentioned in the World Bank Report (Volume V) that was published in  September 1993 more than once  as the most efficient and best run water authority in the West Bank and Gaza. 

Jerusalem Water Undertaking with its limited capabilities and human resources, plays a major role in participating in major activities whether initiated by JWU or by the communities it serves.

THE NATIONAL LEVEL</b>
</p><p>
The following are samples of some JWU activities:
</p><p>
<b>National Public Awareness Campaign.</b>
</p><p>
With the participation of many Agencies and Non-Governmental Organizations,
and the UNDP, an awareness network was established to make the
public aware of the water shortage problems and how to ration
the use of it. JWU established an in house committee to find ways
and means to polish the image of the Undertaking and coordinate
the awareness efforts with the established network. It is important
to mention that a work plan has been designed and parts of it
will be implemented in the coming years. The main points of this
work plan are:
</p><ul>
<li>Selecting the target groups for the awareness campaign to
ration the use of water
</li><li>Improving the image of the Undertaking
</li><li>Improve the awareness of the Undertaking's employees in as
far as the Undertaking's local, national and international activities.
</li></ul>

<p>
Also, the JWU Board of Directors decided to participate with municipalities
and other organizations in the region to facilitate the work of
the Solid Waste and Waste Water Treatment Committee that was established
with the full support of the GTZ and the UNDP. The committee's
main function is to look for the most efficient ways and means
to dispose of solid waste in a safe manner.
</p><p>
<b>Training</b>
</p><p>
Jerusalem Water Undertaking realizes the importance of improving
the capacity of the water sector employees in general and its
human resources in specific. Keeping up with modern methods that
meet international standards necessitates having appropriate training
program in place, to meet the training requirements of the Undertaking.
JWU sees itself in the near future as a regional training center
in the Water and Waste Water fields. International organizations
such as the World Bank, GTZ and CDG and UNDP are working with
the Undertaking to develop a training concept and facilities that
will benefit the Undertaking and the region as a whole.
</p><p>
CDG planned a training workshop that was held in Bethlehem in
March of 1995 for which JWU was a facilitator. JWU professionals
and other organizations in the West Bank and Gaza were invited
to come up with a training program in the water and waste water
fields. The outcome of the workshop was a comprehensive report
on training in the fields of water supply and waste water management.
Problems and training needs have been identified and a training
program was developed.
</p><p>
GTZ on the other hand signed an agreement with JWU in which improving
the management and staff skills is one of the results expected
after three years.
</p><p>
JWU conducted a training program for staff from 6 West Bank villages.
This training session, was funded by the UNDP and it required
the participation of more than 20 management and staff members
from JWU to conduct training lectures after work hours and on
the job training for 6 weeks. The participants of this training
session benefited greatly and UNDP was extremely pleased with
the results of this training. A training booklet for technicians
and accountants was published by JWU. It included the lectures,
the training materials, diagrams, specifications and methods to
be followed in managing the small scale water utilities. Another
group from two villages also sponsored by the UNDP started training
at the Undertaking in October 1995.
</p><p>
Additionally, JWU is constantly providing on the job training
for graduates of educational and vocational institutions in the
West Bank. These graduates gain the knowledge provided by the
many years of experience the employees of JWU posses and go into
the work market prepared in their fields.
</p><p>
JWU is also very keen on providing training for its own staff.
During the last few years a number of its employees were sent
abroad for administrative and technical training and many participated
in courses sponsored by local universities and continuing education
institutions, to enhance their knowledge and expand their know
how.
</p><p>
JWU initiated and implemented a rotating employment program for
2-6 months periods to absorb some of the community un employed
and provide training to the graduates of education and vocational
institutions.
</p><p>
<b>Workshops </b>
</p><p>
During the last few years, JWU was a major contributor and participant
in many workshops held locally and abroad. These workshops were
sponsored by either local or international organizations and covered
field such as integration of water and sewerage authorities, water
resources management, rehabilitation of water networks, water
authorities institutional development, public awareness, water
cost, water saving and planning for the training needs of the
water authorities in the area. In all events, JWU was chosen to
participate in these workshops due to its favorable reputation
and its wealth of technical and administrative knowledge and the
readiness of its management and staff to contribute to the improvement
of their organization.

<p>
<b>Studies</b>
</p><p>
Due to its leadership position in the water aspects, JWU was involved
in many studies in the last few years. These studies were either
conducted exclusively by JWU management and staff, or with the
help of local and international experts. The following is a sample
of studies and a brief description of each one:
</p><ul>
<li><b>Institutional Development Study.</b>
</li></ul>

<p>
This study was initiated by the Jerusalem Water Undertaking (JWU)
- Ramallah District with the aim of developing its institutional
systems and plans through the revision of its organizational and
salary structures as well as the introduction of new personnel
policies and systems including job and employee ranking, performance
appraisal and retirement plans.
</p><p>
Although the need for this study has been realized by JWU management
for years, the unstable situation in the West Bank since 1987,
did not make it possible to initiate and implement it until now.
The study was initiated by the JWU General Manager with the approval
of the Board of Directors. It was conducted by JWU employees under
the direct supervision of the General Manager and with the final
approval of the Board of Directors. Various aspects of this study,
especially the job evaluation process, were carried out through
the Job Description Committee which includes two members of the
Board, the General Manager, an employee representative and the
committee coordinator.
</p><ul>
<li><b>Water and SewerAIntegration Study. </b>
</li></ul>

<p>
This study was conducted by JWU General Manager and El Bireh Municipality
Chief Engineer with support from the UNDP. The main issue that
this study dealt with, is the existence of an efficient and well
organized framework for the management of water and sewerage in
Palestine. This is an essential factor in the effort to conserve
water resources and control usage and demand. The final revision
of this study is available at the offices of the Undertaking.
</p><p>
<b>JWU staff and local experts contributed and participated in
three studies ( Water Resources Management, Water Saving and Water
Cost ) that were funded and sponsored by THE INSTITUE MEDITERRANEAN
DEL'AU STUDIES ( IME ). Copies of these studies are available
