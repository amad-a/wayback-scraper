<font face="arial,helvetica">
Some questions should come to mind as to how useful caching can be, and
when objects should and should not be cached. It is totally inappropriate
to cache (for example) credit card numbers, the results of scripts executed
on remote servers, sites that change often (like
<a href="/cnn.com/" style="pointer-events: none;">www.cnn.com</a>) or even sites that simply
don't want to be cached.
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica">
Squid handles these circumstances elegantly
(but needs the remote sites to work according to the standards, of course).
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica">
Executable cgi-bin scripts are not cached, pages that return the correct
headers are cached for limited periods of time, and you can specify extra
rules as to what, and what not, to cache, and for how long to cache it.
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica">
As to how useful caching can be, especially considering the size of the
Internet, is a different matter. With a small cache (a couple of gigs of
disk space) the returns are remarkably high (up to 25%). This space
catches the <i>very often accessed sites</i>, such as netscape, cnn and some
of the other <i>biggies</i>. If you double the disk space, though, your
don't double your hit rate. This is because you then start trying to catch
the rest of the net, which is generally <i>huge and seldom accessed</i>.
A very large cache, 20 gigs or so, will probably still get less than
50%, unless you are very agressive as to how long you keep data (normally
you can't fill 20 gigs of disk space because pages become stale too
soon, and are deleted.

Whenever we refer to an <b>object</b> in this guide we are actually refering
to a <b>saved web page</b> or other such downloadable page (a ftp file
or directories' contents is also called an object)
