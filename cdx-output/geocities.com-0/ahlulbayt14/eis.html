<p align="justify">The Holy Prophet (s) said: "There are two groups of myUmmah that when they are pious, my Ummah will be upright and when they are immoral my Ummah will be corrupt." The Messenger of Allah (s) was asked who they were, and he answered: "The religious scholars and rulers." Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 2, p. 49
</p><p align="justify">The Holy Prophet (s) said: "O' Ali! Gabriel wished to become a human being for seven reasons, which are:
</p><p>1.Congregational prayer.
<br>2.Companionship with scholars.
<br>3.Establishing peace between two persons.
<br>4.Honouring the orphans.
<br>5.Visiting the sick.
<br>6.Attending a funeral procession.
<br>7.Giving of water to Pilgrims.
</p><p>Then, be desirous of these things." Al -'Ithna 'Ashariyyah, p. 245
</p><p align="justify">Imam Amir al-Mu'mineen Imam Ali (a) said: "When the utterance of the wise is to the point, it serves as a remedy, but if it is wrong it proves like an illness." Nahjul-Balagha, saying No. 265
</p><p align="justify">Imam Amir al-Mu'mineen Ali (a) said: " ...The reward of a religious scholar is greater than the reward of a person who is fasting on days and est ablishes prayers during the night and fights in the Holy War for the sake of Allah. And, when a religious scholar dies, there will appear a gap in Islam which cannot be compensated except by a replacement of that (kind)." Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 2, p. 43
</p><p align="justify">Imam Amir al-Mu'mineen Ali (a) told Kumayl: O' Kumayl! Those who compile wealth are dead even though theymay be living, while the sages (who are endowed with knowledge) will remain as long as the world remains. Their bodies perish but their depictions will exist in the hearts." Nahjul-Balagha, saying No.147
</p><p align="justify">Imam Husain (a) said: "...Verily, the paths to Muslims' affairs and the religious ordinances are in the hands of the godly scholars who are the trusties of Allah in His lawful and unlawful things. ..." Tuhaful-'Uqul, p.172
</p><p align="justify">Imam Baqir (a) said: "When confronting a sage, try to be more inquisitive than talkative, and learn how to listen well as much as you learn how to speak well, and do not interrupt the statement of anyone." Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 1, p. 222
</p><p align="justify">Imam Rida, the eighth Imam, (a) said: "Beware that surely a (true religious) jurist is he who pours forth his benediction unto people, saves them from their enemies, multiplies the blessings of Heaven for them, and earns the Pleasure of Allah the Exalted, for them (through guidance)."  Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 2, p. 5
</p><p align="justify">Imam Hassan al-'Askari, the eleventh Imam, (a) said: "The scholars of our followers (Shi'ah) are the guards of the bounds of Islam. Then, anyone of our followers who undertakes this (duty) is superior to the one who fights in the battle against the Romans, (because this one defends the theological bounds of our followers)." al-Ihtijaj, vol. 2, p. 155
