<p align="center">The Fast of 'Ashura
</p></b></font><p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizvi</b></font>
</p><p></p><hr size="1">
<p align="justify">Some traditions are found in Sunni books to the
effect that the Prophet (s) on migrating to
Medina found the Jews fasting on the 10th of
Muharram. He asked them why, and was told: "It
is an auspicious day; it is the day when God
delivered the children of Israel from their
enemy (i.e. Pharaoh); and, therefore, Moses
fasted on that day." The Prophet (s) said,
"I am worthier of Moses than you are."
Thereupon, he fasted on that day and ordered
(the Muslims) to fast.

[ Sahih al-Bukhari and Mishkat al-Masabih ]

</p><p align="justify">It is noted by the commentator of
Mishkatul-Masabih that "it was in the second
year, because in the first year the Prophet had
arrived at Medina after 'Ashura, in Rabi'ul-awwal."

</p><p align="justify">How much importance was this fast supposed to
have may be judged from another tradition
narrated in al-Sahih of. al-Bukhari: "The
Prophet (s) ordered a man from the (tribe
of) Aslam: Announce to the people that whoever
has eaten should fast the rest of the day, and
whoever has not eaten should fast (the whole
day), because today is the 'Ashura (10th day of Muharram)."

</p><p align="justify">That very year the fast of Ramadan was ordained
and the obligation to fast on 'Ashura was
abrogated, as has been claimed in other
traditions narrated in the same book. Still,
reportedly, it carries much importance as a
voluntary fast.

</p><p>Now let us look closely at these traditions:

</p><p align="justify">First: The Jews had their own calendar and
months. There is no logic in saying that they
fasted on the 10th of Muharram - unless it could
be proved that this date always coincided with a
Jewish day of fast.

</p><p align="justify">It was mentioned in my article, "Martyrdom of
Imam Husayn and the Muslim and the Jewish
Calendars" (Alserat, Vol.VI, No's 3 &amp; 4;
Muharram 1401 Nov.1980) that the first month of
the Jews (Abib, later named Nisan) coincided
with Rajab of the Arabs. W.O.E.Oesterley and
Theodore H.Robinson have written that in Arabia
"the most important of all the new-moon
festivals was that which fell in the month of
Ragab (sic), equivalent to the Hebrew month
'Abib, for this was the time when the ancient
Arabs celebrated the Spring festival." (Hebrew
Religion; S.P.C.K., London; 1955; p.128)

</p><p align="justify">Probably, in ancient times the two branches of
Abraham's house followed the same system of
intercalating an additional month 7 times in a
cycle of 19 years. And in this way the 7th
Jewish month, Tishri I, coincided with Muharram.
And the 'Ashura of Muharram synchronized with
10th of Tishri I, the Jewish Day of Atonement -
a day of fast. In that article, it was observed
that the two calendars lost their
synchronization when Islam, in the 9th year of
hijra, disallowed intercalation. But on deeper
consideration it transpired that that parity was
lost long before the advent of Islam, because
the Arabs did not follow any mathematical
calculation in their intercalation. That was why
the Muharram of the 2nd year of Hijra began on
5th July, 623 C.E. (Al-Munjid, 21st ed.), months
before Tishri I (which always coincides with
September-October).

</p><p align="justify">Clearly, 'Ashura of Muharram in that year (or,
for that matter, during the Prophet's whole life
at Medina) had no significance whatsoever for the Jews.

</p><p>The question is: Why did they fast on that day?

</p><p align="justify">Second: The Jewish Midrashic literature relates
the 10th day of the 7th month (Yom Hakippurim -
Day of Atonement) to the event of bringing the
tablets of the Covenant from Mount Sinai, as Dr.
Mishael Maswari-Caspi has written in his letter,
quoted in my previous article, mentioned above.

</p><p align="justify">The question is: If the Jews had wanted to keep
the long-lost synchronization of Tishri I and
Muharram in view, how was it that they forgot to
narrate this tradition to the Prophet?

</p><p align="justify">Third: The month in which God delivered the
Israelites from Pharaoh was Abib (i.e. Rajab),
as the Bible clearly says: "Observe the month of
Abib, and keep the passover unto the Lord thy
God: for in the month of Abib the Lord thy God
brought thee forth out of Egypt by night." (Deut., 16:1)

</p><p align="justify">The question is: How could the Jews transfer an
event of Abib (originally coinciding with Rajab)
to Muharram, in open defiance of their Torah?

</p><p align="justify">And lastly here is a point to ponder for the
Muslims: The Prophet (s) was sent with a
religion to abrogate all previous religions and
shari'ah. How was it that he deigned to imitate
the custom of the Jews?

</p><p align="justify">It is clear from above-mentioned facts that the
Jews had no reason at all to fast on 'Ashura of
Muharram at that period; and this story, built
on that premise, is just that - a fiction.
Obviously, it was invented by a narrator who
only knew that once upon a time Muharram
coincided with the Jews' Tishri I; but was
totally unaware of contemporary Jewish religion and culture.

</p><p align="justify">One feels constrained to mention here that this
and other such traditions were forged by
camp-followers of the Umayyads, after the
martyrdom of Imam Husayn, as a part of their
campaign to turn the 10th of Muharram into a day
of rejoicing. These traditions are of the same
genre as those which say that it was on the 10th
of Muharram that Noah's ark rested on Mount
Arafat, the fire became cool and safe for
Abraham, and Jesus ascended to the heaven. In
the same category came the traditions exhorting
the Muslims to treat 'Ashura as a festival of
joy, and to store one's food-grain on this very
day as it would increase one's sustenance and
bring the blessings of Allah to the household.
</p><p align="center"><b><a href="http://www.al-shia.org/html/ara/books/maqalat/ashoor01.htm">The Fast of 'Ashura In Arabic </a></b>

</p><p></p><hr size="1">

<p align="justify">THE 1400th year of the hijra caleadar is nearing
its end. Since the last two years or more a
substantial amount of time, energy and money is
being spent of what has come to be known as the
commemoration of the end of the 14th century of
hijra and the welcome of the 15th. Seminars are
being held, articles written, booklets
published, postage stamps issued and a lot of
trinkets designed, made and sold to honour this
occasion. Not even the ruling dynasty of Saudi
Arabia seems to mind that all these
festivities financed with petro-dollars and
arranged with the active blessings of their
religious leaders—are innovations (bid'ah),
which the Muslims of even a century ago knew
nothing about.

</p><p align="justify">It is, of course, the natural offspring of a
process started a few decades ago when western
imperialism established its hold in the Middle
East. The Muslims of Egypt and some other
countries began celebrating the (Muslim) New
Year on 1st Muharram. By this act, they
introduced a new "festival" in Islam.

</p><p align="justify">Of course, the justifications are many. It is
claimed that these 14thcentury functions are
held "to assess the impact of Islam on humanity
and the contribution of Muslims to various
branches of learning and in the upliftment of
human society", "to probe into the past
successes and failures" and "to hammer out new
plans for the future".

</p><p align="justify">Noble ideas, indeed. And nobody—least of all,
the present writer— would deny their relevance
and validity. But these rationalizations do not
alter the fact that this celebration is an
innovation (bid'ah). If such commendable goals
may justify this innovation, then one has a
right to ask these Muslims as to why they
condemn the commemoration of the martyrdom of
Imam Husayn as an unlawful act ? Is not this
mourning justified on these very grounds? The
remembrance of Imam Husayn's supreme sacrifice
on the altar of truth strengthens the moral
fibre of the Muslims; keeps their feet firmly on
the path of righteousuess and piety; and creates
in them a willingness to sacrifice their all in
the way of Allah. It also helps the mourners in
"probing their successes and failures" of the
past year, and in "chalking out a new plan" for
their religious, spiritual and social
"upliftment for the future."

</p><p>The principle should always remain the same,
shouldn't it ?

</p><p align="justify">Lest there be any misunderstanding, it should be
clarified here that the mourning for Imam Husayn
is not a bid 'ah (innovation) at all. It was
started by the Holy Prophet of Islam himself,
more than 50 years before the event; and he was
seen in a vision by the Mother of the believers,
Umm Salmah, on the day of Husayn's martyrdom,
mourning for Husayn. And Allah has ordered
thousands of angels to weep on the grave of Imam
Husayn till the day of resurrection. These
traditions are narrated in the Sunni books, and
show that this particular mourning is the sunnah
of the Holy Prophet and of the angels:
</p><ol>
<li><p align="justify">Some 50 years before the event of Karbala,
the Prophet wept when he was told by the angel
that Husayn would be killed by the army of Yazid
in Karbala. Then Gabriel asked, "O Prophet of
God, do you want me to give you some earth from
his place of martyrdom ?" The Prophet said,
"Yes". Gabriel gave him a handful of earth of
Karbala and the Prophet began weeping
uncontrollably. This tradition is recorded in
Mishkatul-Masabih, Musnad of Imam Ahmad bin
Hanbal, as-Sawaiqul Muhriqah of Allamah Ibn
Hajar Makki and Sirrul-'alamin of Imam Ghazali;
and has been narrated by Imam Sha'abi, Imam
Baihaqi, Imam Hakim and scores of other
traditionalists. The Prophet gave that earth to
his wife, Ummul Mu'mineen, Umm Salmah, and told
her, "When you see this earth turned into blood,
know that Husayn has been martyred."

</p></li><li><p align="justify">On the 10th Muharram, 61 A.H., Umm Salmah was
asleep in the afternoon when she saw the Prophet
in her dream: He stood there in a tragic
coadition, his hair was dusty and dishevelled,
and in his hand was a bottle full of blood. Umm
Salmah asked him what it was. The Prophet said,
"This is the blood of Husayn and his companions.
I was collecting it since this morning." Umm
Salmah woke up and hurried towards the bottle
which contained the earth of Karbala; she saw
red blood flowing from it. Then she cried and
called her relatives and started mourning for
Husayn. This tradition is narrated in Musnad of
Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, as-Sawaiqul Muhriqah,
Mishkatul-Masabih, Sahih of Tirmidhi and other books.

</p></li><li><p align="justify">Shaikh 'Abdul Qadir Jilani writes ia his book
Ghunyatut-Talebeen, Vol. II page 62; "70,000
angels came on the grave of Husayn bin 'Ali
after his martyrdom and they are weeping on him
and will remain weeping unto the Day of Judgement."

</p></li><li><p align="justify">Allah says in the Quran about Pharaoh and his
army: "neither the Sky nor the Earth wept for
them and they were not given chance." (ad-Dukhaan, Verse 29).
Imam Muslim records in explanation of this ayat,
"When Husayn was martyred, the Sky as well as
the Earth wept on him and weeping of the sky is
its being red." (Sahih of Muslim).
</p></li></ol>

<p align="justify">It is a sign of the greatness of the 10th
Muharram that Allah commanded the Israelites to
observe it as a day of mourning; it was
accompanied by a stern warning that anybody
disobeying that law would be cut off from his
tribe. The following is the passage quoted from
Leviticus (Chapter 23, verses 23-32):
</p><p align="justify">And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak
unto the children of Israel, saying, in the
seventh month, in the first day of the month,
shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing
of trumpets, an holy convocation. Ye shall do no
servile work therein; but ye shall offer an
offering made by fire unto the Lord And the Lord
spake unto Moses, saying, Also on the tenth day
of this seventh month there shall be a day of
atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto
you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer
an offering made by fire unto the Lord. And ye
shall do no work in that same day: for it is a
day of atonement, to make an atonement for you
before the Lord your God. For whatsoever soul it
be that shall not be afflicted in that same day,
he shall be cut off from among his people. And
whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in
that same day, the same soul will I destroy from
among his people. Ye shall do no manner of work;
it shall be a stature for ever throughout your
generations in all your dwellings. It shall be
unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict
your souls: in the ninth day of the month at
even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate
your sabbath.

</p><p align="justify">This command is also briefly mentioned in
Leviticus 16: 29-34. To understand what is meant
by the seventh month, the following facts should
be kept in mind:
</p><ol>
<li><p align="justify">The year of the Hebrews was based on lunar
system. To make it coincide with solar
year, a thirteenth month, Veadar, was added
7 times in a cycle of 19 years. The year
began with the month of Abib (i.e., Nisan)
with the new moon next before or next after
the spring equinox.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The Arabs before Islam used to follow the
same system. Thus their months coincided
with the Jewish months; and Rajab coincided
with Abib (i.e., Nisan) of the Jews. And
the Jewish 7th month coincided with
Muharram of the Arabs. (In original Hebrew
reckoning, this seventh month was called
Ethanim; now it is called Tishri I). As the
original Jewish year began near the spring
equinox (i.e. 21st March of the Gregorian
calendar), the seventh month was bound to
occur in SeptemberOctober.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Some time after the Exile, the Jews changed
the new year from Nisan to the day of the
new moon of the 7th month. Now it is their
first month; except that the system of
fasting and observing other laws concerning
the 1st, 9th and 10th days (of the 7th
month) mentioned above continues unchanged.
Yom Hakippurim is faithfully observed with
all due solemnity on the 10th day of the
original seventh (i.e. the present first)
month. (The Hebrew term, Yom Hakippurim, is
rendered as Yaum-ul-Kaffarah in Arabic and
Day of Atonement in English. In 1973, the
world became familiar with the term 'Yom
Kippur' when Egypt chose that day to start
war with Israel, and thus caught them
unprepared—the whole country was engaged in
observing the fast and other rules of the
Day of Atonement).
</p></li><li><p align="justify">In the 9th year of Hijra, Islam forbade
intercalation of the additional month every
leap year. "Surely the number of months
with Allah is twelve . . . Postponing (of a
month, i.e. by intercalation) is only an
addition in disbelief..." (Quran, 9:
37-38) From then on, the parity between the
Jewish and the Muslim calendars
disappeared.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">In spite of that disparity, the Muharram of
61 A.H. began with Tishri I; and 10th
Muharram, the day when Imam Husayn was
martyred was 10th Tishri (Yom Hakippurim).
See, for reference, the chart comparing the
Hijra and Christian calendars, given in the
21st edition of al-Munjid. Thus the
relationship of Yom Hakippurim with 10th
Muharram was true not only because
originally Muharram used to coincide with
Tishri, but also because the martyrdom
actually occurred on that very day.
</p></li></ol>
<p align="justify">I once discussed this commandment with Professor
N. Q. King, of California University. I told him
that, as apparently no significant historical
event had happened on that day in Jewish
history, one might safely say that it was a sort
of prognosis of the martyrdom of Imam Husayn.
The Professor wrote about it to his colleague,
Dr. Mishael Maswari-Caspi, who very kindly wrote
to me on March 28, 1978. In this letter, he
writes, inter alia, on this subject as follows:

</p><p align="justify">"If there is a link between the 10th of
Al-Muharram and Yom Hakippurim, it is not just a
coincidence, but emphasizes that we are truly
close to each other." He agreed that "in both
places, Leviticus 23 and Leviticus 16,
historicization is not emphasized. Nor is the
historical connection brought out in Tractate
Yoms, the tractate dealing in many details of
the Day of Atonement." He further writes that
"although no historical correlation is found,
the spiritual and religious aspects are of
utmost importance in both Bible and Talmud,
whereas in the Midrashic literature (Midrash
Tanhuma, Tisa 31) they relate this holy day to
the event of bringing the tablets of the
Covenant from Mount Sinai. It says 'The first
time he went down on the 17th of Tammuz. He saw
the calf and he broke the tablets. For two days
he punished the people. He remained there from
the 20th of Tammuz through the whole month of
Ab, 40 days. Then he went up on the first day of
Elul, staying 40 days, being the 10th of
Tishri.' This is why this holy day is devoted to
atonement, and this is why the High Priest
entered the Holy of Holies not in his fancy
cloth wiah stripes of gold (reminiscent of the
golden calf), but in a purely white garment."

</p><p align="justify">In view of the fact that the original
commandment of Leviticus, as well as Tractate
Yoms, does not refer to any historicization, one
may safely say that the event mentioned in
Midrash Tanhu1na, Tisa 31, had no bearing, as a
historical event, on this commandment. Rather it
is the spiritual and religious aspects that are
of paramount importance. The spiritual
significance of bringing the tablets of the
Covenant may be one of those aspects And so may
be the prognosis of the martyrdom of Imam Husayn
not as a historical event but as a spiritual
guiding light.

</p><p align="justify">It is not uncommon about the early events of the
Islamic history, and especially so if they
happened in Muharram or Safar, that a difference
of one year appears in their timing in various
narrations. For example, the martyrdom of Imam
Husayn is said to happen on 10th Muharram, in
the year 60, or the year 61, depending on
various reports. But in fact, in most cases,
there is no material difference between the two.
Both speak of the same year—one calling it the
60th, and the other the 61st, year after Hijrah
The reason for this confusing discrepancy is as
follows: As mentioned earlier, in pre-Islamic
days the year of the Arabs coincided with that
of the Jews—Muharram was identical with the
first (i.e. the original seventh) month of the
Jewish calendar. When the Holy Prophet migrated
to Medina in the month of Rabi'ul-awwal, the
Muslims on the order of the Prophet himself
started the Muslim calendar. They said that this
or that event occurred in this or that month
after Hijrah. This continued "till a year was
completed", and then they began saying that a
certain event occurred in the first or second
year of Hijrah; and so on. And in this way the
Hijra calendar was established.

</p><p align="justify">Reports to this effect are given in the Annals
of al-Tabari (Prima series, E. J. Brill, Laden,
ed. 1882-1885) Vol. III p. 1250 from Ibn Shahab,
Ibn 'Abbas and 'Amr b. Dinar; and in Vol. V, p.
2480, from Ibn 'Abbas.

</p><p align="justify">It may be inferred from the words, "till a year
was completed", that the year began with
Rabi'ul-awwal and ended with Safar.

</p><p align="justify">Accordiag to another narrative, the Hijrah
calendar was established in the region of the
2nd Caliph, in 16th year after Hijrah. The
reparts to this effect are found in the same two
places of the Annals of al-Tabari. According to
this narrative (of Sa'id b. Al-Musayyab), 'Umar
gathered the people and asked them: From which
day should we write (the Calendar) ? 'Ali said:
From the day the Apostle of Allah migrated and
left the land of polytheism. So 'Umar did so."

</p><p align="justify">The day whea the Holy Prophet left Mecca was 1st
Rabi'ul-awwal. (Safinatul-Bihar, Vol. 2, p. 696).

</p><p align="justify">It appears from the first narrative that the
Muslim year began with the month of
Rabi'ul-awwal; and that it was done by the order
of the Prophet himself And if the second
narrative is correct, then 'Ali had advised to
start the year from Rabi'ul-awwal, an advice
that according to this report, the second caliph accepted.

</p><p align="justify">But the Arabs were accustomed to count Muharram
as the first month, and old habits die hard; and
that is why many people continued to follow that
custom. That is the only explanation why
Muharram came to be counted as first month of
the Hijrah calendar. Obviously, this month had
nothing to do with the Hijrah the event upon
which the Muslim year is based. There is a
report ia the same Annals, from Muhammad b.
Sirin that the people, after discussion, had
unanimously agreed to begin the year with
Muharram. But obviously this report is an
attempt to justify the practice which by the
time of Ibn Sirin (d. 110 A.H.) had firmly
established itself in the Muslim society.

</p><p align="justify">For those who, in early days, counted
Rabi'ul-awwal as the first month, Muharram was
the 11th month of the old year; for others it
was the 1st month of the new year. Thus by the
former reckoning, Imam Husayn was martyred in
Muharram that was the 11th month of the year 60
A.H.; by the later reckoning, the same Muharram
was the 1st month of the year 61 A.H.
