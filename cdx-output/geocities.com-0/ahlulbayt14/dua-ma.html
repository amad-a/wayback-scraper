<p align="center"><b>Bism Allah al-Rahman al-Rahim</b>

</p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless
Muhammad and his Household, cause my faith to reach the most perfect
faith, make my certainty the most excellent certainty,<br>
and take my intention to the best of intentions and my works to the
best of works! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, complete my intention through Thy gentleness,
rectify my certainty through what is with Thee, and set right what is
corrupt in me through Thy power! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and his
Household, spare me the concerns which distract me, employ me in that
about which Thou wilt ask me tomorrow, and let me pass my days in that
for which Thou hast created me! Free me from need, expand Thy
provision toward me, and tempt me not with ingratitude! Exalt me and
afflict me not with pride! Make me worship Thee and corrupt not my
worship with self-admiration! Let good flow out from my hands upon the
people and efface it not by my making them feel obliged! Give me the
highest moral traits and preserve me from vainglory! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless
Muhammad and his Household, raise me not a single degree before the
people without lowering me its like in myself and bring about no
outward exaltation for me without an inward abasement in myself to the
same measure! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and Muhammad's Household, give me
to enjoy a sound guidance which I seek not to replace, a path of truth
from which I swerve not, and an intention of right conduct in which I
have no doubts! Let me live as long as my life is a free gift in
obeying Thee, but if my life should become a pasture for Satan, seize
me to Thyself before Thy hatred overtakes me or Thy wrath against be
becomes firm! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, deposit in me no quality for which I will be
faulted, unless Thou settest it right, no flaw for which I will be
blamed, unless Thou makest it beautiful, no deficient noble trait,
unless Thou completest it! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and Muhammad's
Household and replace for me the animosity of the people of hatred
with love, the envy of the people of insolence with affection, the
suspicion of the people of righteousness with trust, the enmity of
those close with friendship, the disrespect of womb relatives with
devotion, the abandonment of relatives with help, the attachment of
flatterers with love set right, the rejection of fellows with generous
friendliness, and the bitterness of the fear of wrongdoers with the
sweetness of security! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and his Household,
appoint for me a hand against him who wrongs me, a tongue against him
who disputes with me, and a victory over him who stubbornly resists
me! Give me guile against him who schemes against me, power over him
who oppresses me, refutation of him who reviles me, and safety from
him who threatens me! Grant me success to obey him who points me
straight and follow him who guides me right! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and
his Household and point me straight to resist him who is dishonest
toward me with good counsel, repay him who separates from me with
gentle devotion, reward him who deprives me with free giving,
recompense him who cuts me off with joining, oppose him who slanders
me with excellent mention, give thanks for good, and shut my eyes to
evil! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and his Household, adorn me with the
adornment of the righteous, and clothe me in the ornaments of the
godfearing, through spreading justice, restraining rage, quenching the
flame of hate, bringing together the people of separation, correcting
discord, spreading about good behaviour, covering faults, mildness of
temper, lowering the wing, beauty of conduct, gravity of bearing,
agreeableness in comportment, precedence in reaching excellence,
preferring bounteousness, refraining from condemnation, bestowing
bounty on the undeserving, speaking the truth, though it be painful,
making little of the good in my words and deeds, though it be much,
and making much of the evil in my words and deeds, though it be
little! Perfect this for me through lasting obedience, holding fast to
the community, and rejecting the people of innovation and those who
act in accordance with original opinions! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and
his Household, appoint for me Thy widest provision in my old age and
Thy strongest strength when I am exhausted, try me not with laziness
in worship of Thee, blindness toward Thy path, undertaking what
opposes love for Thee, joining with him who has separated himself from
Thee, and separating from him who has joined himself to Thee! </p><p align="justify">O Allah,
make me leap to Thee in times of distress, ask from Thee in needs, and
plead to Thee in misery! Tempt me not to seek help from other than
Thee when I am distressed, to humble myself in asking from someone
else when I am poor, or to plead with someone less than Thee when I
fear, for then I would deserve Thy abandonment, Thy withholding, and
Thy turning away, O Most Merciful of the merciful! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, make the
wishing, the doubt, and the envy which Satan throws into my heart a
remembrance of Thy mightiness, a reflection upon Thy power, and a
devising against Thy enemy! Make everything he causes to pass over my
tongue, - the indecent or ugly words, the maligning of good repute,
the false witness, the speaking ill of an absent man of faith or the
reviling of one present, and all things similar - a speech in praise
of Thee, a pursual of eulogizing Thee, an excursion in magnifying
Thee, a thanksgiving for Thy favour, an acknowledgement of Thy
beneficence, and an enumeration of Thy kindnesses! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless
Muhammad and his Household, let me not be wronged while Thou canst
repel from me, let me not do wrong while Thou art powerful over
holding me back, let me not be misguided while Thou art able to guide
me, let me not be poor while with Thee is my plenty, let me not be
insolent while from Thee comes my wealth! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, I come to Thy
forgiveness, I go straight to Thy pardon, I yearn for Thy forbearance,
and I trust in Thy bounty, but there is nothing with me to make me
warrant Thy forgiveness, nothing in my works to make me merit Thy
pardon, and nothing on my behalf after I judge my soul but Thy bounty,
so bless Muhammad and his Household and bestow Thy bounty upon me! O
God, make my speech be guidance, inspire me with reverential fear,
give me success in that which is most pure, and employ me in what is
most pleasing to Thee! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, let me tread the most exemplary path and
make me live and die in Thy creed! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and his
Household, give me to enjoy moderation, make me into one of the people
of right behaviour, the proofs of right conduct, and the servants of
righteousness, and provide me with triumph at the place of Return and
safety from the Ambush! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, take to Thyself from my soul what will
purify it and leave for my soul that of my soul that will set it
right, for my soul will perish unless Thou preservest it! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, Thou
art my stores when I sorrow, Thou art my recourse when I am deprived,
from Thee I seek aid when troubled and with Thee is a substitute for
everything gone by, a correction for everything corrupted, and a
change from everything Thou disapprovest. So show kindness to me with
well-being before affliction, wealth before asking, right conduct
before misguidance; suffice me against the burden of shame toward the
servants, give me security on the Day of Return, and grant me
excellent right guidance! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and his Household,
repel from me through Thy gentleness, feed me through Thy favour, set
me right through Thy generosity, heal me through Thy benefaction,
shade me in Thy shelter, wrap me in Thy good pleasure, and give me
success to reach the most guided of affairs when affairs confuse me,
the purest of works when works seem similar, and the most pleasing to
Thee of creeds when creeds conflict! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and his
Household, crown me with sufficiency, place in me excellent
guardianship, give me to guide correctly, tempt me not with plenty,
grant me excellent ease, make not my life toil and trouble, and refuse
not my supplication in rejection, for I make none rival to Thee and I
supplicate none with Thee as equal! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and his
Household, hold me back from prodigality, fortify my provision against
ruin, increase my possessions through blessing them, and set me upon
the path of guidance through piety in what I spend! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless
Muhammad and his Household, spare me the burden of earning, and
provide for me without reckoning, lest I be distracted from Thy
worship through seeking and carry the load of earning's ill results! O
God, bestow upon me what I seek through Thy power and grant me
sanctuary from what I fear through Thy might! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad
and his Household, save my face through ease, and demean not my
dignity through neediness, lest I seek provision from those whom Thou
hast provided and asks for bestowal from the worst of Thy creatures!
Then I would be tried by praising him who gave to me and afflicted
with blaming him who held back from me, while Thou - not they - art
patron of giving and holding back. </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and his
Household and provide me with soundness in worship, detachment in
renunciation, knowledge put into action, and abstinence in measure! O
God, seal my term with Thy pardon, verify my expectation in hoping for
Thy mercy, smooth my paths to reach Thy good pleasure, and make my
works good in all my states! </p></font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="4">O Allah, bless Muhammad and his Household,
incite me to remember Thee in times of heedlessness, employ me in Thy
obedience in days of disregard, open a smooth road for me to Thy love,
and complete for me thereby the good of this world and the next! O
God, and bless Muhammad and his Household the best Thou hast blessed
any of Thy creatures before him and wilt bless any of them after him,
and <em>give to us in this World good, </em>and in the next world
good, and protect me through Thy mercy <em>from the chastisement of
the Fire!</em></font>
