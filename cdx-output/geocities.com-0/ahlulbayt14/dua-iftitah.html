<p>
O Allah, I begin the glorification with praise of Thee;<br>
Thou, from Thy bounties, gives out freely the truth and salvation;<br>
I know for certain that Thou art the most merciful in<br>
        disposition of forgiveness and mercy,<br>
  [but] very exacting at the time of giving<br>
        exemplary punishment and chastisement to wrongdoers,<br>
  the Omnipotent in the domain of absolute power and might.
</p><p>
O Allah, Thou has given me permission to invoke Thee and beseech Thee,<br>
        so listen, O Hearer, to my words of praise,<br>
        and give a favourable reply to my supplication,<br>
        and minimize my falling into misery,<br>
        O the often-forgiving.</p><p>

O my Allah,<br>
    many a trouble Thou hath removed;<br>
    many a sorrow hath Thou dispelled;<br>
    many a misery hath Thou mitigated;<br>
   and at all times Thou spreadeth out mercy,<br>
    and cutteth short the tightening circles of misfortunes.</p><p>

All praise be to Allah,<br>
    Who has not taken unto Himself a wife,<br>
    nor a son,<br>
    and Who has no partner in sovereignty,<br>
    nor any protecting friend through dependence.<br>
Magnify Him with all magnificence.</p><p>

All praise be to Allah,<br>
    with full gratitude for all his bounties.</p><p>

All praise be to Allah,<br>
    Who has no opposition to His rule,<br>
    nor any challenge to His commands.</p><p>

All praise be to Allah,<br>
    Who has no counsel to meddle with His operation of creation,<br>
    nor is there anything similar to Him in His greatness.</p><p>

All praise be to Allah,<br>
    Whose commandments operate in Creation;<br>
    His glory is evident through love and kindness.</p><p>

His distinct overflowing generosity is freely available<br>
    through His unlimited bestowals which do not exhaust His<br>
    resources,<br>
    and He does not swell the numerous benefits<br>
    except because of generosity and kindness.<br>
Verily He is mighty, generous.
</p><p>
O Allah, I ask for some from much,</p><p>
in the midst of my very many needs<br>
    for which I entirely depend on Thee,<br>
and, since eternity, Thou art able to do without it<br>
     but for me it is a titanic effort<br>
     and for Thee is very easy and simple.</p><p>

O Allah, truly, when Thou pardon my sins,<br>
    overlook my mistakes,<br>
    take a lenient view of my disorderly conduct,<br>
    cover up my foul actions,<br>
    show consideration in spite of my many transgressions<br>
    committed willfully or negligently,<br>
       I am tempted to ask for that which I do not deserve,<br>
        from Thee Who, through Thy mercy, gives me the daily bread<br>
        provides me with that which is suitable for me,<br>
        through Thy control;<br>
        and distinguishes me with a favourable reply to my requests.</p><p>

So I persist in calling out,<br>
    believing in Thee,<br>
    and I invoke Thee,<br>
    talking familiarly, not afraid, nor shy,<br>
    but assured of Thy love and kindness whenever I turn to Thee</p><p>

A temporary setback,<br>
    and I, out of ignorance, begin to despair,<br>
    although perhaps slowing down may be a blessing in disguise.<br>
    because Thou alone knows [all] the consequences.<br>
    I know no generous master who is more accommodating to<br>
    dissatisfied servants that Thou art to me.</p><p>

O Lord, Thou giveth an invitation but I turn it down.<br>
        Thou becometh familiar with me but I do not care for Thee.<br>
        Thou loveth me but I do not correspond to Thee as if Thou are<br>
        overreaching me.<br>
Yet Thou doth not abstain from bestowing favours and blessings<br>
        on me from Thy mercy and generosity<br>
        so have mercy on Thy ignorant servant<br>
Verily Thou art generous and kind.</p><p>

Praise be To Allah the owner of sovereignty,<br>
        Who sets the course of the skies and the stars<br>
        controls the winds,<br>
        causes the daybreak,<br>
        and administers authority,<br>
        the Lord of the worlds.</p><p>

Praise be to Allah<br>
    for His indulgence in the wake of His all-awareness.</p><p>

Praise be to Allah<br>
    for His amnesty ensuing from His omnipotence.</p><p>

Praise be To Allah<br>
    for the respite He allows In spite of provocation.<br>
He is able to do what He wills.</p><p>

Praise be to Allah, the creator of all the created beings,<br>
    Who makes sustenance freely available,<br>
    starts the day,<br>
    the owner of glory, might, favours, and bounties,<br>
    Who is far away, invisible, and nearest,<br>
    so near that He is fully aware of the whispered secrets,<br>
    the Blessed, the Praised.</p><p>

Praise be to Allah, Who has no equal to challenge Him,<br>
    nor is there an image comparable to Him,<br>
    nor a helper to assist Him.</p><p>

He tames the powerful by His force,<br>
    and disgraced are the terrible before His greatness;<br>
    so He, through His power, fulfils that which He wills.</p><p>

Praise be to Allah, Who gives answer to me whenever I call Him;<br>
    covers up my shortcomings yet I disobey Him;<br>
    gives me the largest part of the bounties yet I want more.<br>
    Many favours He has sanctioned;<br>
    many terrible dangers He has averted;<br>
    and many blossoming joys he has made available for me.<br>
    Therefore, I sing His praises and recite His glorifications.</p><p>

Praise be to Allah.<br>
None can disclose anything hidden by Him;<br>
    none can shut the doors kept open by Him;<br>
    no one who makes a request is sent away disappointed by Him;<br>
    and no one who looks long and attentively is deluded in his<br>
    hopes.</p><p>

Praise be to Allah, Who gives protection to the frightened;<br>
    comes to the help of the upright;<br>
    promotes the cause of the weak and the enslaved;<br>
    annihilates the autocrats;<br>
    destroys rulers and appoints the 'awaited savours' in their place.</p><p>

Praise be to Allah, Who breaks everything belonging to the oppressors;<br>
        puts an end to the tyrants;<br>
        watches over the fugitives;<br>
        brings assistance to those who cry out for help;<br>
        meets and clears up the demands of the needy beseechers;<br>
        supports the faithful.</p><p>

Praise be to Allah.<br>
        In his awe-inspiring fear the heavens and its dwellers tremble and
        shiver;<br>
        the earth and its inhabitants shake and quiver;<br>
        the oceans and all that floats and swims in its waters<br>
        flow together in excitement and tumult.</p><p>

Praise be to Allah, Who has guided us to this.<br>
We could not truly have been led aright if Allah had not guided us.</p><p>

Praise be to Allah, Who creates but is not created;<br>
        gives subsistence but needs no provisions;<br>
        gives food to eat but takes no nourishment;<br>
        makes the living dead and brings the dead to life;<br>
        and He is the everliving, there is no death for Him;<br>
        in His hands is all the good.</p><p>

And He is able to do all things.<br>
O Allah, send blessings on Muhammad,<br>
        Thy servant, Messenger, confidant, friend, beloved intimate,<br>
        mercy unto all the created beings,<br>
        bearer of Thy sacraments,<br>
        quotient of Thy messengers,<br> 
       the most superior, the exquisite, the most handsome,<br>
        the most perfect, the upright, the more prospering,<br>
        the more pleasant, the thoroughly purified, the sublime;<br>
        who has more and better blessings, advantages, mercies,<br>
        affections and salutations<br>
        than Thou made available to any one of Thy servants,<br>
        prophets, messengers, friends,<br>
        and those honoured by Thee from among Thy created being.</p><p>

O Allah send blessings on 'Ali<br>
    the Leader of the Faithful,<br>
    the successor to the Messenger of the Lord of the worlds,<br>
    Thy servant, Thy beloved representative,<br>
    brother of Thy Messenger,<br>
    Thy decisive argument over mankind,<br>
    Thy most important sign,<br>
    the great news from Thee.</p><p>

O Allah, send blessings on the truthful pure Fatima,<br>
    the chosen leader of the women of the worlds.</p><p>

O Allah, send blessings on the sons of 'the mercy unto the worlds',<br>
    the leaders and guides,<br>
    the Imams al-Hasan and al-Husayn,<br>
    the leaders of the dwellers of Paradise.</p><p>

    'Ali ibn al-Husayn,<br>

    Muhammad ibn'Ali,<br>
    'Ali ibn Muhammad,<br>
    al-Hasan ibn'Ali,<br>
    and his son, the rightly guided Guide,<br>
    Thy decisive argument over Thy servants,<br>
    Thy trustworthy confidant on Thy earth;<br>
    blessings, numerous, and for ever.</p><p>

O Allah, send blessings on the Custodian of thy commandments,<br>
    the vigilant Guardian, the reliable Patron, the awaited Justice,<br>
    surrounded by Thy favourite angels,<br>
    assisted by the Holy Spirit.</p><p>

O Lord of the worlds.<br>
    O Allah, send him to call the people unto Thy Book for
    establishing Thy religion,<br>
    and make him succeed in the earth,<br>
    as Thou caused those who were before him to succeed,<br>
    and establish for him his faith<br>
    which Thou has approved for him,<br>
    and give him in exchange safety after fear.<br>
    He serves Thee.</p><p>

He ascribes nothing as partner unto Thee.</p><p>

O Allah, give him power and authority,<br>
    and through him strengthen the people.<br>
    Give him the necessary assistance,<br>
    and through him support the people,<br>
    and make him prevail over allya final decisive victory,<br>
    and delegate him Thy controlling authority.</p><p>

O Allah, give currency to Thy religion,<br>
    and the way of life of Thy Prophet,<br>
    through him till nothing which is just and genuine<br>
    is kept concealed from any human being.</p><p>

O Allah, we ardently desire that in [his] kind, just, and fair era,<br>
    Thou should reactivate Islam and stimulate its followers,<br>
    and humble and humiliate the imposters and their double-dealing,<br>
    and include us among those who invite people unto Thy
    obedience,<br>
    and lead them to Thy approved path,<br>
    and give us the good of this world and the world to come.</p><p>

O Allah, let us bear out and hold up<br>
    that which Thou maketh known to us as the truth,<br>
    and let us be fully aware of that which we fall short of doing.</p><p>

O Allah, through him, set in order our disorder;<br>
    gather and unite our flock;<br>
    stitch together our sundered separation;<br>
    turn our want and poverty into sufficiency;<br>
    lift us up from our degradation;<br>
    free us from our misery;<br>
    pull us out from our debts;<br>
    help us to get out from the ditch of cares and sorrows;<br>
    fill the gap created by confusion among us;<br>
    let our difficulties be easy to deal with;<br>
    refine our substance and style;<br>
    untie our ropes and straps;<br>
    let our efforts succeed well and secure success;<br>
    make us fulfill our promises;<br>
    give answers to our prayers;<br>
    listen to our requests;<br>
    cause us to obtain the good of this world and the hereafter;<br>
    give us much and more than our expectations,<br>
    O the best of givers and bestowers;<br>
    and cleanse our hearts,<br>
    unburden our emotions from hate and anger,<br>
    and, in the event of dispute in the matter of truth,<br>
    show us the right path.</p><p>

Verily, Thou guides whoever Thou will to the right path.<br>
Let us, through him, get the better of Thy enemies and our
opponents,<br>
    O True God.<br>
Be it so.</p><p>

O Allah, we feel uneasy about and are disturbed by<br>
    the departure of our Prophet,<br>
     Thy blessings be on him and on his family,<br>
     the absence of our guardian-friend,<br>
     too many enemies,<br>
     our numerical scarcity,<br>
     widespread disorder,<br>
     and the vicissitudes of time.</p><p>

So send blessings on Muhammad and on his family,<br>
    and help us to overcome this state of affairs at once.</p><p>

Disperse the ominous clouds hanging over our heads;<br>
    lend a helping hand to achieve success;<br>
    bring in the rule of justice and fair play;<br>
    make us bright, free from grief;<br>
    and take care of us.<br>

Through Thy mercy, O most Merciful.
