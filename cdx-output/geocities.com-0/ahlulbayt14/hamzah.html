<p></p><hr noshade=""> 
<p>Name:  Hamzah Ibn Abdul-Muttalib
</p><p>Kunyat: Abu Umarah
</p><p>Title: Sayyed Al-Shuhadaa, Asadullah
</p><p>Father: Abdul-Muttalib
</p><p>Mother: Fatimah
</p><p>Born:  570 AD Year of the Elephant
</p><p>Brothers: Abdullah, Abu Talib, Abbass, ...
</p><p align="jusitfy">Relation: The Prophet's Uncle, and his foster brother for he was suckled and weaned by the same foster parents.
</p><p></p><hr noshade=""> 
<p>
</p><p align="justify">Hamzah was clearly destined to be a man of great mighty stature, endowed
with great physical strength. He was already a good horseman, skilled with
a sword and a good wrestler in all of Mecca.

</p><p align="justify">He was a man of the desert who liked to be alone. The desert stillness,
with it's desert nights was very pleasing to him than the heat and stink of
Mecca. So it was natural for him to spend days and even weeks alone in the
desert in chase for deer.

</p><p align="justify">On one of his desert trips Hamzah was awakened by a noise. Only to see a
lion had entered his camp. No doubt drawn to the smell of the freshly
killed deer. Alone and armed with only a javiline he not only fought off
the lion bravely but in the process he killed the king of the beasts.

</p><p align="justify">Which he later skinned the lion and threw it over his saddle and rode into
Mecca triumphantly. When the people of Mecca saw the lion's skin they were
greatly awed with admiration and love that from that day on he was warmly
known as the 'Lion of the desert'. His enemies grew to fear him, even on
the mention of his name he was held in great respect.

</p><p align="justify">Hamzah and Abu Jahal

</p><p align="justify">One day, despite himself, Abu Jahal the most spitefull of all the leaders
of Quraysh and the most aggressive enemy to The Holy Prophet
Mohammad (s) and Islam. Indirectly did the new religion a great service.

</p><p align="justify">The Prophet (s) was sitting outside the Mosque near the Safa Gate, so
named because the pilgrims go out through it to perform the rite of passing
seven times between the hill of Safa which is near the gate and the hill of
Marwah some 450 yards to the north. A rock near the foot of Safa marks the
starting point of the ancient rite, and The Prophet (s) was alone at
this hallowed place when AbuJahal came past.

</p><p align="justify">Here was an opportunity for the Makhziimite to show that he at least was
not overawed; and standing in front of The Prophet (s) he proceeded to
revile him with all the abuse he could muster.

</p><p align="justify">The Prophet (s) merely looked at him, but spoke no word; and finally,
Abu Jahal having heaped upon him the worst insults he could think of, he
entered the Mosque to join those of Quraysh who were assembled in the Hijr.

</p><p align="justify">The Prophet (s) in overwhelming sadness slowly rose to his feet and
returned silently to his home.

</p><p align="justify">Hamzah enteres Mecca

</p><p align="justify">Scarcely had The Prophet Mohammad (s) gone when his uncle Hamzah came in sight
from the opposite direction on his way from a long chase, with his bow
slung over his shoulder. The friends of Abu Jahal, who were at the Santuray
square saw Hamzah and feared the consquense of him hearing of what Abu
Jahal had done against his nephew. So they all cried out nervousily
announcing that this formidable Arabian horseman was indeed approaching
Mecca, and they sent someone to warn Abu Jahal.

</p><p align="justify">"Hamzah, here comes Hamzah!"

</p><p align="justify">With a mixture of joy and apprehension the rest of the people ran out happy
</p><p align="justify">to greet him as he approached the Holy Kabah on his magnificient Arab stallion.

</p><p align="justify">It was his custom, whenever Hamzah came back from hunting, he would do
honour and homage to the Holy House before he joined his family. Seeing him
approach, a woman came out of her house near the Safa Gate and addressed
him. She was a freedwoman of the household of the now dead Abd Allah Ibin
Jud'an of Taym, and she herself, being well disposed to The
Prophet (s) and his religion of Islam, had been outraged by Abu
Jahal's insults, every word of which she had overheard.

</p><p align="justify">"Abu Umarah (Hamzah), if only thou hadst seen how Mohammad, thy Brother's son, was
treated even now by Abu al-Hakam, the son of Hisham. He found him sitting
here, and most odiously reviled him and abused him. Then he left him."

</p><p align="justify">She pointed towards the Mosque to indicate where he had gone

</p><p align="justify">"And Mohammad answered not a word."

</p><p align="justify">Hamzah was of a quiet friendly nature and had an easy disposition. He was
none the less the most stalwart man of Quraysh, and when roused he was the
most formidable and the most unyielding. His mighty tall frame now shook
with anger. Such as he had never felt, and his anger set free something in
his soul, and brought to completion an already formed resolve, that no one
had seen from him before that day.

</p><p align="justify">Hamzah confronts Abu Jahal

</p><p align="justify">Striding into the Mosque he made straight for the seated Abu Jahal; and
standing over him, he raised his bow and brought it down with all his force
on his face. Knocking the wicked man senseless over onto his back on the
ground. Again and again he whipped the wretched man on his body with his
bow, until his angre subsided. When finlly he stopped and still standing
over the crouched enemy of God at his feet, he said.

</p><p align="justify">"Wilt thou insult him, now that I am of his Religion, and now
that I vouch what he voucheth? I bear witness that their is no
god but Allah, and Mohammad is His Servant and Messenger! Strike
me then, blow for blow, if thou canst."

</p><p align="justify">The humilated Abu Jahal recovered his senses and cowered before the Lion of
the desert still standing meancingly over him. So when some of the
Makhzumites tribesmen present rose to their feet as if to help him, but he
quickly motioned them to remain seated. Then still crouched on the ground
at the Arabian warrior's feet, not daring to look up into Hamzah's striking
eyes. Instead the miserable coward humbly said:

</p><p align="justify">"Let Abu Umarah be! For by God, I did so reviled his Brother's son with a
right ugly reviling."

</p><p align="justify">Their was a deafening silence as Hamzah stood menacingly before all the
leaders of Quraysh starring with contempt at each one of them coldly in the
eye. Inviting anyone who dared to fight him. But each man slowly retreated
and sat back in their seat in the Mosque. And when all were seated, Hamza
kicked some dust of the sandy floor into their faces and strolled out
casually with his bow in hand.

</p><p align="justify">Abu Sufayan the most influencial of all the leaders of Quraysh seated remarked.

</p><p align="justify">"Mohammad now has a powerfull ally, who everyone fears just by reputation!"

</p><p align="justify">From that day, Hamzah faithfully maintained his Islam and followered all
The Prophet's (s) behests. Nor did his conversion fail to have its
effect upon Quraysh as a whole. Who were now more hesitant to harass The
Holy Prophet Moammad (s) so directly, knowing full well that Hamzah,
'the Lion of the Desert' would not lie still and certainly would protect
him vigorously.
