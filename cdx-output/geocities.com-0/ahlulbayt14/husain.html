<p><b>Some Ahadith of The Holy Prophet Muhammad (s) About Imam Husain</b>
</p><ul>
<li><p align="justify">They (Hasan and Husain) are my two sweet-smelling flowers in this world.<br>
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Al-Hasan and Al-Husain are the chiefs of the youth of Paradise and Fatimah is the chief of their women.<br>
</p></li><li><p align="justify">I am in war with those who will fight you (Ali, Hasan, Husain, and Fatimah), and in peace with those who are peaceful to you.<br>

</p></li><li><p align="justify">These (Hasan and Husain) are my sons and my daughter's sons. O' Allah, I love them, so I beseech Thee to love them and those who love them.

<p><b>Some Sayings of Imam Hussain</b>
</p><ul>
<li><p align="justify">My mission is to reform the muslim community which I propose to do by AMRAL BIL MA'ROOF AND NAHYA ANIL MUNKAR, inviting them to the good and advising them against evil. It is not my intention to set myself as an insolent or arrogant tyrant or a mischief maker.<br>
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Don't you see that the truth is not followed and the falsehood is not discouraged? (The situation is so severe) so that a Believer wishes to meet Allah (i.e., to die). And today I don't see death but prosperity, and living with tyrants is nothing but disgust and disgrace.<br>
</p></li><li><p align="justify">I revolted not for wickedness nor for fame. Verily I rose only to seek for rectification in the nation of my grandfather, The Messenger of Allah.<br>
</p></li><li><p align="justify">An Imam is one who judges by the Holy Quran, upholds justice, professes the religion of truth and dedicates himself to obeying Allah and His Prophet.<br>
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Are you threatening me with death? Death is many thousands of times better than the dishonour of Bai'at to an enemy of Islam. Do you not see that truth is not being practised and falsehood is not being prevented? I see death as a blessing and life with tyrants as the most disgusting state one can be in.<br>
</p></li><li><p align="justify">By Allah, I shall not give my oath to you like a humiliated one, and nor shall I flee like the captive.<br>
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Remember that when you see a ruler who does what has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, who indulges in sins, who oppresses the people he rules, and you do nothing to stop such a ruler, before Allah you are as guilty as he is.<br>
</p></li><li><p align="justify">My parents did not raise me to submit myself to an evil tyrant. I am your Imam and it is my duty to tell you that you have surrendered the freedom of your mind to the evil ways of Yazeed. If you do not care for Islam, and do not fear the day of judgement, at least do care for that precious gift from Allah, the freedom of your spirit.<br>
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Death is better that disgrace and disgrace is better than the fire of hell.<br>
</p></li><li><p align="justify">If you do not have any religion, then at least be free (open-minded) in your present life.<br>
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The true life is all having a strong idea and striving (for that idea).<br>
</p></li><li><p align="justify">People are the slaves of this world, and religion is just in their tong. They keep it as long as it meets their comfortable life. But when the test comes, religion holders become very few.

<p><b>What They Said About Imam Husain ?</b>
</p><p></p><li><b> Muhammad Iqbal (from Lahore, Pakistan)</b>
<p align="justify">Imam Husain uprooted despotism forever till the day of Judgment. He watered the dry garden of freedom with surging wave of his blood, and indeed he awakened the sleeping Muslim nation. If Imam Husain had aimed at acquiring a worldly empire, he would not have traveled he did. Husain weltered in blood and dust for the sake of truth. Verily he, therefore, became bed-rock (foundation) of the Muslim creed; There is no God but Allah.
</p><p></p></li><li><b> Jonah Winters</b>
<p align="justify">The martyrdom of Husayn, the Prophet's last living male descendent, is more momentous than a mere expression of injustice. It is an historical event similar in significance to the crucifixion of Jesus, one in which God's appointed leader has been martyred by the forces of oppression and evil. The injustice of this is too great, to heinous, to be regarded as anything but a part of God's plan. Thus, the martyrdoms of Husayn and Jesus are seen as intentional and, even, voluntary; though God did not wish for Husayn to be murdered, it was nonetheless foreordained. The martyrdom of Husayn parallels that of Christ in another major respect: it is the channel through which humans can attain divine sanctification. 
</p><p></p></li><li><b> Charles Dickens</b>
<p align="justify">If Husain fought to quench his worldly desires, (as alleged by certain Christian critics) then I do not understand why his sisters, wives and children accompanied him. It stands to reason therefore that he sacrificed purely for Islam."
</p><p></p></li><li><b> Thomas Carlyle (Hero and Hero-worship)</b>
<p align="justify">The best lesson which we get from the tragedy of Karbala is that Husain and his followers were the rigid believers of God, they illustrated that numerical superiority does not count when it comes to truth and falsehood. The victory of Husain despite his minority marvels me.
</p><p></p></li><li><b> Dr. K. Sheldrake</b>
<p align="justify">Husain marched with his little company not to glory, not to power or wealth, but to a supreme sacrifice and every member of that gallant band, male and female, knew that the foes were implacable, were not only ready to fight but to kill. Denied even water for the children, they remained parched under a burning sun, amid scorching sands yet no one faltered for a moment and bravely faced the greatest odds without flinching.
</p><p></p></li><li><b> E.G. Browne (A Literary History of Persia)</b>
<p align="justify">A reminder of the blood-stained field of Karbala, where the grandson of the Apostle of God fell at length tortured by thirst and surrounded by the bodies of his murdered kinsmen, has been at anytime since then sufficient to evoke, even in the most lukewarm and heedless, the deepest emotions, the most frantic grief and an exaltation of spirit before which pain, danger and death shrink to unconsidered trifles."
</p><p></p></li><li><b> Edward Gibbon (Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire)</b>
<p align="justify">In a distant age and clime the tragic scene of the death of Husain will awaken the sympathy of the coldest reader." "In the history of Islam, especially the life of Imam Husain stand unique, unapproached and unapproachable by anyone. Without his martyrdom, Islam would have extinguished long ago. He was the saviour of Islam and it was due to his martyrdom that Islam took such a deep root, which it is neither possible nor even imaginable to destroy now.
</p><p></p></li><li><b> Washington Irving</b>
<p align="justify">It was possible for Husain to save his life by submitting himself to the will of Yazid. But his responsibility as a reformer did not allow him to accept Yazid's Caliphate. He therefore prepared to embrace all sorts of discomfort and inconvenience in order to deliver Islam from the hands of the Omayyads. Under the blazing sun, on the parched land and against the stifling heat of Arabia, stood the immortal Husain.
