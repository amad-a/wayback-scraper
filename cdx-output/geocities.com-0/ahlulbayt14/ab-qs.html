Ahlul-Bayt  in the Quran and the Prophet's Traditions (sunnah)
<hr width="80%">

<p align="JUSTIFY"> The Quran emphasizes the lofty position

and significance of the Ahlul-Bayt so as to make

mankind follow their right path, consult them when their

opinion differs or their faith, situation and concepts

contradict.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Investigating the verse of Revelation, we will

find that the Quran sometimes addresses them as 'Ahlul-Bayt',

like the Almighty's saying:

</p><p align="justify">"..Allah desires only to keep away uncleanness from you 

O people of the House (Ahlul-Bayt) and make you as pure as can be." Holy Quran (33:33) 
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Sometimes as 'relative' (Qurba) like His saying:

</p><p align="justify">"...Say (O' Muhammad unto

mankind): I do not ask of you any reward for it 

(preaching the message)' but love for my relatives

(Ahlul-Bayt)..." Holy Quran (42:23) 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The Holy Quran, also, focuses on their merits and

their virtues through various verses without using these

two terms for indicating them like its address concerning

Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husein in Chapter (Dahr)

and the Mubahala verse or its description of Ali

in many verses like the Wilaya and Tabligh

verses and other verses. It describes them as being the

best among mankind, the pious and...etc.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The commentators and narrators single out the

causes for the revelation of these verses and acknowledge

what is meant by them, then it will be cleared for us

through some samples of the interpretation of the

Almighty's verses and explain the causes for their revelation:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">1. The Verse of Purity (Tathir):

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"..Allah desires only to keep away

uncleanness from you O people of the House (Ahlul-Bayt) 

and make you as pure as can be." Holy Quran (33:33) 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">All exegists of the Holy Quran and narrators

of the Prophet's traditions, unanimously agree that the

word Ahlul-Bayt, or the Household of the Prophet

(s) as used by Almighty Allah in the Quran, refers

only to the following persons: The Prophet's daughter

Fatima, her husband Ali and their two children Hasan and

Husein (peace be upon them all). The famous exegist

Suyuti in his renowned commentary 'Dur al-Manthur'

cites Tabarani's narration from Umm Salama that the

Messenger of Allah (s) once told his beloved

daughter, Fatima, to call her husband Ali and two of

their sons; Hasan and Husein. When they came, the

Messenger of Allah (s) covered them with a Fadak

(a place near Madina) cloak and put his hand on them, and said:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"O Allah! these are the Ahl Muhammad

(another version says aal (family) Muhammad, 

so, shower your blessings and favours on aal Muhammad

as you showered them on aal Abraham; 

You are the Praiseworthy, the Glorious."

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Umm Salama said that she raised the cloak to

join them, but the Prophet pulled it out of her hand and

said: "You are (also) on the right."
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">On many occasions Prophet Muhammad (s)

explained the meaning of this verse (of purity) to the

Muslims and drew their attention to its significance in

order to be enlightened with them (Ahlul-Bayt) by

following their straight path. Once, it happened that the

Prophet while passing his daughter Fatima's  house

on his way to the mosque for the (lawn prayers, used to call:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"To prayer, O Ahlul-Bayt, to prayer; Allah

desires to keep away uncleanness from you, 

people of the House and make you pure as pure as can be."
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Anas bin Malik narrated that the Prophet (s) used

to go to Fatima's house for six months whenever he went

out for prayer. He used to say: "To prayer, O

Ahlul-Bayt, to prayer; Allah desires to keep a way

uncleanness from you, people of the House and make you

pure as pure as can be."
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">2. The Verse of Affection (Mawadah):

</p><p align="justify">"...Say (O' Muhammad unto

mankind): I do not ask of you any reward 

for it (preaching the message), but love for my relatives (Ahlul-Bayt)..." Holy Quran (42:23) 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The Messenger of Allah (s) explicitly told

the Muslims that this blessed verse refers to his Ahlul-Bayt,

that is; Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husein and urged them to

obey and follow these illustrious personalities after him.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">All commentators, traditionists and biographers

said that the word 'near relatives of the Prophet' as

used, here, refers exclusively to his Ahlul-Bayt

that is Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husein.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Fakhruddin Razi, while explaining this verse,

says: "...and without doubt no one was so near to

the Prophet than Fatima, Ali, Hasan and Husein. This is a

well-known fact of all chains of narrations, and these

are they who are his 'aal'".

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Thus, it is an undisputed fact that the words Ahlul-Bayt

or aal Muhammad (s) refer only to the

immediate family of the Prophet; his daughter Fatima,

son-in-law Ali and his two sons Hasan and Husein and no one else.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">First: We have already cited some instances of

the Prophet's love for his family.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Second: No doubt being his only surviving

child, Fatima was intensely loved by her father. The

Prophet's famous words are a testimony to this fact.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"Fatima is a part of me and whoever makes

her angry, makes me angry."

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The traditions also confirm this and also his

natural inclination towards Ali and his grandchildren,

Hasan and Husein. Therefore, it becomes a duty for the

Prophet's nation to follow the Prophet's traditions in

respect to his Ahlul-Bayt. The Almighty says: 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"...Say (O Muhammad say unto mankind) if

you love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love

you..." Holy Quran (3:31)

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> 3. The Verse of Malediction (Mubahala):

</p><p align="justify">"But whoever disputes with

you (O' Muhammad) in this matter after what has come 

to you of knowledge then say: Come, let us call our sons

and your sons and our women 

and your women and our selves and your selves, then let

us beseech Allah and invoke His curse upon the liars." Holy Quran (3:61) 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">This verse points towards an epoch-making

event, narrated by all historians and commentators; an

event which revealed to the Muslims the status of the

family of the Prophet (Ahlul-Bayt)  (Ali,

Fatima, Hasan and Husein), and how near and dear they are to Allah, the Exalted. 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">It is narrated that a deputation<font size="4">*</font>

from the Christians of Najran came to the Prophet of

Islam to argue the merits of their faith and also to

discuss with him concerning his prophethood. The Holy

Prophet advanced to them arguments showing that Jesus,

the son Mary, was a human being and a Prophet, and it was

blasphemy to regard him as a son of Allah, because Allah,

the Exalted, is high above all such human

characteristics. It was when the Prophet, having argued

the point fully and convincingly, found them still

deliberately persisting in their false belief in the

deity of Prophet Jesus, that Allah revealed this verse.

It was a challenge to the Christians, to pray and invoke

Allah that the curse may overtake the party that insisted

upon falsehood.<br>
__________________<br>
*-The deputation was comprised of three prominant

Christian leaders of Arabia, Abdul-Masih, the political

leader; al-Ayham in-charge of their Agro-Pastoral

affairs; and Abu Hatam ibn Alqama, who was a Bishop or Pontiff.<br>
__________________<br>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Early the next morning on the 24th of the lunar

month of Dhilhijja, the Prophet, in accordance

with Allah's command, came out to the meeting grounds,

carrying Husein in his arms and leading Hasan "our

sons" by his hand, followed by his beloved daughter

Fatima "our women", behind whom came Ali

"our selves" carrying the banner of Islam.

Seeing the Prophet was accompanied by his immediate

family and convinced that Muhammad (s) was truthful,

otherwise he would not have dared to bring his dearest of

kin along, the Christians backed away from the

maledictory confrontation and agreed to pay Jizya  instead.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Zamakhshari says in his book 'al-Kashshaf':

That (when this verse was revealed) the Prophet asked the

Christians to a Mubahala (malediction) to invoke

the curse of Allah on the liars. The Christians held a

discourse among themselves that night, in which their

leader Abdul Massih stated his views as follows. "By

God, O Christians, you know that Muhammad is a God-sent

Prophet, who has brought to you the final message from

your Lord. By God, no nation ever dared to challenge a

Prophet with malediction, but that woe befell them. Not

only will they perish, but, their children will also be

afflicted with the curse." Saying this, that it is

better to reach a compromise with the Prophet, rather

than challenge his truth and perish Abdul Massih advised

his party to stop hostilities and retain their religion

by submitting to the Prophet's terms. "So, if you

persist (for a confrontation), we will all perish. But,

if you, to keep your faith, should refuse (to have a

showdown) and remain as you are, then, make peace with

the man (the Prophet) and return to your land." 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Zamakhshari continues: "The next day the

Prophet, carrying Husein in his arms, leading Hasan by

the hand; followed by his daughter Fatima, behind whom

came Ali, entered the appointed place and was heard

saying (to his Ahlul-Bayt):

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"When I invoke Allah, you all say: Amen."

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The pontiff of Najran on seeing the Prophet and

his Ahlul-Bayt, addressed the Christians:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"O' Christians, I am beholding such faces

that if God wishes (for their sake), 

He would move mountains from their places. Do not

accept their challenge 

for Mubahala for if you do you would all perish and

there would remain no 

Christian on the face of the earth till the Day of

Resurrection." Heeding his advice the Christians

said to the Prophet: "O Abdul Qasim, we decided

not to hold Mubahala with you. You keep your religion

and we will keep ours."

  The Prophet told them:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"If you refuse to hold (Mubahala), then submit, (accept Islam) 

and you will receive what the Muslims receive, and contribute 

what the Muslims contribute."

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">

The Christians saying they had no desire to fight

the Arabs, proposed a treaty asking for peace, and freed

from forced compulsion to make them forsake their

religion. In return they agreed to pay the Muslims an

annual tribute of two thousands suits; one thousand of

which to be paid in the month of Safar and the

remaining one thousand in Rajab, besides thirty coats of iron mail.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Accepting the proposal the Prophet remarked:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"By the One Who has my soul in His hand

death was looming large over the people of Najran.

(Had they dared to accept the challenge of 'Mubahala'). They would have been transformed into

apes and swines, and the valley would have been set

ablaze. Allah would have destroyed Najran with its

people, sparing not even the birds on the treetops,

and before the passing of the year the Christians

would have all been dead."

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Continuing his comments on the Mubahala

verse, Zamakhshari lays emphasis on the position of the Ahlul-Bayt

by quoting the following narration from the Prophet's

wife Aa'isha:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"He mentioned them, Ahlul-Bayt, before

mentioning the word 'selves' in order to highlight

their position and their proximity (to Allah), and to

stress their preference to 'selves' which could be

sacrificed for them. There is no stronger evidence

than this regarding the merits of the Ahl al-Kesaa<font size="4">*</font>. It is the proof of the

truthfulness of the Prophet's mission, because no one

however biased, has narrated that they (the

Christians) dared to accept that (challenge for

Mubahala)".
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Surely this status of the Ahlul-Bayt

indicates the appearance of the camp of belief

(represented by the Prophet (s) and his holy family (Ahlul-Bayt))

against the camp of idolatory and disbelief, because<br>
__________________<br>
*-Ahl al-Kesaa is a term denoting those who gathered

with the Prophet under the Kesaa (cloak) whereupon the

verse of purity was revealed. They are All, Fatima,

Hasan, Husein, as has been already discussed, earlier.<br>
__________________<br>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">those who came out to the meeting grounds were the

best examples of guidance and the leaders of the nation

and the purist among the selves whom Allah kept

uncleanness away from them and made them pure as pure as

can be. Therefore, we understand that whatever we receive

from the Household of the Prophet (Ahlul-Bayt)

 of their thoughts, laws, narrations,

jurisprudence, interpretations, and guidance comes from

this course and that they are truthful in their

utterances, biography and path.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The Quran challenges the enemies of Islam by them and

calls their enemies liars and says that they should be

faced with curse and punishment. The Almighty says:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"...then let us beseech Allah and in

yoke His curse upon ,he liars." Holy Quran (3:61) 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Without their (Ahlul-Bayt) truthfulness

and righteousness, Allah would not give them such status

and position nor would the Quran have uttered anything

concerning them.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Fakhruddin Razi, in his 'al-Tafsiral-Kabir',

gives an identical narration and after having stated what

Zamakhshari has said; adds: 'Mind you, that all

interpreters (of the Quran) and narrators (of the

Prophet's traditions) are unanimous about the

authenticity of this narration." 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">But by taking along only these four and no one

else besides, the Messenger of Allah (s) was showing

the Muslims, that the best example for women is Fatima

and the best example for boys are Hasan and Husein,

according to the Quran's wordings, which, also,

delicately used the word 'our selves' for Ali, thereby

pointing to his close proximity with the Prophet, and

solving the question of succession once and for all.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">4. The Verse of Prayer (Salat):

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"Surely Allah and His angels bless the

Prophet; O you who believe! 

Call for (divine) blessings on him and salute him

with a (becoming) salutation." Holy Quran (33:56) 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The previous verses, of the Holy Quran,

revealed to us as to who are the Prophet's Ahlul-Bayt,

their purity of character and the command for Muslims to

love and obey them. This verse refers to the salutation salawat,

which a Muslim is obliged to send on the Prophet and his

progeny during the five daily prayers.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In this verse, the Muslims are ordered here to

send blessings on the Prophet and his "aal"

(progeny), a term exclusively reserved for Ali, Fatima,

Hasan and Husein and their righteous descendants. The

emphasis on the Prophet's "aal", in

salutation, is yet another indication of their pivotal

position after the Prophet. By asking the Muslims to

exalt them, Allah, the Exalted, was reminding the Muslim

communities that He had chosen the Ahlul-Bayt, for

the role of leading the Muslim nation.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In his 'Tafsir al-Kabir', Fakhruddin

Razi, commenting on the above verse, narrates the

following quotation from the Prophet, who was asked by

some of his companions on how to send blessings upon him.

The Prophet replied:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"Say: 'O Allah, send blessings on Muhammad

and on Muhammad's progeny as You sent blessings on

Abraham and on Abraham's progeny; and send grace on

Muhammad and on Muhammad's progeny, as You sent grace

on Abraham and on Abraham's progeny, You are the

Praiseworthy, the Glorious."'

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Before giving this narration, Razi interprets

the verse and comments: 'This is a proof of the Shafi'i

school, because order means an obligation;
so, to send blessings on the Prophet (s) is

obligatory, at least in the Tashahhud (testimony

during the prayers) if not elsewhere."<br>
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">

Razi further argues: 'If Allah and His angels send

their blessings on him (the Prophet), then what need is

there for our blessings?" He, himself, provides the

answer: 'When we send blessings on him, it is not because

he is in need of them, but, because of already having

Allah's blessings, he does not even require the blessings

of the angels. When we send, we send to glorify Allah,

and, also, it (sending blessings) reveals our gratitude

towards Allah, so that He may have compassion on us and

reward us. That is why the Prophet said;

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"Whoever sends blessings on me once, Allah

will send blessings on him ten times."

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">It will not be out of context, here, to cite

Imam Shafi'i's famous quatrain on this subject:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"O' Household of the Messenger of Allah,

love for you  Is an obligation from Allah, revealed in the Quran.

It suffices as the greatest honour bestowed on you 

That his prayer comes of nothing who does not salute

you."

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Suyuti, in his , Dur al-Manthur', citing

Abdul-Razzaq, Ibn Abi Shaiba, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Abd ibn

Hamid, Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi, Nisa'i, ibn

Maja, ibn Mardawaya, who have all narrated from Ka'b ibn

Ujra, says: a man once said to the Prophet that greeting

him is clear to everyone, but, how does one send

blessings on him. The Prophet replied:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"O Allah, send blessings on Muhammad and

on Muhammad's progeny as You sent blessings on

Abraham and on Abraham's progeny, You are the

Praiseworthy, the Glorious."' 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Suyuti has cited eighteen different narrations

other than this, with slight variations, stressing that

the blessings on the Prophet should include his progeny,

also. The same has been narrated by compilers of all "Sunan"

and "Jawami", books quoting a number of the

Prophet's companions, such as; Abdulla ibn Abbas, Talha,

Abu Sa'id Khidri, Abu Huraira, Abu Mas'ud Ansari,

Buraida, ibn Mas'ud, Ka'b ibn Amra, and last, but not the

least, Ali ibn Abi Talib, himself. Similarly, it has been

narrated byAhmad ibn Hanbal and Tirmidhi who have quoted

Imam Hasan ibn Ali from the Prophet as follows:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"He is a miser who, on the mention of my

name to him, does not send blessings on me."(6)

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Thus, all jurisprudents agree that it is

obligatory for Muslims to send blessings on Muhammad

(s) and his progeny during the Tashahud

(Testimony) in the five daily prayers.(7)

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">By analyzing this verse we easily discover the

real objective behind this obligatory command; which is

to revere Muhammad's (s) pure progeny, from whom

Allah has kept away all uncleanness and error, and made

them pure as pure can be. The emphasis on his "aal"

by the Prophet, is yet another indication to the Muslims

of their pivotal position after him. By commanding

Muslims, to send their blessings on them, Allah, the

Exalted, was reminding Muslims of the Ahlul-Bayt's

eventual leadership. In other words, by taking them as

exemplars and accepting their leadership, the Muslims

would be spared from trials and controversies.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">So, it is clear that Allah has not mentioned

them in the prayers for nought. Had it not been for their

probity that was proved time and again and for their

magnanimity of character, as well as, their deep

knowledge, Allah would not have ordered the Muslims to

adhere to their straight course and seek blessings for

them in every prayer. The very fact that this blessing

should be invoked every day in each prayer a Muslim

performs was but to draw the attention of the Muslim

communities towards the significance of the Ahlul-Bayt;

which should serve as a constant reminder that it is they

who are Muhammad's (s) rightful heirs. Or to put it

more clearly, anyone ignoring their status deliberately

or otherwise, has no excuses, whatsover, and is deceiving

his own self to be astray from Allah's command.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> 5. The Verse of Feeding:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"The righteous truly drink of a cup

tempered with camphor - A fountain from which the

servants of Allah drink, making it flow in abundance.

They fulfil vows and fear a day, the evil of which is

widespread. And they give food, out of love for Him,

to the poor and the orphan and the captive. We feed

you, for Allah's pleasure only - We desire from you

neither reward nor thanks. Surely we fear from our

Lord a stem, distressful day. So Allah will ward off

from them the evil of that day, and cause them to

meet with splendour and happiness; And reward them,

for their steadfastness, with a Garden and with

silk." Holy Quran (76:5-13)

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">These verses of the Holy Quran speak of the Ahlul-Bayt,

and places them at the top of preference and piety and

shows them as examplars and models for mankind so that

the generations are rightly guided through them and

follow their right way. The historical occasion to which

these blessed verses refer is the great status of Ahlul-Bayt

. When Ali, Fatima and their two sons Hasan and

Husein (peace be upon them all) fasted for three

consecutive days, and each day at the time of breaking

the fast some needy person, as verse number eight

indicates, appeared and the Ahlul-Bayt gladly fed

him, and themselves passed the nights without food. Allah

was so pleased by the generosity of the Prophet's

Household that He converted their actions into verses of

the Glorious Quran to serve as guidance for the Muslims.

These verses not only portray the Ahlul-Bayt's

total submission to Allah's Will, but, also, reveal them

as pure and spotless personalities; promised esteem and

admiration among the dwellers of Paradise. They are shown

as immaculate models of emulation so that whoever, among

the Muslim communities, follows their glowing path will

achieve salvation and will be assembled in their

illustrious company on the Resurrection Day. 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Zamakhshari, in his 'Kashshaf'

commenting on this verse, narrates from Abdullah bin

Abbas - that once Hasan and Husein fell sick and the

Prophet, together with some of his companions, visited

his sick grandsons. He suggested that Ali should make a

vow to Allah for his sons' health. Heeding the Prophet's

suggestion Ali, Fatima along with their maid, Fidha, took

a vow that if the boys recovered, they would fast for

three consecutive days. Eventually, Hasan and Husein

recovered and to fulfill the vow they also fasted along

with their parents and maid. Since there was nothing in

the house to eat, Ali borrowed from Sham'un, a Khaibarian

Jew, three measures of barely.

Fatima grounded one measure into flour and baked it into

five loaves (of bread) equal to their number, and placed

these before them for breaking the fast. Just then a

beggar stopped at their door and said: "al-Salaam

Alaikum (peace be upon you), O Ahlul-Bayt of

Muhammad (s), (I am) one of the poorest of Muslims

(so), feed me, may Allah feed you of the food of

Paradise!" So they gladly gave him all the food and

slept that night, tasting nothing but water." They

fasted again the next day and at sunset as they placed

the bread before them to break the fast, an orphan

knocked on the door asking for food and they cheerfully

fed him, themselves going without food for yet another

day. On the third day of the fast, as the breaking time

approached, and the food was spread, a prisoner (of war)

suddenly appeared at their door and the same scenario was

repeated, with the Prophet's Ahlul-Bayt passing

the third successive night without tasting a morsel of

food. Zamakhshari continues that when dawn broke Ali

holding the hands of Hasan and Husein came to the

Prophet's house. The Prophet seeing their pale

countenances and noting that they were trembling from

hunger, expressed dismay and at once accompanied them to

their house. On entering the house, he was shocked to see

the sight of his daughter Fatima, sitting hollow-eyed on

her prayer mat, her stomach sunk into her back. It was,

then, that the angel Gabriel came down with this verse,

saying:
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"O Muhammad, Allah congratulates you for

(the sacrifice of) your household. Then he recited

the (verse)."
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">6. The Verse of Guardianship (Wilaya):

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"Only Allah is your Guardian and His

Apostle and those who believe, those who keep up

prayers and pay the poor-rate while in (Ruku'). And

whoever takes Allah and His Apostle and those who

believe as his guardian, then surely the party of

Allah are they that shall be triumphant" Holy Quran (5:55-5)

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">There are other numerous verses which extoll

Imam Ali's  virtue, generosity, bravery, patience,

piety, his sacrificing in Allah's way and supporting

Allah's Apostle (s) and his being the most righteous

among the believers and the best among His

creatures...etc. The above-mentioned verses from the Book

of Allah are as examples:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Zamakhshari, in his 'al-Kashshaf', says

the following about this verse:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"It was revealed in favour of Ali (May

Allah enlighten his face) when a beggar asked him (for

alms) while he was in the position of Ruku' during

prayer, and he gave away his ring (in the same position).

It seems it was loose on his little finger, for he did

not exert any effort in taking it off, which would have

nullified his prayer. If you ask: 'How could it be in

favour of Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), when the

wordings are in the collective form?' I say. The form is

collective, though its instigator is a single man,

because this is to encourage people to follow his example

and earn a similar reward, and, also, to draw attention

to the fact that the believers must be extremely mindful

and benevolent, towards the poor, in as much as, if a

situation could not be postponed until after the prayer,

it may not he delayed till having finished it."
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Wahidi, in 'Asbab al-Nuzul', citing

Kalbi's narration concerning the cause for the revelation

of this verse says:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"Surely Allah is your Guardian and His

Apostle and those who believe, those who keep up

prayers and pay the poor-rate while in prostration

(Ruku')." 

"The latter part of this verse is in favour

of Ali bin Abi Talib (may Allah be gracious to him)

because he gave a ring to a beggar while in Ruku'

during prayer."
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">7 . The Verse of Proclamation (Tabligh):
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"O Prophet proclaim what has been

revealed to you from your Lord, for if you do it not

you have not conveyed His message, and Allah will

protect you from the (evil designs of)

people..." Holy Quran (5:67)

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the most clear portent of Imam Ali's

excellence over the Muslims after the Prophet, is the

above verse, which makes a decisive phase in the history

of divine revelation. After creating this wide and

wonderful world, the Almighty had sent an unbroken chain

of prophets to guide mankind towards divine bliss. The

last and the greatest link in this eternal chain was

Muhammad al-Mustafa (s), who was entrusted

with the most comprehensive code of laws, capable of

solving mankind's needs till doomsday. Now, there no

longer was need of any new messenger. But nonetheless,

the Wise Creator cannot leave mankind's struggle of

thousands of years to the whims and fancies of fallible

Arabs, who had spent the greater part of their lives in

idolatary and sin. Therefore, to ensure the safety of

Islam and Muslims, Allah sent down this verse, appointing

Imam Ali as the Prophet's vicegerent. Narrators and

historians have testified to that great event.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">When the Messenger of Allah left Mecca after

the Hajj ceremonies all the Muslims followed him,

with the intention of leaving him at a place near Juhfa

which was at the crossroads for the caravans of Madinah,

Egypt and Syria. On the 18th Dhilhijja, a

little before noon, when they reached Ghadir Khum

near Juhfa, he stopped and ordered all the people ahead

to come near and wait for those following ... When all

the caravan had gathered, he called for a congregational

prayer, and, then, he offered midday prayers in the

midday heat, then he stood up addressing the people,

and started his speech by praising and giving thanks to

Him. Then he said:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"O people! I am about to be called to

Allah, and depart to Him. I am responsible and so are

you. What do you say?"

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"We bear witness that you have delivered

the Divine Message, and tried your best to guide us on

the right path, and always gave us good counsel. May

Allah bless you with a good reward," they replied.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The Prophet proceeded: 'Don't you,' he said,

'bear witness that there is no god but Allah, Muhammad is

His servant and Messenger, His paradise is true, His hell

is true?'

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"O Yes! We bear witness to all this," they said,

"O Allah! Bear witness," he said.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Then he said: "Do not you hear?"

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">They replied, "Yes."

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Then he went on saying:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">'O people! I will precede you and you shall

arrive at the pool (Kawther): the pool wider than the

distance between Basrah and San'a and which has two

goblets of silver as large as the space in which the stars are swimming.

When you shall reach me I shall interrogate you about

your behaviour towards the two weighty things after

my death. Then a caller called: 'mat are the two

weighty things, O Allah's Messenger?' He (s)

said: The weightier one is the Book of Allah, the

Mighty and Glorified, which has two bonds, one is in

the hands of Allah, the Most High, and the other in

your hands. So hold tight to it, don't go astray and

don't change your faith. The other mighty thing is my

progeny, my household. The Knower of subtleties, the

Aware has told me that they will join me at the pool

as soon as their life on earth expires."
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Then, he (s) said:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"Don't you know that I am more appropriate

for authority over the believers than

themselves?" 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"Yes, O the Messenger of Allah"
they answered. He (s) said:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"Don't you know or witness that I am more

appropriate for authority over every believer than

himself?" 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"Yes, O Messenger of Allah", they replied.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Then, he (s) bent down and lifting up Ali bin Abi

Talib  in his hands, showed him to the vast crowd

who looked on his armpits's whiteness(19) and proclaimed

those famous words, which guaranteed the continuation of divine leadership:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"O people! Allah is my Master and I am

your master. for whomseover I am master, this,

Ali, is his master O Allah! Befriend whoever

befriends him and be hostile to whoever is hostile to

him. help him who helps him, forsake him who

forsakes him, and love him who loves him and hate him who hates him."

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Then, he (s) said:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"O Allah! Bear witness."

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Then, they (the Messenger of Allah and Ali) did

not separate until the following verses were revealed:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"...today have I perfected unto you

your religion and completed upon you My blessings and

approved for you Islam as your religion..." Holy Quran (5:3) 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">There are numerous other verses in the book of

Allah, which elucidate the position, dignity and honour

of Imam Ali; his high status among the Muslims and he

is the best after the Messenger of Allah (s).

The following verse certifies this more:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"(As for) those who believe and do

good, surely they are the best of people." Holy Quran (98:7) 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">All the interpreters and narrators have

testified that the above-mentioned verse was revealed in

favour of Ali bin Abi Talib and Allah, the Almighty,

Himself, described him as the best of people. On the

revelation of this verse, the Messenger of Allah (s)

said:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"O Ali, these are you and your

followers."
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Whoever goes through the traditions of the

Prophet, his daily behaviour, and his relation with his Ahlul-Bayt,

whose purity the Holy Quran, itself, has testified to,

one realizes that Ahlul-Bayt (Ali, Fatima, and

their two sons, Hasan and Husein) had a unique role and a

great responsibility in the history of the Muslim Nation.

So, the Prophet's frequent stress on these four

luminaries was not without meaning, nor was it mere

emotional behaviour towards his family.

In fact, he was only obeying Allah's commands to prepare

and guide the Muslims towards acceptance of their

leadership, after his eventual departure.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Only Suyuti collected about sixty Prophetic

traditions (hadiths) stressing the love towards

the Ahlul-Bayt ; acknowledge their

leadership so as to make the Muslim Nation follow their

perfect example and illuminated path; look for guidance

towards them and not in blind obedience, but, by a way of

discerning comparison with others.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The first step which the Prophet took towards

the formal building of this blessed family was the

marriage of his daughter, Fatima,  to his beloved

cousin Ali bin Abi Talib  at the Almighty's

command. Thus, became implemented this blessed 'tree'

which would eventually extend its shady branches over the

Muslims and its historical progress. It is narrated that

the Prophet (s) said: "Allah has ordered me

to marry Fatima to you."
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">When this marriage had occured, the blessed

family was formed and the two sons (Hasan and Husein)

were born, the Prophet used to caress them, saying:

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"All sons are their fathers' as their

agnation returns to their fathers, except the sons of

Fatima, as I am their father and agnation."
(Narrated by Ahmad bin Hanbal in 'al-Manaqib').
