<p align="justify">Many Sunni scholars have denied the existence of Abdullah Ibn Saba and/or the forged stories attributed to him. Among them are:
</p><p></p><hr noshade="" width="80%">
<p>Dr.  Taha  Husayn,  a  well-known Egyptian  Sunni  scholar.
<br>In his book al-Fitnat al-Kubra, Vol. II, p.90
<br>He wrote that:
</p><p align="justify">"The fact  that the historians make no  mention of Ibn al-Sawda' i.e., 'Abdullah ibn
Saba' being  present at the battle of  Siffin together with his followers proves at
the very least that  the whole notion of a group of people led by him is a baseless
fabrication. It is one of those inventions that acquired currency when the conflict
between  the Shi'is  and other  Islamic groups  intensified. In  order to underline
their hostility,  the enemies of the  Shi'ah tried to insert  a Jewish element into
the origins  of their  sect. If the  story of 'Abdullah  ibn Saba'  had any basis in
historical fact, his cunning  and guile could not have failed to show itself at the
battle of Siffin.
</p><p align="justify">"I can think of  only one reason for his name not occurring in connection with that
battle: that he was an entirely fictitious person, dreamed up by the enemies of the
Shi'ah in order to vilify them." 
</p><p>Dr. Taha Husain, who has analyzed these stories and rejected them.
<br>In his book "al-Fitnah al-Kubra"
<br>He wrote that:
</p><p align="justify">In my opinion, those who have tried to emphasize on the story of
Abdullah Ibn Saba, have committed a crime in the history and hurt
themselves too. The first thing that is observed is that in the
important collections the name of Ibn Saba does not appear when they
discuss the agitation against Uthman. Ibn Sa'd does not mention the
name of Abdullah Ibn Saba when he discusses the Caliphate of Uthman
and the revolt against him. Also the book by al-Baladhuri, "Ansab al-
Ashraf", which I think the most important and the most detailed book
about the revolt against Uthman, the name of Abdullah Ibn Saba has
never been mentioned. It appears that al-Tabari was the first who
reported the story of Ibn Saba from Sayf, and then other historians
quoted al-Tabari in this regard.
</p><p align="justify">Dr. Taha Husain
<br>In his  book "Ali wa Banuh" (Ali and His Sons)
<br>He mentioned:
</p><p align="justify">The story of Ibn Saba is nothing but myth, and is the invention of
some historians, since it contradicts other historical documents. 
The fact is that the friction between Shia and Sunni have had many
shapes, and each group was advocating itself and denouncing the other
by any means possible. This requires a historian to be much more
cautious when analyzing the controversial reports related to seditions and revolts.
</p><p></p><hr noshade="" width="80%">
<p>Dr.  Ali al-Wardi,  professor of history  at Baghdad University, Sunni  scholar
<br>Cited in Dr. Haykal, Hayat Muhammad, p. 136
<br>He wrote:
</p><p align="justify">"Did Ibn  Saba' actually  exist or was  he an imaginary  personality? For those who
wish to  study the  social history of  Islam and draw  the appropriate conclusions,
this  is an  extremely important  question. It  is claimed  that Ibn  Saba' incited
unrest,  but no  such person ever  existed. The whole  story is  reminiscent of the
claim  made by  the Quraysh at  the beginning of  the Prophet's  mission, peace and
blessings  be upon  him  and his  family,  that he  received his  teachings  from a
Christian slave  by the name of Jabr and  based his preaching on the instruction he
received from him."
</p><p></p><hr noshade="" width="80%">
<p>Muhammad Kurd Ali, Sunni scholar
<br> In his book Khitat al-Sham, Vol. VI, p. 246
<br>He wrote:
</p><p align="justify">"Some of the well-known  Companions who at the dawn of Islam followed Ali, peace be
upon him, became known  as the Shi'ah. What can be deduced from the written sources
is that certain shortsighted people regarded Shi'ism as a collection of innovations
and  fabrications stitched  together by  a person  known Abdullah  ibn Saba'  or Ibn
al-Sawda'.  However,  there can  be  no  doubt that  this  view of  things  is pure
superstition and  fantasy, for  this Abdullah ibn  Saba' the Jew  exists only in the
world of the imagination. Any attempt to link the origins of Shi'ism to him must be
regarded as a sign of pure ignorance."
</p><p></p><hr noshade="" width="80%">
<p align="justify">The research of Allamah al-Askari [Ibn Saba and Other Myths]
which was released in 1955. Before that time, no analytical research had
been done on the character of Abdullah Ibn Saba to investigate if he really
existed in physical world and/or if the stories around this man had any
single truth in it. Although Sayf's heresy was well-known for a number of
centuries, no research had been done about the origin of the tale of
Abdullah Ibn Saba. In his research, al-Askari proved that Sayf's narration
attributed to Abdullah Ibn Saba and many other things are sheer lie since
they contradict ALL other Sunni documents in content, timing of the events,
names of cities and companions, imaginary chain of narrators, and
miraculous records by Sayf (like talking cows with humans and so on). If
there was any Abdullah Ibn Saba at that time, his story was much different
than what Sayf manipulated.
</p><p align="justify">Here is the response of a Sunni scholar Dr. Hamid Dawud, the professor
of Cairo University, after reading al-Askari's book [Ibn Saba and Other Myths]
(Here is only a part of his letter):
</p><p align="justify">The 1300th birthday of Islam has been celebrated. During this time,
some of our learned writers have accused Shia of having un-Islamic
views. Those writers influenced public opinion against Shia and
created big gaps between Muslims. In spite of wisdom and learning, the
enemies of Shia followed their own chosen beliefs and partiality,
covering the truth, and accusing the Shia of being superstitious etc.
Hence Islamic science suffered much, as Shia views were suppressed.
</p><p align="justify">As a result of these accusations, the loss to Islamic science was
greater than the loss suffered by Shia themselves, because the source
of this jurisprudence, though rich and fruitful, was neglected,
resulting in limited knowledge. Also, in the past, our learned men
were prejudiced, otherwise we would have benefited from many Shia
views. Anyone who wishes to do research in Islamic Jurisprudence must
consider Shia sources as well as those of Sunni.
</p><p align="justify">Was not the Shia leader, Imam Jafar al-Sadiq (d. 148 AH), the teacher
of two Sunni Imams? i.e., Abu Hanifa al-Nu'man (d. 150 AH), and Malik
Ibn Anas (d. 179 AH).  Imam Abu Hanifa said: "Except for the two years
Nu'man would have starved," referring to the two years he had
benefited from the knowledge of Imam Jafar al-Sadiq. Imam Malik also
confessed straightforwardly that he had not met anyone learned in
Islamic Jurisprudence better than Imam Jafar al-Sadiq.
</p><p align="justify">Yet, some of our so-called learned men, unfortunately disregard the
rules for research to suit their own ends. Hence knowledge is not
fully disclosed to them and thus they create a wider gap between
Muslims. Ahmed Amin is one of those deprived of the light of
knowledge, remaining in darkness. History has recorded this stain on
the robe of Ahmed Amin and his friends, who blindly followed one
special Madhab. Of many mistakes made by him, the biggest is told in
the story of Abdullah Ibn Saba. This is one of the tales told in order
to accuse Shia of heresy and foregoing events.
</p><p align="justify">The great contemporary researcher, al-Askari, in his book, has proved
with substantial evidence, that Abdullah Ibn Saba was fictitious, and
it is therefore a greater lie to say that he was the founder of Shi'ism.
</p><p align="justify">God has decreed that some learned men disclose the truth regardless of
blame they may get. The pioneer in this subject is this man who has
made the Sunni learned men of research revise the history book of
Tabari (History of Nations and Kings), and to sift out the authentic
stories from the false. The stories which have been preserved as God's revelations.
</p><p align="justify">The honorable writer, with much evidence, has stripped the veil or
ambiguity from those historical events, and disclosed the truth, to
some extent that some facts seem frightful. But we have to obey the
truth no matter how difficult they appear. The truth is the best to be followed.
