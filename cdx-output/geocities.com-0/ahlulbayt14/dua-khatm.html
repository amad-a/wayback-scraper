<p align="center">
In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful

</p><p align="justify">
O Allah! Thou hast helped me complete Thy Book, which Thou sent down as a light and appointed
as a guardian over every book Thou hast sent down, preferring it over every narrative
which Thou hast recounted, a separator, through which Thou hast separated Thy lawful from
Thy unlawful, a Qur'an, through which Thou hast made plain the approaches to Thy
ordinances, a book, which Thou hast distinguished very distinctly for Thy servants, a
revelation, which Thou hast sent down, a sending down, upon Thy Prophet Muhammad (Thy
blessings be upon him and his Ahlul-Bayt). Thou appointed it a light through following
which we may be guided from the shadows of error and ignorance, a healing for him who
turns ear toward hearing it with the understanding of attestation, a just balance whose
tongue does not incline away from truth, a light of guidance whose proof is not
extinguished before the witnesses, and a guidepost of deliverance, so that he who repairs
straightway to its prescription will not go astray and he who clings to its preservation's
handhold will not be touched by the hands of disasters. </p><p align="justify">O Allah, since Thou hast given us
help to recite it and made smooth the roughness of our tongues through the beauty of its
expression, place us among those who observe it as it should be observed, serve Thee by
adhering in submission to the firm text of its verses, and seek refuge in admitting both
its ambiguous parts and the elucidations of its clear signs! </p><p align="justify">O Allah,Thou sent it down upon
Thy Prophet Muhammad (Allah bless him and his Ahlul-Bayt) in summary form,Thou inspired him
with the science of its wonders to complement it, Thou made us the heirs of its knowledge
as interpreters, Thou made us to surpass him who is ignorant of its knowledge, and Thou
gave us strength over it to raise us above those not able to carry it. </p><p align="justify">O Allah, just as Thou
hast appointed our hearts as its carriers and made known to us through Thy mercy its
nobility and excellence, so also bless Muhammad, its preacher, and his Ahlul-Bayt, its
guardians, and place us among those who confess that it has come from Thee, lest doubt
about attesting to it assail us, or deviation from its straightforward path shake us!
</p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and his Ahlul-Bayt and make us one of those who hold fast to its cord,
seek haven from its ambiguities in its fortified stronghold, rest in the shadow of its
wing, find guidance in the brightness of its morning, follow the shining of its
disclosure, acquire light from its lamp, and beg not guidance from any other! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, just
as through it Thou hast set up Muhammad as a guidepost to point to Thee and through his
Ahlul-Bayt Thou hast made clear Thy good pleasure's roads to Thee, so also bless Muhammad
and his Ahlul-Bayt and make the Qur'an our mediation to the noblest stations of Thy honour,
a ladder by which we may climb to the place of safety, a cause for our being repaid with
deliverance at the Plain of Resurrection, and a means whereby we may reach the bliss of
the Ahlul-Bayt of Permanence! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and his Ahlul-Bayt, lessen for us through
the Qur'an the weight of heavy sins, give to us the excellent qualities of the pious, and
make us follow the tracks of those who stood before Thee in the watches of the night and
the ends of the day, such that Thou purifiest us from every defilement through its
purification and makest us to follow the tracks of those who have taken illumination from
its light and whom expectation has not distracted from works, cutting them off through its
delusions' deceptions! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and his Ahlul-Bayt and appoint the Qur'an for
us an intimate in the shadows of nights and a guardian against the instigations of Satan
and confusing thoughts, for our feet an obstruction from passing to acts of disobedience,
for our tongues a silencer without blight preventing a plunge into falsehood, for our
limbs a restrainer from committing sins, and for the scrutiny of heedfulness rolled up in
heedlessness an unroller, such that Thou attachest to our hearts the understanding of the
Qur'an's wonders and its restraining similitudes which immovable mountains in all their
solidity were too weak to carry! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and his Ahlul-Bayt and through the
Qur'an make permanent the rightness of our outward selves, veil the ideas of confusing
thoughts from the soundness of our innermost minds, wash away the dirt of our hearts and
the ties of our heavy sins, gather our scattered affairs, quench the thirst of our burning
heat in the standing place of the presentation to Thee, and clothe us in the robes of
security on the Day of the Greatest Terror at our uprising! </p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and his
Ahlul-Bayt and through the Qur'an redress our lack - our destitution in poverty - drive
toward us the comforts of life and an abundance of plentiful provisions, turn aside
blameworthy character traits and base moral qualities, and preserve us from the pit of
unbelief and the motives for hypocrisy, such that the Qur'an may be for us at the
resurrection a leader to Thy good pleasure and Thy gardens, for us in this world a
protector against Thy displeasure and transgressing Thy bounds and for what is with Thee a
witness by its declaring lawful the lawful and its declaring unlawful the unlawful!

</p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and his Ahlul-Bayt and through the Qur'an make easy for our souls at death
the distress of the driving, the effort of the moaning, and the succession of the
rattling, when souls reach the throats and it is said, 'Where is the enchanter?'; when the
angel of death discloses himself to seize them from behind the veils of unseen things,
letting loose at them from the bow of destinies the arrows of the terror of lonesome
separation, and mixing for them from sudden death a cup poisoned to the taste; and when
departure and release for the hereafter come close to us, works become collars around the
necks, and the graves become the haven until the appointed time of the Day of Encounter!
</p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and his Ahlul-Bayt, make blessed for us the arrival at the
house of decay and the drawn out residence between the layers of the earth, appoint the graves,
after separation from this world, the best of our waystations, make roomy for us through
Thy mercy the narrowness of our tombs, and disgrace us not among those present at the
Resurrection through our ruinous sins! Through the Qur'an have mercy upon the lowliness of
our station at the standing place of presentation to Thee, make firm the slips of our feet
during the shaking of the bridge across hell on the day of passage over it, illuminate the
darkness of our graves before the Uprising, and deliver us from every distress on the Day
of Resurrection and from the hardships of terrors on the Day of Disaster! Whiten our faces
on the day when the faces of wrongdoers are blackened during the Day of Regret and
Remorse, appoint love for us in the breasts of the faithful, and make not life for us troublesome!
</p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad, Thy servant and Thy messenger, just as He delivered Thy message, executed Thy command and counselled Thy servants!
</p><p align="justify">O Allah, on the Day of
Resurrection make our Prophet (Thy blessings be upon him and his Ahlul-Bayt) the nearest of
the prophets to Thee in seat, the ablest of them before Thee with intercession, the
greatest of them with Thee in measure, and the most eminent of them with Thee in rank!
</p><p align="justify">O Allah, bless Muhammad and the Ahlul-Bayt of Muhammad, ennoble his edifice, magnify his proof,
make weighty his balance, accept his intercession, bring near his mediation, whiten his
face, complete his light, and raise his degree! Make us live according to his Sunna, make
us die in his creed, take us on his road, make us travel his path, place us among the
people who obey him, muster us in his band, lead us to up his pool, and give us to drink
of his cup! And bless Muhammad and his Ahlul-Bayt, with a blessing through which Thou wilt
take him to the most excellent of Thy good, Thy bounty, and Thy generosity for which he hopes! Thou art Possessor of boundless mercy and generous bounty.
</p><p align="justify">O Allah, repay him for Thy
messages which he delivered, Thy signs which he passed on, the good counsel he gave to Thy
servants, and the struggle he undertook in Thy way, with the best Thou hast repaid any of
Thy angels brought nigh and Thy prophets sent out and chosen! And upon him and his
Ahlul-Bayt, the good, the pure, be peace, Allah's mercy, and His blessings!
