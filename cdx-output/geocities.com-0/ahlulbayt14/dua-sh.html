<b>THE INVOCATION OF SHABANIYAH</b></font></center>
<hr width="80%">
<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, bestow Your blessings on Muhammad and his

descendants; respond to my prayer when I pray to You;

listen to my call when I call You; and turn to me when I

make my submission to You in confidence. I have come

running to You and am standing before You imploring You

in humility and hoping to get the reward You have for me.

You know what is in my heart, and You are aware of what I

need. You know my mind and are not unaware of my future

and of my present, of what I want to begin my speech

with; of the request I would utter, and of the hopes I

have in regard to my ultimate lot.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, whatever You have destined for me up to the

end of my life, whether concerning the open aspect of my

life or the hidden aspect of it, is bound to come. What

is to my advantage and what is to my disadvantage - all

my losses and gains are in Your hand, not in the hand of anybody else.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, if You deprive me, who else will provide me;

and if You let me down, who else will help me?</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, I seek Your protection from Your anger and

from earning Your displeasure. If I am not fit for

gaining Your Mercy, You are certainly fit to be generous

to me by virtue of Your Magnanimity.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, I see as if I am standing before You

protected by my trust in You. You said what befitted You

and covered me with Your forgiveness.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, if You forgive me, then who is more suited

than You to do that? If the time of my death has come

near and my deeds have not still brought me close to You,

I make this confession of my sins a means of approaching

You. I have been unjust to my soul for I have not looked

after it. It will certainly be doomed if You do not forgive it.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, You have always been kind to me during my

life time. Therefore do not cut off Your favour from me

at the time of my death.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, how can I lose the hope, of Your looking

kindly, in me after my death, when you have always been good to me during my life.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, in my case do what befits You and bestow Your

favour on me - a sinner enwrapped in his ignorance.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, You have concealed many of my sins in this

world. I am in a greater need of their being conceded in

the next. As You have not revealed my sins even to any of

Your pious bondmen, do not expose me on the Day of Resurrection before everybody.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, Your generosity has expanded my aspiration,

and Your forgiveness is superior to my deeds. Therefore

gladden my heart by allowing me to meet You on the day

You administer justice to Your bondmen.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, my apology to You is the apology of him who

cannot afford his apology being not accepted. Therefore

accept my apology, You the Most Magnanimous of those to

whom the evil - doers tender their apology.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, do not turn down my request; do not foil my

desire', and do not cut off my hope and expectation of You.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, if You had wanted to disgrace me, You would

not have guided me; and if You had wanted to expose my

faults and vices, You would not have kept me safe and sound.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, I do not think that You will turn down my

request for that in asking You for which I have spent my whole life.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, all praise is due to You, always and for

ever, growing not diminishing, as You like and please.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, if You condemn me for my crimes, I will cling

to Your forgiveness, and if You hold me for my sins, I

will cling to Your granting pardon. If You haul me into

the hell, I will tell its inmates that I love You.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, if my deeds are too small in relation to how

I should obey You, my aspirations are high enough as

compared to what I should expect of You.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, how can I go away from You unsuccessful and

disappointed, when I had a high hope that You will be

kind enough to send me away enjoying safety and deliverance.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, I have wasted my life committing the crime of

forgetting You and played havoc with my youth,

intoxicated with keeping myself away from You.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, I did not wake up when I was under a delusion

about You and was inclined to earn Your displeasure.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, I am Your bondman, son of Your bondman. I am

standing before You, trying to use Your own magnanimity as a means of approaching You.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, I am a bondman of Yours, I want to rid myself

of the sins I used to commit in Your presence because I

lacked the sense of feeling ashamed that You were looking

at me. I request You to forgive me, because forgiveness

is a characteristic of Your Kindness.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, I was not strong enough to move away from

Your disobedience, except when You awakened me to Your

love. I was exactly as You wanted me to be. I am thankful

to You for introducing me to Your Kindness and purging my

heart of the impurities of being inattentive to You.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, look upon me as the person whom You called

and he responded to You, whom You helped by using his

services, and he obeyed You. You Near One, Who is not far

from one who is away from You. You Munificent, Who does

not withhold His reward from one who hopes for it.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, provide me with a heart, the passion of which

may bring it near You, with a tongue the truth of which

may be submitted to You, and with a vision the nature of which may bring it close to You.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, whoever gets acquainted with You, is not

unknown; whoever takes shelter under You, is not

disappointed; and one to whom You turn, is not a slave.

One who follows Your path is enlightened; and one who takes refuge in You, is saved.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, I have taken refuge in You. Therefore do not

disappoint me of Your Mercy and do not keep me secluded from Your Kindness.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, place me among Your friends in the position

of one who hopes for an increase in Your love.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, inspire me with a passionate love of

remembering You so that I may keep on remembering You,

and by Your Holy Name and Pure Position cherish my

cheerful determination into a success.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, I invoke You to admit me to the place

reserved for those who obey You, and to attach me to the

nice abode of those who enjoy Your good pleasure.
I can neither defend my self nor do I control what is advantageous for me.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, I am Your powerless sinning slave and Your

repentant bondman. So do not make me one of those from

whom You turn away Your face. and whom his negligence has secluded from Your forgiveness.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, grant me complete severance of my relations

with everything else and total submission to You.

Enlighten the eyes of our hearts with the light of their

looking at You to the extent that they penetrate the

veils of light and reach the Source of Grandeur, and let

our souls get suspended by the glory of Your sanctity.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, make me one of those whom You call and they

respond; when You look at and they are thunderstruck by

Your majesty. You whisper to them secretly and they work for You openly.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, I have not allowed my pessimistic despair to

overcome my good opinion about You, nor did I ever lose my hope of Your benevolence.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, if my errors have degraded me with You, You

may forgive me in view of my unqualified reliance on You.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, if my sins have made me unfit to receive Your

tender affection, my firm belief has reminded me of Your Compassion.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, if my disregard for preparations to meet You

has put me to sleep, my knowledge of Your kind bounties has awakened me.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, if Your severe punishment calls me to Hell,

the abundance of Your reward invites me to Paradise.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, I ask You and pray to You earnestly, I desire

and request You to show Your favour to Muhammad and his

descendants, make me one of those who always remember You

and never violate the pledge they make to You, who do not

fail to show You their gratitude and do not take Your orders lightly.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">My Lord, let me be attached to the

Light of Your Majestic Glory, so that I may know You

alone, be away from others, and have a heart fearful of

You and an eye watchful of You. May Allah's blessing and

peace be on Muhammad and those of his descendants who are pure.</p>
