</p><p align="center"><font size="6"><b>Few Questions to Sunni Scholars</b></font>
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="75%">
<p>Dear Sunni `Ulama, may Allah protects you all, Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullah wa barakatuh,
</p><p align="justify">We hope that you are enjoying yourselves, and we beg Allah, the
Master,to protect you. We hereby, present to you some questions
regardingreligion and beliefs. And we would like to receive your
kind answers andexplanations.
</p><p>We would like to Thank you in advance for your response.
</p><p>Yours sincerely,
</p><p>A group of your brothers.
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="75%">
<p></p><h3>Question No.1</h3>
<p align="justify">The books of Sihah, especially the sahih of al-Bukhari and Muslim,
bothhave conveyed hadiths from the Holy Prophet (s) in which
manyhuman characteristics such as face, eyes, hands, fingers,
legs, feet, andetc... have been attributed to Allah. In those hadiths
it is also said that Helaughs, has a certain place, He comes down
from heaven to theterrestrial world, and soon [1].</p><p align="justify">
Now, our question is:</p><p align="justify">
a- How could the ancestors accept such fabricated hadiths? Why
didn'tthey check the chain of narrators of these hadiths? Does not
thesehadiths clearly refer to incarnation?</p><p align="justify">
b- How could the ancestors urge the Muslims to believe in the
outwardmeaning of such hadiths without searching the
inwardmeaning [2], sincetheir outward meaning forces us to
believe in the incarnation of Allah,and the Sunnis do not believe in
incarnation, especially when it is to beattributed to Allah, the
Exalted?</p><p align="justify">
c- The same Sihah have conveyed other part of prophetic hadiths
whichdeclare that a human being can see Allah, the Exalted, by his
naturaleyes, and that in the Dooms Day He shall appear to those
who see as afullmoon [3]. According to this, all Sunni scholars,
narrators, and theimams of the four main sects of Islam, believe
that it is possible to seeAllah, the Exalted, and have considered
that as one of the principles thatconsist theirbelief [4]. Moreover,
imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal regardsanyone who does not believe in
the possibility of seeing Allah as anirreligious infidel and a
polytheist (tafseer al-Manar, vol.9, p.135).</p><p align="justify">
Here, we ask:</p><p align="justify">
Does not the meaning of those hadiths contradict the concepts of
the Holy Quran in which Allah, the Exalted says:"Vision
comprehends Himnot, and He comprehends (all) vision..."(An`am:
103); and "he said: MyLord! show me (Thyself), so that I may look
upon Thee. He said: Youcannot (bear to) see Me..."(A`raaf: 143);
and "nothing like a likeness ofHim"(Shura: 11); and "And when you
said: O Musa! we will not believe inyou untill we see Allah
manifestly, so the punishment overtook you whileyou looked
on"(Baqarah: 55).</p><p align="justify">
And does not such a notion contradict rational intelligence, since
lookingupon something requires that the seen thing exists in a
certain place,and that it is a certain distance away from looker.
Consequently, both thelooker and the seen thing shall be in front
of each others, and suchcondition cannot apply to the Creator, the
Exalted, because that meansthat His Holy Essence must be
regarded as a certain material; and thus,He shall be in need of an
abode and direction. But, as we know, suchconditions are only
related to materials, and it is also known that theSunni `ulama do
not believe in incarnation?</p><p align="justify">
Now, if these hadiths are contrary to the Holy Quran and
rationalintelligence, then how could Sunni `ulama accept them and
agree uponthem without even discussing their chains of narrators
ordocumentation? However, is it correct to agree on these hadiths
onlybecause they have been mentioned in the two Sahihs?
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="75%">
<p></p><h3>Question No.2</h3>
<p align="justify">Many Sunni `ulama do not agree with most of Muhammad
AbdulWahhab's opinions. Some of those opinions are:</p><p align="justify">
1- He considers the imitation of an imam of the four famous
Islamic sectsas heresy and illegal.</p><p align="justify">
2- He regards all Muslims as polytheists because of the rites
andceremonies they are performing, while imam Abi Hanifa does
not agreeon considering any Muslim as a polytheist.</p><p align="justify">
3- He thinks that even the prophets shall undergo an ordinary life
afterdeath, and that they shall not be distinguished from other
human beingsduring the isthmian interval, while the Hanafi `ulama
believe that theprophets shall have distinguished life after their
death, moredistinguishing than the isthmian interval. They also
explain the reasonwhy the Prophet's wives were forbidden to other
men. They say that thisis because the Prophet (s) is alive even
after his death.</p><p align="justify">
4- He considers visiting the Prophet's tomb as illegal and heresy,
whileSunnis regard it as mustahabb, and sometimes, according to
some oftheir `ulama it is wajib.</p><p align="justify">
5- He considers the celebration of the Prophet's birthday as
heresy,while the majority of Muslims regard it as mustahabb.
6- He considers Qunoot (raising of the hands for du`a while in
prayer) aheresy, while the rest of the Muslims regard it as a part of
du`a.</p><p align="justify">
7- Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab and his followers considers the
ritesthat a dervish (murshid) practices in the majalis of dhikr and
otherspiritual ceremonies is mere heresy, while the majority of
Muslimsconsiders it as a recommended act in order to have more
spiritual potential [1].</p><p align="justify">
8- The same Abdul Wahhab and followers consider asking
intercessionfrom the Holy Prophet (s) and other saints as illegal
(haram) and as atype of polytheism, but we see that Sunni
Muslims are performing that.</p><p align="justify">
These wicked and extreme opinions of Muhammad ibn Abdul
Wahhabare strongly refuted by the ancestors of the Sunni
Muslims. They alsohave compiled lots of books regarding this
issue, in which they couldprove the vanity of such opinions in
comparison with the Holy Quran andthe prophetic sunnah.
Ibn `Abdeen, a grand Sunni scholar, had described the followers
ofAbdul Wahhab as the historical sect called Khawarij who
rebelled againstImam Ali (a), because, as he thought, both
sects are pretending thatthey are the only representatives of Islam
and that all other Muslim sectsare infidel, and they should be
slaughtered along with theirscholars [2].</p><p align="justify">
However, in these days, in spite of this great difference
betweenSunnism and Wahhabism, we witness that the relationship
between bothsects has improved - and the Sunnis have given up
their struggle againstthe Wahhabis.</p><p align="justify">
Thus, we ask: Can this approaching and harmonization be
consideredas a conclusion for the harmonization occurred
between the two schoolsof thought? Shall that be a retreat of one
part towards the other part? Orcan we consider that as a result of
the political and economicalpressures?
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="75%">
<p></p><h3>Question No.3</h3>
<p align="justify">Without doubt, the main issue that caused the division of the</p><p align="justify">
Muslimsinto two sects, Sunni and Shi`a, is the different opinion of
each secttowards Imamate and Caliphate after the demise of the
Holy Prophet (s). Shi`a says that imamate, like any other
religious issues, must beunder the control of Islamic legislation,
and that the succeeding andelecting of an imam as a successor
and vicegerent of the Holy Prophet (s) must be according to
Allah's commandment through His Prophet -since imamate is a
continuation of the prophecy, especially in its majorobligations.
Imamate is the method by which a society is guided - it isthe
faithful custodian of the religion that holds its main duties to
beguidance and upbringing.</p><p align="justify">
The Sunnis, on the other hand, believe that imamate is a matter
that hasa close relationship with the ummah (nation). That is to say
that it isupon the ummah to elect the appropriate leader, as it is
their exclusiveright to do so.</p><p align="justify">
However, the Shi`ites have their own demonstrations, both rational
andconclusive, to prove their belief about imamate, some of which
are asfollows:</p><p align="justify">
1- It is impossible that the Holy Prophet had left the issue of
imamatewithout specifying and appointing his successor. This is
because themost critical issue after his demise would have been
the rational andpolitical leadership. Without a responsible
leadership there shall be agreat vacancy which may cause serious
catastrophe to the Muslims,especially if we take into consideration
the dangerous of internal divisionsof the Islamic ummah - between
the Ansars, the Muhajireen, and - thewicked factor inside the heart
of the ummah - the hypocrites whose aimalways was to destroy
Islam. This is in addition to outside factors, whichwere threatening
the ummah at that time. Thus, it would not bereasonable for an
apostolic leader to neglect this critical issue - letting itpass by
without giving it any heed. Hence, Muhammad (s), as theSeal of
the Prophets and he who Allah had said about him: "Certainly
anApostle has come to you from among yourselves; grievous to
him isyour falling into distress, excessively solicitous respecting
you; to thebelievers (he is) compassionate, merciful"[Tawbah:
128], must fulfill thisjob very accurately.
If we check the texts of the Holy Quran we can discover that the
Holy Legislator had paid great attention to the issue of writing a will,
statingthat a man must write his will so that his children and
relatives may notsuffer from confusion and unexpected conflicts,
as the Quranic versedeclares: "Bequest is prescribed for you
when death approaches one ofyou, if he leaves behind wealth for
parents and near relatives, accordingto usage, a duty (incumbent)
upon those who guard (against evil)[Baqarah: 180]".</p><p align="justify">
A prophetic tradition said,"Whosoever dies without writing a will,
thencertainly he shall die as a pagan". This tradition informs us that
theLegislator (Allah) is very precise with a personal matter such as
thewriting of a will; so, how can such an important matter like
"leadership"be neglected - leaving the Islamic ummah to face
unperceived destiny?!
Now, let us suppose that the Holy Prophet (s) didn't refer to
thisserious issue, wasn't it his companions' duty to ask him about
the matterof succession?
Therefore, in conclusion, because of the circumstances of the
Islamicummah at that time, there was need to give special care to
such anissue.</p><p align="justify">
2- According to what has been said, it is normal that the Holy
Prophet (s) stands positively beside this sensitive case and
declares the mainpoints of the succession after him. Thus, we
cannot possibly supposebut one of two probabilities: (1) either the
Prophet (s) has to politicallybring up the Muhajireen and Ansar
according to the rules of a shura(counsel) - when they want to
elect a leader (whether spiritual orpolitical). After showing them the
bases of how to practise such an act,for example, appointing a
so-called committee consisting of membersfrom both parties (i.e.
Muhajireen and Ansar), or it was upon him toappoint a certain
person who is capable to hold this heavyresponsibility.
It is clear that history didn't convey to us any trace of the first
probability,neither through the Holy Prophet's (s) attitudes, nor
in the policy ofthe caliphs after him. Therefore, the second
probability seems to bemore logical.</p><p align="justify">
3- A quick and brief look at the series of events that the
Prophet'smission has undergone, from the first moments of the
mission until thelast seconds when his holy soul was leaving this
world, we come to thisconclusion that the Holy Prophet (s) had
referred in many occasionsto Imam Ali's (a) virtues, great status,
and other unique characteristics,showing that he is the best
among the Prophet's companions. Inaddition to this, Ali was
brought up by the Holy Prophet (s) himself; hewas the first male
who believed in the Prophet's mission and the onlyMuslim who
never bowed to an idol before. Moreover, Imam Ali spentmost of
his life accompanying the Holy Prophet (s). Imam
Aliparticipated in almost all the battles that occured between the
Muslimsand the polytheists, and he was sipping on the pure cup of
knowledgedirectly from the Holy Prophet (s). All Imam Ali's
behaviour, piety,worshipping, and etc... were indifferent to those of
the Holy Prophet (s). Most of the heroes from among the
polytheist were slaughteredby Imam Ali's sword in the battles of
Badr, Uhud, Khaybar, Khandaq,and other famous wars. There was
only one battle that Imam Ali did notparticipate in; it was the battle
of Tabook, when the Holy Prophet (s)himself ordered him to
stay in Medina and protect it from anyunexpected attack. Before
the battle of Khaybar, the Holy Prophet (s)said, describing
Imam Ali,: "I am going to give the banner of this battle toa man
who loves Allah and His Apostle, and Allah and His Apostle
lovehim too. A man who is combative."[1] And when the Holy
Prophet (s) ordered him to stay in Medina, he said to him,"You
have the same rank,with me, that Aaron had with his brother
Moses, except that there is notany prophet after me."[2] The Holy
Prophet also had said, "I am the cityof knowledge, and Ali is its
gate"[3], and "Ali is the best of judges amongyou."[4] He also said,
"Ali moves with Quran, and Quran moves with Ali;they won't
separate from each other until they both arrive to me near
thePool"[5], and "Ali moves with truth and truth turns with him
wherever heturns,"[6], and "No one loves Ali save a believer, and
no one hates himsave a hypocrite"[7] and other traditions which
have been agreed uponby all Muslims and were mentioned in their
sihah.</p><p align="justify">
A tradition was narrated for the benefit of Imam Ali (a), his wife
(Fatimaal-Zahra (a)) and their two beloved sons, al-Hasan and
al-Husayn (a), that the Holy Prophet (s) had said, "O my Lord!
these are themembers of my family." and upon this Allah sent
down verses to himsaying, "Allah only desires to keep away the
uncleanness from you, Opeople of the House! and to purify you a
(thorough) purifying" (Ahzab:33); and "But whoever disputes with
you in this matter after what hascome to you of knowledge, they
say: Come let us call our sons and yoursons and our women and
your women and our near people and yournear people, then let us
be earnest in prayer, and pray for the curse ofAllah on the liars."
(Aal `Imran: 61) Allah also says, "Say: I do not ask ofyou any
reward for it but love for my near relatives" (Shuraa: 23), and"And
they give food out of love for Him to the Poor and the orphan
andthe captive." (al-Dahr: 8) Another verse mentioned about them
is: "OnlyAllah is your Vali and His Apostle and those who believe,
those whokeep up prayers and pay the poor-rate while they bow"
(Ma'idah: 55),and "... and that the retaining ear might retain it"
(Haqqah: 12), and manyother holy verses.
All these Quranic verses and in addition to prophetic traditions
arereferring to the preference of Imam Ali over others as a leader,
Imam andcaliph after the Holy Prophet (s). Rather, the Holy
Prophet (s) hadopenly declared this by the command of Allah
Who ordered him saying,"O Apostle! deliver what has been
revealed to you from your Lord; and ifyou do it not, then you have
not delivered His message, and Allah willprotect you from the
people" (Ma'idah: 67). This verse descended on theDay of
Ghadeer, during his (s) return from Mecca. When he
deliveredthis verse, he ordered the pilgrims to perform the
prayers. After that, hedelivered an oration wherein he said, "Am I
not the Master of you all?",the whole crowd answered: Sure, O
Apostle of Allah. He continued,"Then, whosoever I am his master,
Ali is his master. O Allah! be fried towhom he becomes his friend,
and be enemy to whom he becomes hisenemy..."[14]</p><p align="justify">
Even, the Holy Prophet (s), in the last moments of his life he
wantedto put his speech in a written legal form and to call the
companions towitness this action; thus, he called the companions
- and `Umar ibnal-Khattab was among them. When the Holy
Prophet (s) began hisspeech, `Umar immediately got the point
and retained the aim of theProphet's call, so he (i.e. `Umar) said :
It is obvious that pain and illnesshave overcame the Prophet
(s)!!! Other narrators declared that `Umarrather said, "It is clear
that the Prophet is hallucinating. The Book of Allahis sufficient for
us"!!! The companions were then divided into two groups,one
accepted the suggestion of `Umar, and the other protested
againsthis rough words and manner. And when they began to
argue loudly, the Holy Prophet (s) said to them, "Go away and
leave me alone!"</p><p align="justify">
In a dialogue that occurred between `Umar and Ibn Abbas, `Umar
said,"The Apostle of Allah saved a serious sentence and he
wanted to say itin that gathering during his last illness. A sentence
that cannot be refutedby any pretension or excuse. He wanted Ali
to sit on his throne after him.He was about to mention Ali's name,
but I stood between him and that."This same dialogue has also
been mentioned in (Sharhu Nahjil Balagha)by Ibn Abi al-Hadeed,
vol.III, p.141, published by Dar al-Fikr, and invol.III, p.764 of
Maktabat al-Hayat's publication.</p><p align="justify">
4- Now, because the legal caliphate was the right of Ali, he and the
restof Bani Hashim, and many other companions refused to give
allegianceto Abu Bakr after the gathering of Saqifah. Imam Ali did
not giveallegiance to Abu Bakr at that time, rather, after several
months hadpassed. And his giving of allegiance to Abu Bakr was
only to protect theIslamic ummah from unexpected troubles or
calamities; and it was a wayto protect the Muslims from division
and argumentation.</p><p align="justify">
However, Imam Ali showed in many occasions, in the presence of
manycompanions, his objection (to this sistuation) and that it is his
right, priorto anyone else, to have the caliphateship in his hand.
5- Some Muslims may say that it is not logical to say that the
Prophet'scompanions, who are considered the elite of the
Muslims, have rebelledagainst his (the Prophet's) will to give the
caliphate to Imam Ali. TheShi`ites' answer to this suspicion, is that
by studying the biographies ofsome of the Prophet's companions
we can discover that many of themhave considering themselves
as the most appropriate persons to be theProphet's successor;
and many times and on many occasions they wereopposed the
Prophet's suggestions or orders - especially thosesuggestions
and orders that concerned the relationship of public affairsand
policy, wars, administrations, and so on. This was clear even
duringthe lifetime of the Holy Prophet (s) and became more
clear after hisdemise. They were giving themselves the right to
discuss the Prophet'scommands and to argue against any of his
proposals. `Umar ibnal-Khattab was the leader of such a group. It
was he who protestedagainst the Prophet's acceptance of the
treaty between the Muslims andthe polytheists of Mecca, known
as "Sulh al-Hudaybiyah". `Umar also wasthe one who refuted the
Holy Prophet's legislation called "mut`ah of Hajj".Other
companions refused to join the army of Usamah ibn Zayd
whomwas prepared by the command of the Holy Prophet (s)
himself. Hehad appointed Usamah ibn Zayd to be a commander in
a battle againstthe Romans - exactly few days before his demise.
`Umar also preventedthe attendants from bringing the paper and
ink which the Holy Prophet(s) had requested to write some
important text.</p><p align="justify">
Here, our question is: Did not all these rational and intellectual
reasonsand proofs indicate on the fact that the Holy Prophet had
indeedappointed Ali to be his successor and the caliph after him?
Some of theProphet's companions were planning, even during his
lifetime, to concealthis important issue; and, thus, transferring the
caliphateship from theHouse of Bani Hashim to some men of
Quraysh, for legal and maybesometimes illegal purposes - God
knows the truth. If so, then why doessome Islamic sects, other
than the Shi`a, blame the Shi`ites for adheringto the Household of the Holy Prophet (s)?
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="75%">
<p></p><h3>Question No.4</h3>
<p align="justify">The historical records relate that Fatima al-Zahra (a), the
daughter ofthe Holy Prophet (s), was angry with the two shaykhs
(i.e. Abu Bakrand `Umar) until she died. For this very reason she
requested herhusband, Ali ibn Abi Talib (a), to bury her in
secret, permitting only afew of the very close companions of the
Holy Prophet (s) such Salman al-Farsi and Abu Tharr to know
of her barial. She also askedImam Ali to conceal her grave, as a
form of protest.</p><p align="justify">
The reasons for this protestation can be explained as follows:</p><p align="justify">
1- `Umar's and his followers attacked the house of Imam Ali (a)
andset it on fire. This was done in order to force Imam Ali and his
adherentsto give allegiance to Abu Bakr.</p><p align="justify">
2- Abu Bakr's and `Umar's refusal to give back to Fatima her
inheritance(from her father).</p><p align="justify">
3- Also because she considered Ali as the legal successor
andvicegerent of the Holy Prophet (s).</p><p align="justify">
Historians have narrated that, when `Umar ibn al-Khattab brought
somewood in order to set Imam Ali's (a) house on fire, he was
told thatFatima, the daughter of the Holy Prophet (s), is inside
the house too!He replied: LET IT BE!!! Then he kindled the fire
and began to set fire tothe house of the daughter of the Holy
Prophet! "O son of Khattab! areyou really going to set our house
on fire?" Fatima (a) asked. `Umarreplied, "Sure! Unless you
agree on what the whole ummah had agreedupon." The daughter
of the Holy Prophet (s) said, "I do not remembera people that
have done worse than yours... You have left the Holy Prophet's
body lying among us, while, at the same time, you were busyin
electing a caliph among yourselves, without consulting us or
askingour opinion. You have plainly misappropriated our right."
Then `Umar andmuhajirin proceeded in burning the house!
Al-Ya`qoobi, in his book, had recorded the following:"There were a
bunchof people who attacked the house. They broke Ali's sword,
and pulledout Ali with all the force they could muster and drove
him toward AbuBakr. Then Fatima cried `O Father! O the Apostle
of Allah! see what weare facing because of the son of Ibn
al-Khattab and Ibn Abi Quhafah(Abu Bakr) after your demise.' A
warm argumentation occurred betweenAli and those who were
attending the meeting in the presence of AbuBakr, `Umar, and
Abu `Ubaydah. Ali tried to explain to the people hisright to be the
caliphate and his deserving of this position, but that didn'tplease
`Umar who then began to threaten Ali if the latter refused to
giveallegiance to Abu Bakr, and said to Ali:"You have no choice
but to giveallegiance!" "And what if I refused to give allegiance?"
Ali asked. `Umarreplied roughly, "I swear by Allah, the only god,
that we shall behead youimmediately!" Ali said,"Then you are
going to kill whom he is the servantof Allah and the brother of the
Apostle of Allah?" `Umar angrilyanswered, "It is right that you are
the servant of Allah, but it is not truethat you are the brother of the
Apostle of Allah." After this dialogue, ImamAli then left the
meeting and walked toward the tomb of the Holy Prophet(s).
There, he began to cry and speak to the tomb saying,"Son of
mymother! surely the people reckoned me weak and had well-nigh
slainme!"</p><p align="justify">
Regarding the issue that Abu Bakr and `Umar had refused to give
backto Fatima her inheritance, one can refer to various historical
sources andfind more details.</p><p align="justify">
When Fatima (a) was ill for the last time before her demise, Abu
Bakrand `Umar visited her. She seized the opportunity and spoke
to them,"Ishall inform you a hadith of the Holy Prophet, but, shall
you be honestenough and tell me whether you have heard it from
the Holy Prophet ornot?" "Sure we will!" They both answered.
Then Fatima (a) said,"Iadminister an oath to you to say the truth.
Didn't you hear the Holy Prophet (s) say that, "Fatima's
satisfaction is my satisfaction, and ifshe becomes angry I will
become angry too. He who seek Fatima's love,is as one who
seeks my love; and he who satisfies Fatima, it is as if hehas
satisfied me. Whosoever makes Fatima angry shall make me
angrytoo." Abu Bakr and `Umar said, "For sure we have heard this
hadith fromthe Apostle of Allah." "Then I bear witness that you two
have made meangry and did not satisfied me. When I meet the
Prophet (s), I shallcomplain to him against both of you." Fatima
(a) continued. Here, AbuBakr said, "I seek refuge in Allah
against His anger and your anger,Fatima!" Then he began to cry
until his soul was about to come out ofhis body. Fatima (a)
continued, saying, "By Allah I shall curse you inevery prayer I may
perform!"</p><p align="justify">
Here, our question is: What is your opinion in this regard, to the
mannerof the two Shaykhs toward the Household of the Holy
Prophet (s)?Wasn't it more humane for Abu Bakr and `Umar to
satisfy the Householdof the Holy Prophet (s), especially during
and after loosing their (theHousehold's) Great Father, the Holy
Prophet (s)? Would it not havebeen more honorable if Abu
Bakr and `Umar tried to solve thesuspended issues between them
and Ali (a) and Fatima (a) and atthe same time they could
have keep the respect of the Holy Prophet(s) and guarded the benefit of the Islamic Ummah?
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="75%">
<p></p><h3>Question No.5</h3>
<p align="justify">What was the reason for the argument between the Muslims in the
situation when some companions were preventing the
Holy Prophet (s) from writing down his will?</p><p align="justify">
1- The holy body of the Prophet (s) was still lying on the bed
when allthose disputes occurred, concerning the matter of who
shall succeedhim after his demise. And if some of the
companions had done what the Holy Prophet (s) had asked
them (i.e. by bringing the ink and a pen)such catastrphies wouldn't
have happened among the Islamic sects.
In a tradition narrated in the sahih of al-Bukhaari (vol.1, chpater
no.83), itis said that the companions who were present during the
moment of the Holy Prophet's death divided into two parties: a
party called to bring theink and pen to the Holy Prophet (s), and
the other party tried toprevent that. And if the second party had
obeyed the Holy Prophet(s), would they therefore, need to
fabricate a false character calledAbdullah ibn Saba' and relate all
the confusions to him, and free thosecompanions who were the
main players in this objection from any chargeor responsibility? Is
it possible for anyone who works in the field ofresearching and
study history to be convinced with illogicalinterpretations of those
events?</p><p align="justify">
2- Without doubt the source of the Islamic differences returns to
thosewho did the following:</p><p align="justify">
a- Preparing the appropriate ground and time for the Umayyad and
theAbbaside dynasties. This is especially seen in the time of
Mu`awiyah,who had destroyed the powers of Islam and distorted
its facts.</p><p align="justify">
b- Excilling many of the faithful companions of the Holy Prophet
(s)from Medina, such as Abu Tharr al-Ghifaari whom the Holy
Prophet(s) had described him saying, "There isn't a person
upon whom atree's shadow fell, or a piece of ground hold, truer
than Abu Tharr!" Andon the other hand, they had returned all those
whom the Holy Prophet(s) had exciled or dismissed like
al-Hakam ibn al-`Aass, Marwan ibnal-Hakam (to whom Othman had
given his daughter as a wife) while it isnot compatible with the Holy
Prophet's (s) tradition.</p><p align="justify">
c- All those who had participated in the assassination of Othman
werepeople like Marwan ibn al-Hakam who killed Talha ibn
al-Zubayr in thebattle al-Jamal, and forged the seal of Othman that
was supposed to besent to the wali of Egypt, which of course was
the main reason for theanger of the Egyptians against the caliph.</p><p align="justify">
d- Those who
broke their allegiane to Imam Ali (a), and began to
rebelagainst him, especially in the battles of Siffin, al-Jamal, and
al-Nahrawan.In fact, if Mu`awiyah, Talha, Zubayr, `Ayisha, and the
chiefs of theKharijites would not have incited their followers to
participate in battlesagainst Imam Ali (a),then all the riots and
arguments among theMuslims would not have occured - leading
them to such a miserablesituation like that which they are living in
nowadays. Nor would it havebeen possible for the deviators, the
irreligious, or the hypocrites to leadthe Islamic ummah to that
catastrophic deviation.</p><p align="justify">
e- Wasn't the assassination of Othman a plea to create two
destroyingbattles in which many of the Prophet's companions
were killed? Wasn'tthe battle of Nahrawan a logical result for the
battle of Siffin? Can anyonedeny that the active factors for inciting
`Ayisha (the Prophet's wife) toparticipate in a battle in which she
had indeed disgraced the respect ofthe Holy Prophet (s), were
the Umayyad and the Marwanian, andbecause of her many of the
pious were martyred for their resistanceagainst that gang who had
gone astray?</p><p align="justify">
f- Wasn't that gang the same gang who fought against Ali (a)
and hishousehold? Did not they deny the Aalul Bayt's virtues and
fabricatedfalse hadiths which insulted them and eulogized their
enemies?
Some Sunni ulama and researchers blame Mu`awiyah for what
theummah had faced, and they considered his acts contradictary
to theIslamic rules. At the same time, some of them used to
eulogizeMu`awiyah and began to justify his acts, deeds, and
deviations. They callhim the writer of the revelation and the uncle
of the believers, while thereare many other companions who
deserve this title more than him -people like Muhammad ibn Abi
Bakr.</p><p align="justify">
Didn't Mu`awiyah fight Imam Hasan (a), the son of the Holy
Prophet(s), and after he made a treaty with Imam Hasan (a)
he broke hisoath and planned against Imam Hasan (a)?
Didn't he kill all the companions of the Holy Prophet (s) such as
Hijribn `Adiyy without any reason or accusation except for the
reason that heloves Ali and adheres to his way? Didn't he order
his gang to insultImam Ali (a) on the pulpit, in all states and
provinces, which lasted untilthe period of `Umar ibn `Abdil `Aziz?
Wasn't Mu`awiyah the one whomthe Holy Prophet (s) had
cursed()?
Wasn't it right that Mu`awiyah had broken the terms of the peace
treatywith Imam Hasan (a) by appointing his son Yazid as his
successor?Wasn't it Yazid who killed the son of the Holy Prophet
(s) (i.e. ImamHusayn), invaded Mecca, and assassinated its
inhabitants? Was notMu`awiyah his son's partner in all those
crimes?</p><p align="justify">
Why did `Ayesha (the Holy Prophet's wife) rebell against the
successorof the Holy Prophet (s), i.e. Ali ibn Abi Talib (a),
while it is said in aclear hadith that whoever rebels against the
Imam of his time, he shall beconsidered rebellious and
irreligious?! Was not her rebellion against Amiral-Muminin in
al-Jamal battle a frank contracdiction to the Quranic
texts,especially the well-known verse, "And stay in your
houses..."[Holy QuranXXXIII:33]?
Didn't the Holy Prophet (s) say, "O Ali! whosoever fights against
you,he is like that who fights against me; and whosoever makes
peace withyou, then he is making peace with me"? Now,
according to this holytradition, were not Mu`awiyah, `Ayesha,
Talha, and al-Zubayr fightingagainst the Holy Prophet (s) when
they rebelled against Imam Ali (a)?
Can we not discover the source of disputes by reading history and
studyits events? Those disputes which were the main reasons for the divisionof the Islamic ummah.
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="75%">
<p></p><h3>Question No.6</h3>
<p align="justify">Can anyone who accompanied the Holy Prophet (s) and saw
him beconsidered a just sahaabi?
There is no doubt that anyone who acompanied the Holy Prophet
(s)is considered a companion. The companions were very
fortunatebecause they have seen the Holy Prophet (s) and
benefitted from hisholy existence and spirituality. But, at the same
time, we have to say thatthis accompaniment does not protect the
companion from falling in thewrong, and it cannot be anyone's
ticket to enter paradise. Rather, truebelief in Allah, good deeds,
and adhering to the Islamic shari`ah is thereal security. This is
clear from the holy verses, especially the surah ofal-`Asr.
We don't have in our hand any hadith or narration confiring that
anyonewho accompanied the Holy Prophet (s) is infallible or
just, or evenpious. On the contrary, we have many verses
declaring that some of the Holy Prophet's companions were
hypocrite and they remained on theirhypocrisy until they died.
Thus, the opinion which says that all the HolyProphet's
companions are just, and that they must be obeyed isabsolutely
incorrect, rather it contradicts the Holy Quran. How can weregard
all the companions to be just and that they must be followed,while
some of them have accused the Holy Prophet's wife of having
anillegal relationship?! This event has been mentioned in the Holy
Quran inthe surah of al-Noor, verse 11. Some other companions
were drunkards,like Qudamah ibn Madh`oon who had been
punished for this act. Walidibn `Uqbah was also a companion
about whom the following Quranicverse had been revealed: "O
you who believe! if an evil-doer comes toyou with a report, look
carefully into it, lest you harm a people inignorance" [al-Hujurat:6].
Other companions had committed adultry!(See: Usd al-Ghaabah,
vol. 4&amp;5, where you can get more informationabout their names
and shameful biography in details). How can weadhere to any
companion, while at the same time when we find
outrightcontradictions between what they say and what they do.
This is besidethe mental, dogmatic, and political disputes that had
happened betweenthe companions themselves? When Abdul
Rahman ibn `Awf said to ImamAli (a) in the gathering when
`Umar was dying: I swear allegiance toyou according to the Quran,
the sunnah of the Prophet, and the way oflife of the two caliphs.
Imam Ali (a) said,"No! I accept your allegianceaccording to the
Quran, the sunnah of the Prophet, and my opinion!"This means
that Imam Ali (a) didn't agree to follow the way of life ofthe two caliphs.</p><p align="justify">
Thus, we can ask that:</p><p align="justify">
1- Does investigating the companions' biographies and way of
lifecontradict the Holy Quran? The Holy Quran itself discloses
many factsand unveils many characters, the following verses are
examples: (1) "Thedwellers of the desert are very hard in unbelief
and hypocrisy, and moredisposed not to know the limits of what
Allah has revealed to HisApostle; and Allah is Knowing, Wise"; (2)
"And of the dwellers of thedesert are those who take what they
spend to be a fine, and what theywait (the befalling of) calamities
to you; on them (will be) the evilcalamity"; (3) "And of the dwellers
of the desert are those who believe inAllah and the latter day and
take what they spend to be (means of) thenearness of Allah"; (4)
"And as for the foremost, the first of the Muhajirsand the Ansars...
and from among those who are round about you of thedwellers of
the desert there are hypocrites, and from among the peopleof
Medina(also); they are stubborn in hypocrisy; you do not know
them;We know them; We will chastise them twice, then shall they
be turnedback to a grievous chastisement" [Tawbah:98-100].
In other Quranic verses we see that the names of some of
thecompanions have been mentioned in the Holy Quran. In these
versesthey have been considered irreligious, like Walid ibn
`Uqbah about whomthe Holy Quran has said,"O you who believe! if
an evil-doer comes toyou with a report, look carefully into it, lest
you harm a people inignorance" [al-Hujurat:6]. The narrations of
Sunni sources have disclosedthe name of this person whom the
Quran is making reference too. Anarration had been mentioned in
the Sahih of al-Bukhari (the book ofdu`as, a chapter on
al-Hawdhöthe poolö) declares the Holy Prophet (s) had said,"I am
your missing baby near the pool. There, some menwill be lifted
unto me, but when I come down to lift them up, they will
bescattered around me! At that time, I will say, `O my Lord! these
are mycompanions!' He will answer me saying, `You don't know
what they didafter you!'</p><p align="justify">
Many traditions have been narrated in The Sunni sources
(Sahihal-Bukhari that are having such meaning - a chapter on
al-Hawdhöthepoolö, vol.8, pp.13,504,505.)
It is incorrect to look at all the companions with one eye; this is in
factopposite of the Holy Quran. The truth is that many of the Holy
Prophet'scompanions were pious and true believers, while there
were some whowere known for their false belief and hypocrisy.
History shows us manyexamples of such individuals.</p><p align="justify">
2- Is it correct to close our eyes and ears, saying that all the
companionswere pious, good, and that all of their deeds were
credible even if theyhad some deeds which were opposed to the
Islamic law (shar`)?</p><p align="justify">
3- Is it right to justify their evil deeds, saying that they were
practisingijtihad, and that their wrong doings did not happen
intentionally?
If they were free to practise ijtihad, why can't we also practise
ijtihad?Why is it that some say: You are kafir (an infidel)! if you
practise ijtihad?Why do you consider all those who criticizes the
companions accordingto the Holy Quran, kafirs? One of the Hanafi
scholars, Ibn `Abdeen, hadmade a nice statement, saying,
"Considering others as kafirs withoutevidences is the behaviour of
the pagans not the mujtahids!"</p><p align="justify">
4- Can we call this behaviour of yours but extremity and
exaggeration?How could you accuse others of exaggeration and
forget to criticizeyourselves? We haven't any evidence that the
companions of the HolyProphet (s) were infallible, but when you
talk about their deeds youtalk exaggeratedly, and even at times,
you consider the companionseven better than an infallible or the
Holy Prophet (s) himself. However,when the Shi`ites speak
about their Imams as infallible imamas, youaccuse them of
fabrication and lies! Many Sunni scholars have dared tosay that
many Quranic verses were revealed according to `Umar's will.Yes,
these words have been written by a Sunni scholar under the
title"Muwafaqaat `Umar".</p><p align="justify">
The Sunni people perform the prayers known as "taraweeh"
inRamadhan in congregation, while it is an inovation fabricated by
`Umar.Was such a prayer mention in the sunnah of the Holy
Prophet (s)?When the Shi`ites practise their deeds according
to Imam Sadiq'ssayings and narrations, the Sunni people say that
the Shi`ites refer theirdeeds to their Imams because they are
ma`soom, while they (the Sunnis)give a better rank to a companion
than the rank of the Holy Prophet (s). This clearly dicloses their
contradictions.</p><p align="justify">
It is better for those who accuse the shi`ites of untrue
performance tolook to their beliefs and sayings?
What a beautiful saying that Imam Ali (a) said: "The lover of a
thing isblind and deaf."
What are the basis upon which Mu`wiyah depended to practise
ijtihad -eventually causing him to wage a savage war against Imam
Ali (a); thewar which caused many eminent companions to die?
It is not logical to interpret some Quranic verses like,"You are best
of thenations raised up for (the benefit of) men," or "And thus We
have madeyou a medium (just) nation," etc..., that they are
describing thecompanions and their being just and equal. This is
because it is clearthat these verses and others are talking about
the whole ummah notcertain individuals. For example, when it is
says that the inhabitants ofthe so city are bettere than others, the
whole inhabitants of that city areincluded in this expression -
generally speaking, not necessarily meaningeach of them.
Anyhow, a person may be pious in the lifetime of the Holy Prophet
(s)and it is possible that he changes his behaviours after his
(the Prophet's)demise. This is exactly what happened and what the narrations havetold.
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="75%">
<p></p><h3>Question No.7</h3>
<p align="justify">What are the references and sources from which we can identify
the Holy Prophet's sunnah?.</p><p align="justify">
Allah, the Exalted, said, "... and whatever the Apostle gives you,
accept it,and from whatever he forbids you, keep back..."</p><p align="justify">
1- All the Islamic sects agree on the prophetic sunnah - no one has
doubt in it. The dispute is in regard to the sources of this prophetic
sunnah. Both the Shi`ites and Sunnis have narrated the well-known
tradition intheir books in which the Holy Prophet (s) said, "I am
leaving with you two weighty things (Thaqalayn); if you adhered to
them, you won't bemisguided at all. They are the Book of Allah
and my family. They won't separate from each other until they
arrive to me near the Pool."</p><p align="justify">
All sects have agreed on the chain of this hadith. Ibn Hajar, a
Sunninarrator, has said, "This tradition has been conveyed by
more than 20 companions. It is also mentioned in the sahih of
Muslim, sunan of al-Daarimi, musnad Ahmad, and tens of sources.
This clearly makes indicates that the Holy Prophet (s) had
shown us how to derive hissunnah and from which sources. There
is no doubt that the main sourceof the Prophet's (s) sunnah is
the Aalul Bayt (a). However, at the same time we see that the
Sunni ulama do not paying any attention to this sahih hadith. Why?
Is the Prophet's hadith insufficient.</p><p align="justify">
2- Why do they follow the other tradition which says,"...the Book of
Allahand my sunnah"? Now, suppose that the Holy Prophet (s)
did wordthis tradition in this fashion, does it differ with the first
one? Ibn Hajar hadsaid that the Islamic ummah needs the Holy
Quran, the sunnah, andAhlul Bayt (a). If we examin the text we
shall be quite sure that itconfirms the infallibility of the Imams and
that they are unique intellectualsand political sources. Hence, we
have no other choice but to adhere tothem because they are the
firmest link handle between us, Allah and HisProphet (s).
The Sunnis believe that the traditions and the sunnah have not
beenrecorded for about a century, i.e. from the caliphate of `Umar
till thecaliphate of `Umar ibn Abdil Aziz (the Umayyad caliph). Many
traditionshave been burned in the lifetime of Abu Bakr and Umar.</p><p align="justify">
3- Can we expect any remaining of the trdaitions and sunnah after
acentury of prohibition? Even if we found some of them, we
should askhow much and to what degree of accuracy were they
recorded? Do wedare say that all the traditions existing in the
Sunni sources remainedsafe from abrogation? And, if those
traditions were all accredited andreliable, then why did Muslim
choose only six thousand hadith fromabout three hundred
thousand? Or why did al-Bukhari choose only fourthousand
hadiths from more than six hundred thousand - and left therest?
If all the traditions that are talking about the Prophet (s) and
hissunnah were reliable and trustworthy then why do the Sunnis
practiseijtihad, qiyas and istihsan? Wasn't Abu Hanifa, and other
scholarspractising qiyas and istihsan in order to derive certain
rules of the Islamiclaw (shar`)? Doesn't this prove that the
traditions do not contain religiousrules? Even those which contain
some religious rule, are not reliable. Weread in the book titled
"Kitaab al-Mawdhou`aat" (vol.1, Beirut edition, thelast lines of the
chapter called `fadhaa`il al-Khulafa'') that the two greatand eminent
scholars, i.e. al-Soyouti and Ibn al-Jawzi, had declared thatmost of
the known narrations which eulogize the caliphs are fabricatedand
not trustworthy!</p><p align="justify">
4- Prohibiting the writing of the traditions led the enemies of Ahlul
Bayt(a) to omit all these traditions containing the virtues of the
Prophet'sHouse, and in their place they fabricated thousands of
traditions thateulogize their enemies! (See the first volume of
tafseer al-Fakhral-Raaziöa great Sunni scholaröwhen interpreting the
phrase "BismAllah"; he says: The traditionalists have concealed
many traditions thatrelated the virtues of Imam Ali (a) because
they feared Mu`awiyah!!!</p><p align="justify">
5- If the Sunnis are true when they pretend that the Muslims have
tofollow the sunnah of the Holy Prophet (a), then why do they
refuse tonarrate the traditions that eulogize the Holy Imams (a),
especially ImamSadiq (a). This is so, while in the same time
they narrate manytraditions about the Khawarij and Nawasib. For
example, Bukhaarinarrated in his sahih, from `Imran ibn Hittan (a
khariji).</p><p align="justify">
6- Why do Sunnis narrate most of the traditions through the chain
of AbuHurayra? It is said that the number of traditions narrated by
Abu Hurayraare about 5,374, while Abu Hurayra didn't accompany
the Holy Prophet(s) except in the last two years of the Holy
Prophet's lifetime - afteraccepting Islam.
As for Imam Ali (a), who accompanied the Holy Prophet (s)
sincehis childhood until the Holy Prophet (s) died between his
hands, thereare only 537 traditions narrated from him (a) in
Sunnis books. This isso, while Imam Ali (a) delivered the most
remarkable orations andsayings especially during the time which
he ruled over the Muslimummah, which lasted less than five years.
And in this five years heexplained to the Muslims every minute rule
and regulation in the Islamicshari`ah and the prophetic sunnah.
None of these orations and sayingshas been mentioned in the
sahih of al-Baukhari or Muslim.</p><p align="justify">
7- Didn't the Holy Prophet (s) say, "I am the city of knowledge,
and Aliis its gate"; "I am the house of wisdom and Ali is its gate";
"Ali is withtruth and truth is with Ali", etc... Are these not clear
proofs that show thehigh rank of Imam Ali (a)?</p><p align="justify">
8- Weren't Ali (a), Fatima (a) and their sons al-Hasan and
al-Husayn (a) the people about whom the verse of "tatheer" and
"mubahala" hadbeen revealed?</p><p align="justify">
9- What is the meaning of "loving the Household of the Holy
Prophet (s)"? Their love can be verified by two means, first:</p><p align="justify">
speaking andmentioning their virtues in gatherings of those with
true faith, andsecond: adhering to them by word and act, as the
Holy Prophet (s)had said, "if you adhered to them, you won't be
misguided at all." Canone love the Aalul Bayt (a) only by words
instead of heart?</p><p align="justify">
10- Is it logical that the Muslims follow any individual, even if
thatindividual was like Mu`awiyah who was known for his enmity
againstAalul Bayt (a)? Can't we consider this following as an
open enmityagainst the Aalul Bayt (a) and the Holy Quran?
The Holy Quran had clearly mentioned that loving the Aalul Bayt
(a) isthe cause of receiving a great reward; thus, is it right to
follow anyfabricated hadith or to call the Muslims to follow
individuals likeMu`awiyah who is not infallible. He is the one who
had committed lots ofmistakes and crimes against Islam and its
regulations. The most wickedamong Mu`awiyah's deeds is his
warfare against Imam Ali (a) and thewicked ritual - enacted by
him - to insult Imam Ali (a) on the pulpit inevery part of the
Islamic country - this lasted until the ruling time of theUmayyad
caliph `Umar ibn Abdil `Aziz. It is worthy to mention that the Holy
Prophet (s) had already said, "Whosoever enacts a wicked
ritual,then the penalty of enacting such a ritual shall be on him and those whofollow this ritual."
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="75%">
<p></p><h3>Question No.8</h3>
<p>When did the Sunni Sects Exist?
</p><p align="justify">It is certain that there was nothing called "Sunni sects" in the
lifetime ofthe Holy Prophet (s), not even after his demise. The
Sunni sects haveemerged in the 3rd and 4th centuries (Hijri) as a
result of political anddogmatic differences. Some of those sects
have been abrogated andother were authorized.
We have here some questions in regard to this subject:</p><p align="justify">
1- Why were some of those sects authroized and other were
rejected?Are there any Quranic evidences and demonstrations, or
prophetictraditions that urge us to follow, for example, the Hanafi
or Maaliki sect?Weren't the founders of the rejected sects
mujtahids? If so, hasn't anymujtahis the right to disclose his own
opinion, like Abu Hanifa whopractised ijtihad - which he remained
doing so till the end of his life?</p><p align="justify">
2- Were the four famous sects existing in the time of the caliphs?
Werethe caliphs performing their duties and judging people
according to theirown opinions?
We can notice the great difference between the Sunnis in the time
of theUmayyad, Abbasid, and the Ottoman dynasties, and
between the Sunnisin present time, especially in regard to issues
of fiqh and beliefs.</p><p align="justify">
3- Can we trust those traditions fabricated by the oppressive
Umayyad,Abbasid and Ottoman caliphs; traditions which were
fabricated in theirown benefit and to keep them in power -
traditions which were cosider tobe the exact words of the Holy
Prophet (s)?</p><p align="justify">
4- Can we regard all the savage behaviours of the partisans called
"theArmy of Sahabah" or the Wahhabites as Islamic propagation,
and thatthey are guiding people to the true rules of Islam? Are the
Sunnispropagating the true sunnah of the Holy Prophet (s), or in
fact, theyare propagating the sunnah of the Umayyads and the
Abbasids?</p><p align="justify">
5- Were there any sects in the lifetime of the Holy Prophet (s)?
Allhistorical records confirm that there were not any sects in that
time.Moreover, the term "Sunni" had generated in the time of
Mu`awiyah andlater on.</p><p align="justify">
6- Wasn't the belief of the determinists declaring that man must
obey hisruler, no matter whether he (i.e. the ruler) was just or
oppressor? Wasn'tthe opinion that "all the companions are just"
derived from the falsetraditions which Mu`awiyah and the
Umayyads had generated?</p><p align="justify">
7- Is it correct to return to the old texts of a person who died
centuriesago, to derive new issues?</p><p align="justify">
8- Why do the Sunnis return to persons who died 13 centuries ago
whilethey can consult contemporary scholars (faqihs) and eminent
`ulamawho have obtained high ranks not less than those who have
pasted?</p><p align="justify">
Why isn't there any scholar (mujtahid) among the Sunnis who can
savethem from disputes and answer their religious questions of
the day, whilethe Shi`ites have many scholars in every time and
place?</p><p align="justify">
Is the present knowledge and science the same as the knowledge
andscience of past times? Are the needs of our communities
today the sameas those which were existing 1,300 years ago?
9- Why don't the Sunnis follow the fatwa of the shaykh
MahmoudShaltoot, the dean al-Azhar who considered Shi`ism as
an authorizedsect, as he says it depends on the intellectual and
fiqh bases? Isn't thata clear religious prejudice? Is not Shi`ism the
right sect which is basedon that which the Holy Prophet (s) had
recommended? Wasn't thefamous tradition (i.e., "I am leaving with
you two weighty things(Thaqalayn); if you adhered to them, you
won't be misguided at all. Theyare the Book of Allah and my
family") sufficient to follow the Shi`a sect?Have you any other
evidences to prove the correctness of the famousfour sects?
Surely the answer will be "NO"! If you study the Shi`a bookswithout
partisanship or prejudice, you will certainly not find any kind
ofcontradictions and you will notice that they are not forging lies
againstanyone. However, we may find some Sunnis when they
want toinvestigate other sects and their beliefs, they depend only
on their ownscholars' (shaykhs') speeches and opinions without
paying any attentionto the ideas of the `ulama of the other sects. Is
it correct to follow suchmethodology to investigate another sects' teachings?
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="75%">
<p></p><h3>Question No.9</h3>
<p align="justify">What is the Sunnis' attitude in regard to the revolution of Imam Husayn (a)?
Every body recognize the high rank of Imam Husayn (a).
Hisgrandfather is the Holy Prophet (s). The Holy Prophet (s)
wasalways describing Imam Husayn (a), that he is the
counter-balance ofthe Holy Quran. And in other tradition he (s)
declared that Husayn ibnAli (a) shall always remain an Imam
whether he rises (rebelled againstthe oppressors) or not. He (s)
also insisted that the Muslims shouldlove Imam Husayn (a) and
adhere to his teachings. Anyhow, it iswell-known that Imam Husayn
(a) is the best person of his era after hisfather and elder brother.
As it is known that Imam Husayn had rose up against the authority
ofYazid ibn Mu`awiyah to fulfill his duty toward the Holy Quran and
his Holygrandfather (s) when he noticed that the Umayyad
caliphs hadexceeded the limits of Islam with their oppression and
injustice. ImamHusayn (a) followed the tradition of his
grandfather, namely, "He whosees an oppressor and tyrant ruler,
who is changing what is forbidden(haram) into what is allowed
(halal) - those who broke their covenantwith Allah and fight against
the sunnah of the Holy Prophet (s). And inthe face of this he
doesn't try to contest or protest against that ruler'sillegal deeds
neither by speech nor by action, Allah shall put him in thesame
place where He shall put that tyrant."
Some of the chiefs in Kufa announced that they would assist
ImamHusayn (a) and promised to help him in letters that they
wrote toImam Husayn (a) while he was in Medina. At the same
time, some ofthe companions, whom the Sunnis are still eulogize,
like Abdullah ibn`Umar, Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr, Abdul Rahman ibn
Abi Bakr and manyothers, didn't give their allegiance to Imam
Husayn (a). We should askwhy? Moreover, abdullah ibn `Umar
began calling the people to payallegiance to Yazid, preventing
them from assisting Imam Husayn (a)!This had been recorded
by al-Bukhari (vol.IX, the book of riots, chapter:`if he said anything
before the folk'), and in musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal(vol.II, p.48)
[This narration was conveyed by Naafi`].
Now, we ask this question from the Sunnis: Do you disagree with
ImamHusayn's uprising? If we search in historical records we shall
come tothe conclusion that the Sunnis had preferred silence and
agreed to bewith those who remained behind. But all of us know
that whosoeverremains silent - not support his Imam (a),
knowing that the Imam, theson of the Holy Prophet (s) is right -
agrees with Yazid and his wickeddeeds. Thus, these people shall
be considered as those who haveparticipated with Yazid's army
and fought against Imam Husayn (a)and were indirect partners
in the massacres of Yazid's army on the dayof `Ashoora.
In fact, the rule of Yazid over the Islamic emperor was the
continuation of`Umar, `Uthman, and Mu`awiyah rule.
Didn't Mu`awiyah fight against Ali (a), and therefore the main
factor ofImam Hasan's martyrdom? Didn't he submit the key of
caliphate to hisinsane son Yazid, and by doing so breaking the
covenants he gave toImam Hasan (a)?</p><p align="justify">
We put these questions in front of those who assisted Yazin and
stoodwith him. Those who remained behind and abandoned Imam
Husayn(a) in the hour of straitness, when he rose against oppression andcorruption.
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="75%">
<p></p><h3>Question No.10</h3>
<p align="justify">Some commentaries on the Sunni Islamic laws (fiqh):
</p><p align="justify">Every sect has its own rules and regulations, and it is indisputable
thatthe imam of that sect had derived those rules and regulations
by meansof ijtihad. However, we still find some rules in Sunni fiqh
that have nolegal or logical base. The most wonderful matter here
is that the Sunnisinsist on following those baseless rules which
sometimes arecontradictory to the texts of the Holy Quran and the
prophetic traditions.Here are some of those rules:</p><p align="justify">
1- Regrading (wudhu) abolution, the Holy Quran says, "... and wipe
yourheads and your feet to the ankles"; this part of the verse is
acontinuation of the first part which is "wash your faces and your
hands",so, why do the Sunnis wash their feet - contrary to the
meaning of theverse?</p><p align="justify">
2- All Sunni sects do not consider performing prayer (salat) with
thearms folded across each other as an obligation in the prayer,
however,they still insist on performing it. Even some famous
sects, like Shafi`ee,does not regard that as obligatory, and they
sometimes pray with openarms (with their arms to their sides); so
why does other sects insist onpraying with folded arms?</p><p align="justify">
3- All narrations and historical record show that in the early times
ofIslam, the Nabawi Masjid was not furnished with carpet, rather,
theMuslims were performing their prayers on the bare ground,
andsometimes on plants that were not eaten or woven (into
cloths). We haveno truthful tradition that mentioned that the
Prophet (s) had called theMuslims to perform their prayers on
carpets or the like of it. Why then doyou insist on performing
prayers on carpets and fabrics in spite of themany narrations
(written in your books too) that refer to performpostration (sojood)
on the bare ground? Why do you blame the Shi`a forprostrating on
a piece of clay? Isn't prostrating on the ground one of
theProphet's sunnah? Can you verify that prostrating on carpet
andgarments was his (s) sunnah?
We hope to receive the answer for these questions from the
learned andwise men.</p><p align="justify">
4- One of Islam's obligatory duties is the five daily prayers,
andwhosoever denies them is considered a kafir. Each prayer has
its ownand mutual time. Many Sunni and Shi`ite narrations have
declared thatthe Holy Prophet (s) on many occasions, and had
performed - manytimes, the noon prayers in the beginning of the
noon, and in other timeshe (s) performed it in the afternoon. He
did the same thing with thelate evening (maghrib) and `isha
prayers. It is also narrated that the HolyProphet (s) had
performed the five prayers with in three times frames,with or
without reasons - he only wanted to remove all kinds of
burdensfrom his ummah.</p><p align="justify">
Why do the Sunnis insist on not performing some of the prayers
togetherat one time, which has been permitted by the Prophet
(s)? Isn't thisclear contradiction to the Holy Quran "and has not
laid upon you anyhardship in religion", and the holy sunnah?
Isn't the tradition narrated from Imam Sadiq (a) which declares
that itis permissible to perform some prayers together at one time
accordingto the holy verse "Keep up prayers from the declining of
the sun till thedarkness of the night"?</p><p align="justify">
5- Why don't the Sunnis repeat the sentence "hayya `ala khayr
al-`amal"although it is recommended, and in its place they added
"al-salaatkhayrun min al-nawm" which has no legal evidence to
support it?</p><p align="justify">
6- There is no doubt that the prayers have lots of benefits and
rewardsfor anyone who performs them, especially the
congregational prayers -when a pious and just imam leads it. So,
why do the Sunnis perform thecongregational prayers behind any
individual (no matter whether he isirreligious, injust, oppressive or
he was not)? Do you think that this ispermissible in Islam?</p><p align="justify">
7- It is known among the Muslims that the obligatory prayers must
beperformed in congregation, while the mustahabb prayers can
beperformed alone. Umar himself confess that this issue is true.
So, fromwhere did he bring the prayers of taraawih? Why did he
oblige theMuslims to perform it in congregation? He has then
inovated a heresy:Obliging the people to perform the mustahabb
prayers in congregationand insisting on that. He announced that
anyone who does not performthe obligatory prayers in
congregation, must perform the taraawihprayers in congregation.
Is this correct?!</p><p align="justify">
8- The Holy Prophet (s) encourged the Muslims to get married
andsaid that this is a part of his sunnah. And to save this
sacredrelationship, Islam legislated lots of rules and regulations.
An example ofthose rules is that Islam prohibited forced divorces.
To perform the legal divorce ceremony, there must be two
witnessesbefore the judge during the three times of divorce. After
the third divorcethe relationship shall absolutely be cut! The Hanafi
sect, however, doesnot care for the husband's psychological
situation. In this sect it ispermissible for the man to divorce his
wife three time orally, only bysaying the phrase by which man
divorces his wife: "I divorce you (threetimes)."
Now, does not this fatwa bring about difficulty (in remaining
married)while the Holy Quran says, "and has not laid upon you any
hardship inreligion"?</p><p align="justify">
The above question was the last to the Sunni brothers, although
thereare many more to be asked. However, we shall suffice with
what wehave asked, hoping that the learned researchers will
continue theirstruggle for aquiring the truth.
