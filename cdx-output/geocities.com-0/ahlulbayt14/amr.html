<p align="justify">We know that the difference between falling down from a roof-top and coming
down by ladders. The second act is done by our own power, will and 
intention; while the falling down is not so. And we know that our actions 
are not like falling down from the roof-top; instead they are like coming 
down the ladder with our own will and power. Therefore, what we do are our 
own actions and should not be attributed solely to Allah.
</p><p align="justify">Again, we see that there are some of our actions for which we are either 
praised or blamed, while for other happenings we are neither praised nor condemned.
It clearly shows that:<br><br>
</p><li>the First category is within our power and will, and
</li><li>the second category is beyond our will and power.
<p align="justify">For example, we
may be advised to treat an ailment in this or that way, but we cannot be 
advised to recover from the illness. It means that getting treatment is 
within our power, but getting well is not within the sphere of our activities.
</p><p align="justify">Therefore, we say that there are many things and aspects of life which are 
within our power and will, while some others are not within our power, Those 
things for which we can be advised praised or blamed, are within our power 
and will. And the commandments of religion come under this 
category, because we have been advised or ordered to do this and not to do 
that, and because we are praised when we obey those commands and blamed when 
we disobey them. Therefore, it is absolutely wrong to say that our sins and 
righteousness, our obedience and disobedience, our true beliefs and wrong 
belief are by decree of Allah and His desire and will.  Shaikh al-Saduq 
said: "Allah possesses foreknowledge of human actions, but does not compel 
them to act in any particular manner"
</p><p align="justify">But neither does this mean that man is completely independent of Allah. In 
fact, the power and will to act as we like is given to us by Allah. Thus Imam Jafar al-Sadiq  said:
There is no compulsion (by Allah),
nor is there absolute delegation of power (from Allah to man); but
the real position is between these two extremes, al-amr bayna a1-amryan.
</p><p align="justify">The following example clearly portrays this "middle position". Suppose a
man's hand is totally paralyzed to an extent that he cannot move even a 
finger A doctor has fitted an electrical device on his hand which, on being 
switched on, enables the man to use his hand freely in a normal way. The 
device is activated by a remote control which the doctor keeps in his own 
custody. When the doctor switches the device on, the man uses his hand in 
any way he intends, but when the device is off, he cannot do anything. Now 
if the device is on and the patient does any work, can that work be 
attributed independently to him? No because the power comes from that device 
which is fully controlled by the doctor, Then can it be attributed to the 
doctor? No, because the man had done it by his own free will and choice. 
This is exactly the position of our activities. We are not under compulsion 
because the will and choice is ours; nor are we completely independent, 
because the power to do whatever we intend to do comes from God.
And at what point does our ability to do things start?
</p><p align="justify">Imam Musa al-Kazim said:
A man acquires that ability when four conditions are fulfilled:</p><ul>
<li>when there is nothing to hinder his plans;
</li><li>his health,
</li><li>the faculties (needed for that work) are up to the requied standard; and
</li><li>Allah provides him the occasion of that work.
When all these conditions are fulfilled, a man becomes capable of acting according to his own free will.
</li></ul>
<p align="justify">When asked for an example, the Imam said:
Let us suppose that there is a
man, without any hindrance, of good health and proper strength; yet he 
cannot commit adultery unless he finds a woman. When he gets a woman (and 
the fourth condition is fulfilled), then it is up to him to choose one of 
the two alternatives: either he controls his evil emotions and saves himself 
as (Prophet) Yusuf  did, or he commits adultery. If he 
protects himself from that sin, it will not be by compulsion of Allah (as 
some people think). And if he commits the sin, it does not mean that he was 
above the power of Allah (as others think).

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="00bb00"><b>Predestination and the Day of Judgement</b></font>
</p><p></p><hr noshade="" width="80%" size="4">
<p align="justify">According to our point of view, if any one believes in predestination, then
he cannot at the same time believe in the day of judgement (qiyamat). If 
Allah decrees every act which is done by us, then why should He inflict 
punishment upon us for those sins, evils and transgressions, for polytheism, 
disbelief and immoralities which He Himself predestined for us. It will be gross injustice.
</p><p align="justify">
Abu Hanifah once went to meet Imam Jafar al-Sadiq. The Imam was inside his house and Abu Hanifah was
waiting for him to come out. In the meantime, a young came out and Abu 
Hanifah, just to pass some time, asked him, "0 young, from whom is the 
action of man?" The young at once said:
"0 Abu Hanifah, there are only three
imaginable sources: either the man himself is the originator of his action; 
or God is the doer of that action; or both together are the originators of 
that action. Now if God is the doer of the actions of man, then why does He 
inflict punishment on man for the sins? Is it not injustice (zulm)? And 
Allah says, "Verily Allah is not unjust to His creatures." And if both man 
and God are partners in that crime, then is it not gross injustice that the 
powerful partner (i.e., Cod) punishes the weaker partner (i.e., man) for an 
action which both of them performed together? And as these two alternatives 
are proved to be illogical and impossible, the third theory is proved to be 
correct that man does his actions by his own power and will. Abu Hanifah
kissed the forehead of the young. That young was Musa, later known as al-Kazim, the seventh Imam.

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="00bb00"><b>Story of Abu Hanifah and Bahlul</b></font>       
</p><p></p><hr noshade="" width="80%" size="4">
<p align="justify">Abu Hanifah, of course, believed that man does nothing by his own will  and power
inspite of the clever and logical discourse of Imam Musa al-Kazim, 
mentioned above, he did not change his belief. Once his theory led to a tragic-comic event.
</p><p align="justify">Bahlul means wise and chief. It was the name of a famous companion of Imam 
Jafar al-Sadiq who lived up to the last days of Imam Ali al-Naqi and saw 
Imam Hasan al-'Askari also. As a twist of fate, he is commonly referred to 
as Bahlul al-Majnun (Bahlul, the lunatic). This is so because he pretended to 
be insane in order to save himself from the responsibilities of judgeship 
offered to him by the Caliph Harun al-Rashid. But, wise as he was, he took 
advantage of his supposed lunacy and always censued great people of his 
time (including the kings) for their short-comings.
</p><p align="justify">Once he heard Abu Hanifah telling his disciples 
that," I have heard three things from Imam Jafar al-Sadiq which I think are 
wrong." The disciples asked what those things were. Abu Hanifah said:</p><ul><li>
First of all, Imam Jafar al-Sadiq says that Allah cannot be seen. But it 
is wrong. If a thing does exist, then it must be seen.</li><li>
Secondly, he says that Satan will be punished in Hell. But it is absurd. Because Satan was 
created from fire: how can fire do any harm to a thing or person made of fire?
</li><li>Thirdly, he says that a man's action is done by his will and power,
and that he is responsible for it. But it is wrong because all the actions 
of man are done by Allah's will and power, and Allah is, actually, responsible for it.</li></ul>
<p align="justify">The disciples applaud had just begun when Bahlull took a lump of clay and 
sent it hurtling towards Abu Hanifah. It hit him on the forehead, he cried 
in anguish and pain. The disciples caught Bahlul, and Abu Hanifah took him  to the judge.
The judge heard the complaint and asked Bahlul whether the allegation was  true.
</p><p align="justify">Bahlul: "0 Judge! Abu Hanifah alleges that he is suffering from a 
searing pain in his head because of the clay which hit him. But I think he 
is lying. I cannot believe him until I see the pain."
</p><p align="justify">Abu Hanifah: "You really are mad! How can I show you the pain? Has anybody ever seen a pain?"
</p><p align="justify">Bahlul: "But 0 Judge, he was just teaching his disciples that if a thing 
does exist, then it must be seen. As he cannot show the pain, I submit that 
according to his own belief, he is not suffering from any pain at all"
</p><p align="justify">Abu Hanifah: "Oh! my head is splitting because of the pain."
</p><p align="justify">Bahlul: "0 Judge, there is another matter which I just remembered. He was 
also telling his disciples that as Satan is made of fire, the fire of Hell 
cannot do him any harm. Now man is made of clay, as the Quran says, and it 
was a lump of clay which hit him. I wonder how can he claim that a lump of 
Clay did harm to a man made of clay?"
</p><p align="justify">Abu Hanifah: "0 Judge! Bahlul wants to go Scot free by his verbosity. Please, take my revenge from him."
</p><p align="justify">Bahlul: "0 Judge, I think  Abu Hanifah has very wrongfully brought me in 
this court. He was just teaching his disciples that all the actions of man 
are done by Allah, and that Allah is responsible for those actions. Now, why 
did he bring me here? if he really is suffering from the effect of that lump 
of clay, he should file suit against Allah who did hit him with that clay. 
Why should a poor harmless person like me be brought to the court. When all 
I am supposed to do was in fact done by Allah?".
</p><p>The judge acquitted Bahlul.</p><p></p><hr size="4" noshade="" width="80%"><center><b>
