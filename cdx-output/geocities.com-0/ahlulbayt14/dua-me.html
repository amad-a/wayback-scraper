with the help of all the Names whereby Thou hast named Thyself, or which Thou hast sent
down in any of Thy inspired Scriptures, or Which Thou hast inscribed in Thy knowledge of

the unknown; and (I beseech Thee) in the name of the honored and exalted positions of Thy

Throne, and in the name of the utmost extent of Thy Mercy as expressed in Thy Book (the

Quran) and in the name of that which If all the trees on earth were to become pens

and all the seven seas ink, the Words of Allah could not be fully written down.

Verily Allah is the Honored, the Wise; And I beseech Thee with the help of Thy

Beautiful Names which Thou has praised in Thy Book, saying,:Unto Allah belong the

beautiful names -- so call ye Him by Them; And Thou hast said Call unto Me and I
shall answer you; and Thou has said, And when My servants ask something of Me, lo, I

am near, and I grant the prayer of the supplicant when he asks anything of Me, so pray ye

unto Me and believe in Me, that ye may be made perfect; And Thou has said:

</p><p>O My servants who have wronged yourselves, despair not of the Mercy of Allah; verilly Allah forgiveth all the sins; verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.

</p><p>Therefore I pray unto Thee,
</p><p>My God, and I ask Thee,
</p><p>My Cherisher and Sustainer, and I hope from Thee,
</p><p>My Chief, and I crave Thy acceptance of my prayer,

</p><p>O my Protector, even as Thou hast promised me, and I call upon Thee even as Thou hast commanded me -- So, do unto me what pleases Thee to do,
</p><p>O Generous One!
</p><p>(Here the Devotee should pray for the fulfillment of his valid desires.)
</p><p>And all Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds, and the blessings of Allah be upon The Holy Prophet Mohammad and his Ahlul-Bayt.
