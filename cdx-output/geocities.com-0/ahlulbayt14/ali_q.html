<p><b><font color="red" size="8">The Holy Quran</font></b></p></center>
<p></p><hr noshade="" width="85%">
<p align="justify"><b><font color="blue" size="5">Imam Ali said:</font></b>
</p><p align="justify">

</p><p align="justify">And know that this Quran is an adviser who never deceives, a leader who never misleads and a
narrator who never speaks a lie. No one will sit beside this Quran but that when he rises he will
achieve one addition or one diminution - addition in his guidance or elimination in his (spiritual)
blindness. You should also know that no one will need anything after (guidance from) the Quran
and no one will be free from want before (guidance from) the Quran. Therefore, seek cure from it
for your ailments and seek its assistance in your distresses. It contains a cure for the biggest
diseases, namely unbelief, hypocrisy, revolt and misguidance. Pray to Allah through it and turn to
Allah with its love. Do not ask the people through it. There is nothing like it through which the
people should turn to Allah, the Sublime. 

</p><p align="justify">Know that it is an interceder and its intercession will be accepted. It is a speaker who is testified.
For whoever the Quran intercedes on the Day of Judgement, its intercession for him would be
accepted. He about whom the Quran speaks ill on the Day of Judgement shall testify to it. On the
Day of Judgement an announcer will announce, "Beware. every sower of a crop is in distress except
the sowers of the Quran." Therefore, you should be among the sowers of the Quran and its
followers. Make it your guide towards Allah. Seek its advice for yourselves, do not trust your views
against it. and regard your desires in the matter of the Quran as deceitful. 

</p><p align="justify">Then, Allah sent to him [Holy Prophet Mohammad] the Book [Holy Quran] as a light whose flames cannot be extinguished, a lamp whose
gleam does not die, a sea whose depth cannot be sounded, a way whose direction does not
mislead, a ray whose light does not darken, a separator (of good from evil) whose arguments do not
weaken, a clarifier whose foundations cannot be dismantled, a cure which leaves no apprehension
for disease, an honour whose supporters are not defeated, and a truth whose helpers are not
abandoned. Therefore, it is the mine of belief and its centre, the source of knowledge and its oceans,
the plantation of justice and its pools, the foundation stone of Islam and its construction, the valleys
of truth and its plains, an ocean which those who draw water cannot empty, springs which those
who draw water cannot dry up, a watering place which those who come to take water cannot
exhaust, a staging place in moving towards which travellers do not get lost, signs which no treader
fails to see and a highland which those who approach it cannot surpass it. 

</p><p align="justify">Allah has made it a quencher of the thirst of the learned, a bloom for the hearts of religious jurists, a
highway for the ways of the righteous, a cure after which there is no ailment, an effulgence with
which there is no darkness, a rope whose grip is strong, a stronghold whose top is invulnerable, an
honour for him who loves it, a peace for him who enters it, a guidance for him who follows it, an
excuse for him who adopts it, an argument for him who argues with it, a witness for him who
quarrels with it, a success for him who argues with it, a carrier of burden for him who seeks the way,
a shield for him who arms himself (against misguidance), a knowledge for him who listens carefully,
worthy story for him who relates it and a final verdict of him who passes judgements. 

</p><p></p><hr noshade="" width="85%">

<p align="justify">The Quran is a book, covered, between two flaps, and it does not speak. It should therefore necessarily have an
interpreter. Men alone can be such interpreters. When these people invited us to name the Quran as
the arbitrator between us, we could not be the party turning away from the Book of Allah. since
Allah has said: 

</p><p align="justify">. . . And then if ye quarrel about anything refer it to Allah and the Prophet . . (Quran, 4:59) 

</p><p align="justify">Reference to Allah means that we decide according to the Quran while reference to the Prophet
means that we follow his Sunnah. Now therefore, if arbitration were truly done through the Book of
Allah (Quran). we would be the most rightful of all people for the Caliphate; or if it were done by
the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (s), we would be the most preferable of them. 

</p><p></p><hr noshade="" width="85%">

<p align="justify">The fact is that Allah the Glorified says:
</p><p align="justify">. . . We have not neglected anything in the Book (Quran) . . . (Quran, 6:38) 
</p><p align="justify">And says that one part of the Quran verifies another part and that there is no divergence in it as He says: 
</p><p align="justify">. . . And if it had been from any other than Allah, they would surely have found in  it much discrepancy. (Quran, 4 :82) 
</p><p align="justify">Certainly the outside of the Quran is wonderful and its inside is deep (in meaning). Its wonders will
never disappear, its amazements will never pass away and its intricacies cannot be cleared except through itself.
