<p></p><hr noshade="" width="85%">
<p align="justify"><b><font color="blue" size="5">Imam Ali said:</font></b>

</p><p align="justify">Praise is due to Allah whose worth cannot be described by speakers, whose bounties cannot be
counted by calculators and whose claim (to obedience) cannot be satisfied by those who attempt to
do so, whom the height of intellectual courage cannot appreciate, and the divings of understanding
cannot reach; He for whose description no limit has been laid down, no eulogy exists, no time is
ordained and no duration is fixed. He brought forth creation through His Omnipotence, dispersed
winds through His Compassion, and made firm the shaking earth with rocks. 

</p><p align="justify">The foremost in religion is the acknowledgement of Him, the perfection of acknowledging Him is to
testify Him, the perfection of testifying Him is to believe in His Oneness, the perfection of believing in
His Oneness is to regard Him Pure, and the perfection of His purity is to deny Him attributes,
because every attribute is a proof that it is different from that to which it is attributed and everything
to which something is attributed is different from the attribute. Thus whoever attaches attributes to
Allah recognises His like, and who recognises His like regards Him two; and who regards Him two
recognises parts for Him; and who recognises parts for Him mistook Him; and who mistook Him
pointed at Him; and who pointed at Him admitted limitations for Him; and who admitted limitations
for Him numbered Him. 

</p><p align="justify">Whoever said in what is He, held that He is contained; and whoever said on what is He held He is
not on something else. He is a Being but not through phenomenon of coming into being. He exists
but not from non-existence. He is with everything but not in physical nearness. He is different from
everything but not in physical separation. He acts but without connotation of movements and
instruments. He sees even when there is none to be looked at from among His creation. He is only
One, such that there is none with whom He may keep company or whom He may miss in his
absence. 
</p><p></p><hr noshade="" width="85%">

<p align="justify">Praise be to Allah who is proof of His existence through His creation, of His being external through
the newness of His creation, and through their mutual similarities of the fact that nothing is similar to
Him. Senses cannot touch Him and curtains cannot veil Him, because of the difference between the
Maker and the made, the Limiter and the limited and the Sustainer and the sustained. 

</p><p align="justify">He is One but not by the first in counting, is Creator but not through activity or labour, is Hearer but
not by means of any physical organ, is Looker but not by a stretching of eyelids, is Witness but not
by nearness, is Distinct but not by measurement of distance, is Manifest but not by seeing and is
Hidden but not by subtlety (of body). He is Distinct from things because He overpowers them and
exercises might over them, while things are distinct from Him because of their subjugation to Him
and their turning towards Him. 

</p><p align="justify">He who describes Him limits Him. He who limits Him numbers Him. He who numbers Him rejects
His eternity. He who said "how" sought a description for Him. He who said "where" bounded him.
He is the Knower even though there be nothing to be known. He is the Sustainer even though there
be nothing to be sustained. He is the Powerful even though there be nothing to be overpowered.
