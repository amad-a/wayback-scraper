<h1 align="center">Du'a (Supplications) of The Weeks</h1>
<p></p><hr noshade="">
<p></p><h2 align="center">SATURDAY DU'A </h2>
<p></p><hr noshade="">

<p align="justify">Bismillah, which is the creed

of those who seek protection and the motto of those who

want refuge.
</p><p align="justify">I betake me to the Exalted Lord for shelter from the

oppression of tyrants, from the devices of the envious

and from the treachery of the wicked; and praise Him

above the praise of all those who praise.
</p><p align="justify">O Lord, Thou art the One without associate and the king

without being made a king.
</p><p align="justify">Thy command is unopposed and Thy sovereignty undisputed.
I beg Thee to favor Muhammad Thy servant and Thy apostle,

and to inspire me with such gratitude for Thy favors as

would enable me to deserve the utmost extent of Thy

approval; and with Thy loving-kindness help me to serve

Thee and worship Thee regularly and deserve Thy reward.
</p><p align="justify">And favor me by restraining me from acts of disobedience

to Thee as long as Thou keepest me alive; and give me the

grace to do that which would benefit me as long as Thou

sparest me; enlighten my mind with Thy Book and remove

from me the burden of sin because of my reading it; and

favor me by keeping safe my faith and my life; and let

not those that love me be frightened from me; and

continue Thy goodness to me during the rest of my life as

Thou hadst done during the past, O most Merciful!<br>

</p><p></p><hr noshade="">

<p></p><h2 align="center">SUNDAY DU'A </h2>
<p></p><hr noshade="">

<p align="justify">With the name of Allah, besides whose

mercy, I hope for nothing; I fear nothing save His

justice, and trust nothing but His word, and do not cling

but to His string.
</p><p align="justify">To Thee do I beg for shelter, O Lord of forgiveness and

approbation, from tyranny and oppression, from the

changes of time and succession of grief, and from a life

ended without preparation.
</p><p align="justify">And to Thee do I beg for guidance in which there be

reformation and improvement.
</p><p align="justify">And to Thee alone do I pray for help in granting me

success and satisfaction.
</p><p align="justify">And Thee do I request for the garment of safety and the

granting of peace and its permanence.
</p><p align="justify">And I seek Thy protection O Lord, from the suggestions of

Satan, and with Thy power guard myself from the tyranny of kings.
</p><p align="justify">Therefore accept whatever be of my prayers and fasts and

let my morrow and thereafter be better than my present

hour and day; and make me respected amongst my kindred

and community; and guard me in my waking and my sleep;

for Thou art God the best Preserver, and Thou art the

most Merciful.
</p><p align="justify">O Lord, in this my day and on Sundays to follow, I clear

myself in Thy presence of ascribing partners to Thee and

of infidelity, and pray unto Thee sincerely to obtain Thy

answer and render obedience to Thee hoping for Thy reward.
</p><p align="justify">Therefore, bless Muhammad, the best of Thy servants, the

preacher of Thy truth; and honor me with Thy dignity

which cannot be diminished, and watch me with Thy eye

which does not sleep; and finish my affair so as to make

me independent of others and rely on Thee alone, and

terminate my life in forgiveness. Verily, Thou art the

Forgiving, Merciful.
</p><p></p><hr noshade="">

<p></p><h2 align="center">MONDAY DU'A </h2>

<p></p><hr noshade="">

<p align="justify">Praise be to God who called none to
witness when He created the heavens and the earth, and

took no assistance when He created the spirits.

</p><p align="justify">Never had He any partner in His Godhead, nor was He ever

helped in His Oneness.

</p><p align="justify">Tongues are unable to praise Him to the fullest extent,

reason incapable of knowing His essence, the mighty

humble themselves before His Majesty, their faces bent

downward on account of His dread, and all the great

submit to His Glory.

</p><p align="justify">Therefore, unto Thee be all praise in increasing

succession and unbroken continuance. And may His favor be

on His apostle eternally, and peace perpetually, forever.

</p><p align="justify">O Lord, let the first part of this my day consist in

amendment, the middle of it in prosperity, and the last

of it in success.

</p><p align="justify">And through Thee I seek refuge from a day which begins in

fear, the middle of which causes distress, and which ends

in pain.

</p><p align="justify">O Lord, verily I ask Thy pardon for every vow I vowed,

every promise I promised and every covenant I made with

Thee, and then failed to discharge them.

</p><p align="justify">And I pray to Thee concerning wrongs done to Thy

creatures; therefore whichever servant of Thine or

handmaid of Thine has suffered from me any wrong which I

may have done to his person or reputation or property or

kith or offspring, or any slander whereby I may have

spoken ill of him, or anything I may have imposed on him

on account of inclination, or passion, or force,

jealousy, or hypocrisy, or prejudice; he being absent or

present, alive or dead; and, thereafter my hand become

too short and my means too narrow to make amends to him

or obtain his forgiveness; in that case, I beg Thee.... O

Thou who art the Lord of requests (and they are obedient

to Thy will and ready to conform to Thy wish), to confer

favor on Muhammad and his Aal (family) and reconcile him

to me by whatever means Thou choosest, and let me have

mercy from Thee; 

</p><p align="justify">Verily, pardon causes Thee no loss, nor does bounty

injure Thee, O most Merciful.

</p><p align="justify">O Lord, grant me on every Monday two gifts from Thee,

viz. good luck to obey Thee at the beginning of the day,

and the blessing of Thy pardon at the end of it.

</p><p align="justify">O Thou who art the only object of worship, and except

whom none can forgive sins.

</p><p></p><hr noshade="">

<p></p><h2 align="center">TUESDAY DU'A </h2>

<p></p><hr noshade="">

<p align="justify">Praise be to God -- and praise is His due,

as He deserves it -- abundant praise.

</p><p align="justify">I betake me to Him for refuge from mischief of Satan who

adds sin to my sin; and I guard myself through Him from

every wicked tyrant, oppressive king and over-powering enemy.
</p><p align="justify">O Lord let me be of Thy force; for verily Thy forces --

they are victorious and let my be of Thy band, for verily

Thy band they are happy; and make me one of Thy friends,

for surely Thy friends have no fear, nor shall they be sorry.

</p><p align="justify">O Lord reform my faith for me, for verily it is the

safeguard of my affairs and make easy for me my

hereafter, for certainly it will be my place of rest, and

to it will I retire from the company of the wicked.

</p><p align="justify">And let my life be an enhancement of every good to me,

and my death a comfort to me from every evil.

</p><p align="justify">O Lord bless Muhammad, the Last of the Prophets, the one

who concluded the number of the sent ones, and his Aal

(family), the pure, the holy; and his chosen companions;

and in this third day of the week, grant me three things,

viz.: leave me no sin unforgiven and no sorrow unremoved

and no enemy unvanquished by Thee.

</p><p align="justify">With the name of Allah, the best of the names; with the

name of Allah, the Lord of the earth and the heaven, I

drive away every evil, the first of which is His

displeasure; and desire to achieve every good, the

foremost of which is His approval. Therefore let my

existence end in Thy pardon, O Lord of Benevolence!

</p><p></p><hr noshade="">
<p></p><h2 align="center">WEDNESDAY DU'A </h2>

<p></p><hr noshade="">

<p align="justify">Praise be to God who ordained night (to be)
a cover and sleep (to be a mode of) rest; and made

the day (to be the time of) dispersion.

</p><p align="justify">All praise be to Thee for raising me from my sleep, for

had Thou wished so, Thou wouldst have made it

everlasting; a praise perpetual, unceasing and which the

whole of creation would be unable to count.

</p><p align="justify">Praise be to Thee, O Lord, for, Thou didst create, and

didst so with symmetry, and Thou didst measure and

dispose, and causest to die and to live, and makest sick

and restorest to health, and givest safety and dost

afflict, and Thou are exalted above the Arsh (Throne) and

art in full possession of sovereignty.

</p><p align="justify">I pray unto Thee like him whose cause is weak and whose

resource is cut off, and whose death has approached and

whose worldly hope has shrunk, and whose need for Thy

mercy has become pressing, and whose regret for his

default has grown intense, and whose guilt and error has

been too frequent and who repentance unto Thee is

sincere.

</p><p align="justify">Therefore bless Muhammad the Last of the Prophets and the

members of his house, the pure, the holy, and let me have

the intercession of Muhammad -- may Thy favor be on him

and his Aal (family) and do not deprive me of his

company; verily, Thou art the most Merciful.

</p><p align="justify">O Lord, in the fourth day of the week grant me four

things: employ my strength in Thy service; let my delight

consist in Thy worship; make me love Thy reward; and

cause me to abstain from that which would make me

deserving of painful chastisement from Thee. Verily, Thou

art kind to whomsoever Thou willest.

</p><p></p><hr noshade="">

<p></p><h2 align="center">THURSDAY DU'A </h2>

<p></p><hr noshade="">

<p align="justify">All praise be to God who removed the dark

night with His power and brought the bright day with His

mercy; and clothed me with His light and gave me His

blessing.

</p><p align="justify">Therefore, O Lord, since Thou hast kept me alive for this

day, be pleased to spare me for other days similar to it;

and bless Muhammad and his Aal (family) and do not

afflict me in it and in other nights and days for my

having committed guilt; and confer on me its benefit, and

the benefit of what be in it and the benefit of what

follows; and turn away from me its mischief, and the

mischief of what be in it and the mischief of what comes after it.

</p><p align="justify">O Lord, verily I seek adherence unto Thee through the

guarantee of Islam; and rely on Thee through the honor of

the Qur'an; and seek intercession with Thee through

Muhammad, the chosen, may God bless him and his Aal;

therefore, O Lord, recognize my guarantee, whereby I hope

for the satisfaction of my need, O most Merciful!

</p><p align="justify">O Lord, in the fifth day of the week, grant me five

things, which none has power to vouchsafe except Thy

generosity, and which none can afford save Thy bounty: a

soundness, whereby I may gain strength to serve Thee; and

a devotion whereby I may deserve Thy magnificent reward;

and an immediate prosperity by means of fair earnings;

and guard me on occasions of danger with Thy protection

and place me under Thy defense, against future sorrows and anxieties.

</p><p align="justify">O Lord, bless Muhammad and his Aal, and let my adherence

to him be an effectual intercession on the day of

Judgment, verily Thou art the most Merciful.

</p><p></p><hr noshade="">

<p></p><h2 align="center">FRIDAY DU'A </h2>

<p></p><hr noshade="">

<p align="justify">Praise be to God, who existed before

creation and the giving of life, and who shall continue

to exist after all things have perished.

</p><p align="justify">The Knower, who forgets not him who remembers Him; Who

does not diminish him who gives Him thanks; who does not

disappoint him who prays to Him; and does not frustrate

the hope of him who places hope in Him.

</p><p align="justify">O Lord, I call Thee to witness -- and Thou art sufficient

as a witness; and I call all Thy angels and inhabitants

of Thy heavens and bearers of Thy Arsh (Throne) and Thy

prophets and Thy apostles whom Thou didst entrust with

Thy mission and the various creatures whom Thou hast

created; to witness that I bear testimony that certainly

Thou and Thou alone art God, There being no God but Thee;

Thou art alone there being no associate with Thee nor

peer, and there is no untruth in Thy word, nor change.

</p><p align="justify">And that, verily, Muhammad -- may Thy blessings be on him

and his Aal -- is Thy servant and Thy apostle; he

delivered to Thy servants the message with which Thou

didst entrust him, and exerted himself in the cause of

God the Honorable, the Exalted, as it deserved; and he

gave happy tidings of reward which was certain, and

threatened with punishment which was true.

</p><p align="justify">O Lord, keep me firm in Thy religion as long as Thou

keepest me alive; and let not my heart deviate; after

Thou hast guided me; and let me have mercy from Thee;

verily, Thou and Thou alone art the Giver.

</p><p align="justify">Bless Muhammad and his Aal and make us of the number of

his followers and his adherents, and raise me (on the

last day) amongst his band; and give me the grace to be

regular in my performance of the Friday prayer and to win

such of Thy bounty as Thou wilt allot to the deserving

observers of Fridays, on the day of recompense. Verily,

Thou and Thou alone art the Mighty, the Wise.
