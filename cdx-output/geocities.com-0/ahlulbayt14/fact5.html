<p align="CENTER"><b><font size="8" color="red">Israeli Terrorism</font> </b>
</p><p></p><hr size="1">
<p align="justify">Zionists believe that terror acts are the only and the  ideal means to accomplish their colonialist and expansionist targets to get at the  innocents and opponents in the world.
</p><p align="justify">Terrorism concept has been clearly seen in the Zionist movement blood, mentality, and even in their writings. It was in their general notion on the way to fulfil the movement sinister aims.
</p><p align="justify">All studies of the Zionist movement history have underlined its conjunction with terrorism which is part and parcel of its mentality, existence and its leaders' deeds, acts, and words.
</p><p align="justify">Perdishfiski, a Zionist spiritual leader, reiterated that violent revolution is the straight way for Israel's emergence. Nations live by the sword not the book, he said.
</p><p align="justify">Jabotinski, another Zionist leader, who came after Perdishfiski, translated Zionists believe in violence in an applicable way. A terrorist gang, like Irgon, was his brainchild. He told Jewish youths that: those who die while fighting Arabs will remain immortal in Jews thought.
</p><p align="justify">Menachem Begin, another Israeli premier had published in 1951 a book under the title the Rebellion in which he spoke about his terrorist memories in Palestine when he presided Irgon organization, to fight is to exist said Begin in the book.
</p><p align="justify">He regarded manners of oppression and terrifying implemented by Jews before Israel's being as the only effective style to secure Jewish national targets in Palestine.
</p><p align="justify">As a result of the reign terror in the mentality of wide-scaled Jews classes, the Zionist movement brought into being terrorist organizations. It was when British mandate on Palestine started that the Hganah organization established itself in 1920. The Argon in 1931 and the Stern in 1940. It were then when Stern separated from Irgon to be he headed by Yitzhak Shamir.
</p><p align="justify">Terror organizations have put to use acts of killing and intimidation that in turn put pressure on Arab Palestinians to leave their homeland. They incited Jews in Palestine to fight Palestinians in 1921 and along May of that year where bloody confrontations carried out in Java City and the outcome was 95 innocent Palestinians killed and 219 wounded. 
</p><p align="justify">Zionists went on in attacking Arab citizens, expelling them out of their land, killing those whom they fear and exploding their cars and factories until they reached their first aim, as  to endorse partition, and make Britons leave Palestine. At that step, the tragedy of the Palestinian people started where he removed from his country to be uprooted and collective massacres brought into action against his sons.
</p><p align="justify">In the following pages we present Israeli Documents on the Zionist Terror:
</p><p align="justify">On October 28, 1948, Israeli battalion 89, headed by Moshe Dayan attacked Al-Dawaymeh, a village West to Hebron, to kill children and old aged men and women, Israel newspaper Davaar  said on June 9, 1979.
</p><p align="justify">96 Palestinians killed and many houses detonated according to Davaar in that assault.
</p><p align="justify">On October 29, 1948, Zionist armors patrolled near Al-Darawish Mosque at the same village as 75 old aged worshipers were praying. They shoot and killed all of them.
</p><p align="justify">A Zionist soldier who took part in the attack on A-dawaymeh said: we shoot and killed from 80 to 100 Arab women and children where we used sticks to break their heads too.
</p><p align="justify">Memoir of Israel premier Moshe Shatrit, from 1954 to 1955, published by Marriv In 1979, poses as an official admission that nullifies the fabricated pretext of the so-called Israel's Security.
</p><p align="justify"> Israel's Security is the Red Title that covers a number of Israel's breaches of the international Law and Human Rights in the past and present, Shatrit said.
</p><p align="justify">Israel has made up its entity through oppression, usurpation of land and through thousands of massacres perpetrated. It is the party that kidnapped some foreign personalities and moved them to the occupied land of Palestine. It is Israel that used booby-trapped mail and packages. 
</p><p align="justify">So, this is what Israel is. It is but a racial, terrorist entity built on the destruction of others through different means of killing, torture, and deportation committing endless carnages and massacres.
</p><p align="justify">Israel is more adamant under the extremist Government of Benjamin Netanyahu to pursue its bloody history of crimes against humanity with its anti-peace policy and rejection to abide to world legitimacy resolutions paying no heed to the exerted international efforts as to nudge the faltering Mideast peace process.
</p><p></p><hr size="1">
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is Israel that assassinated Egyptian and German scientists. It is Israel that staged air- raids on refugee camps. It is it that encouraged drug smuggling to Egypt and flooded its markets with counterfeited currencies and rotten food. It is Israel that secretly passed to Egypt mail stamps that were painted with heroine on its sticky side. 
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">A great part of what we mentioned is documented with convictions against Israel that have been expressed in the United Nations Resolutions. The Zionist terror has gone so far and these are some of its bids and terror actions:
</p><p align="justify">* The terror Zionist organization Shtirn tried to assassinate the British military leader Montgomery, according to his dairies.  Somebody has phoned my office to say this is Shtirn gang speaking, we have prepared a bomb to the Field Marshal, Montgomery's dairies, London, 19958, P. 467. 
</p><p align="justify">* Shtirn, itself also made another assassination bid against late US President Truman. It was because fanatic Zionists had felt that he did not give enough support to their claims in Palestine. The White House Intelligent Service was warned by British Secret Service over a trapped message to Truman. The murder attempt was foiled. Novosti, 21, 5, 1988.
</p><p align="justify">* This is a clear proof that there is no way out of the Zionist terror damage. Even countries that have assisted Israel's existence like Britain and the U.S. together with a country like Jordan that Israel signed a peace treatment with. All were not rescued from Israel's big hand.
</p><p align="justify">* Israel Mossad agents conducted a bungled bid against the life of Khaled Mashal, member of the political bureau of Hamas Movement in Amman Sep 25, 1997.
</p><p align="justify">* The terrorist Irgun Organization headed by Menachem Begin staged attacks on the British troop police centers in Palestine upon Britain's Mandate; the result was two Briton soldiers killed. Irgun again said it was responsible for King David Hotel detonation, where 100 persons killed, 41 of them were Arabs and 71 Jews and 28 Britons. The explosion took place in July 22 1946. 
</p><p align="justify">* As a result British authorities haunted Begin to arrest and put him on trial. They allocated $ 50,000 for the person who can put him in jail. Egyptian newspaper al-Ahram March 10, 1992.
</p><p align="justify">* British Newspapers the Time and the Guardian, on March 10, 1992, spoke about the terror record of Menachem Begin. The Guardian said that Britons were still keeping Begin's bloody record, during the British Mandate over Palestine, in their minds.
</p><p align="justify">* The Guardian pointed to a series of sabotage assaults staged by Begin saying  He left behind him a devastating and bloody war, which he directed against Lebanon in 1982.
</p><p align="justify">* Jews killed Lord Mowen in Cairo 1944.
</p><p align="justify">* Jews also exploded a bomb at Goldsmith House Club in Jerusalem where 27 persons killed. It was in 1944.
</p><p align="justify">* Terrorists from Irgun and Hgana gangs carried out Deir Yassin Massacre near Jerusalem where 250 Palestinians were slaughtered.
</p><p align="justify">* A Zionist terror force of 200 armed men attacked Al-sheikh and Hwasa villages in Palestine January 1, 1948, to kill their folks. 
</p><p align="justify">* Zionists carried out Nasser El-Din Massacre in 13,4,48. It is a village near Galilee Sea. They pretended to look like Arabs when they put on Arab customs to enter and butcher its entire people.
</p><p align="justify">* Zionists armors attacked Biet Daris village, East Gaza, in May 21, 1948, to wipe them out.
</p><p align="justify">* Elion Massacre, in October 30, 1948, Zionists slaughtered 12 Palestinian youth.
</p><p align="justify">* Safsaf Massacre in Galilee, 20 Palestinians were tied with robes to be plunged in a well.
</p><p align="justify">* Allud Massacre, in July 11, 1948 where 250 Palestinians were slaughtered in the Church and the Mosque of the town. After a short period, 350 Palestinians were killed in a Zionist bid to expel the town's people and oblige them to run on foot.
</p><p align="justify">* In 1948, Hgana gangs slaughtered 70 Arab youth from Safid Town in the West Bank.
</p><p align="justify">* Irgun gangs detonated two cars at Haifa Market in July 1948, 21 Arabs were put to death and /52/ others wounded.
</p><p align="justify">* In July 11, 1938, a Zionist hurled a bomb on a Mosque in Jerusalem. Ten people were put to death and 30 other prayers wounded. 
</p><p align="justify">* Zionists exploded a booby-trapped car in a market in Jerusalem, in August 26, 1938. 34 Arabs killed and 35 others wounded.
</p><p align="justify">* Irgun gang blew out two bombs in Haifa. 25 Arabs passed away and 39others injured.
</p><p align="justify">* Qibyah Massacre in November 1953, where the occupation Army of Israel butchered 67 Palestinians, demolished 56 houses, together with the village Mosque and two schools.
</p><p align="justify">* Kufr Qassem Massacre, in 29 November 1956, 49 Palestinian children and old-aged persons were killed.
</p><p align="justify">* Zionists assassinated the international mediator runt Bernadette and his French assistant Syrut in September 17, 1948.
</p><p align="justify">* Several villages were demolished by Israeli troops of occupation in the occupied Golan Heights estimated to 122, in addition to its brutal destruction of the Syrian City of Quneitra before Israel pulled its troops out from there in June 1974.
</p><p align="justify">* Israel, in this Zionist meaning finds no self-expression, but through terrorism, which inflicts great damage on humanity.
</p><p align="justify">* Aldous Haxley, the famous British thinker, explored in his book The New World, that Zionism hands are behind rotten germs  injected in the human civilization body all over the world.
</p><p></p><hr size="1">
<p align="justify">Israel, the symbol of world terrorism and occupation, has employed different strategies of killing innocent Arab civilians for many decades, including its persistent assassinations, destruction and demolishment of properties and infrastructure, aggressions and indefinite detentions.
</p><p align="justify">Through its long bloody terrorist history, Israel has implemented assassination bids and elimination operations against scores of Arab and Palestinian intellectuals, freedom fighters, and scientists.
</p><p align="justify">To mention but some of those martyrs perished at the ugly hands of the Israelis; here is a brief list: 
</p><p align="justify">On October16th, 1972, Israeli Mossad agents assassinated Palestinian Liberation Organization Representative to Rome, Wail Zia`ter.
</p><p align="justify">On December 18, 1972, the Israelis assassinated PLO`s Representative to Paris, Mahmoud Al-Hamshri.
</p><p align="justify">In July, 1972, the Israelis assassinated the well known Palestinian Writer, Ghassan Kanafani, whose car was bobby trapped by the Israelis. Kanafanis niece, 9 years old, succumbed to her wounds too.
</p><p align="justify">On April 10, 1973, the Israelis assassinated 3 Palestinians VIPs including a poet, journalist, namely, Kammal Nasser, Mohammad Youssef Al-Najar, and Kamal Adwan in Beirut, Lebanon.
</p><p align="justify">On August 1, 1978, a Palestinian storywriter, Izz Al-Din Al-Qalaq, was assassinated along with his assistant.
</p><p align="justify">On June 1, 1981, the Palestinian Representative to Brussels, Naim Khadr, was assassinated.
</p><p align="justify">On July 1982, PLO assistant representative to Paris was targeted and killed by the Israelis. 
</p><p align="justify">Furthermore, the Israeli notorious intelligence services assassinated the former Palestinian writer, Majid Abu Shrar in Rome, Salah Khalaf, Abu Al-Houl, Khalid Al-Wazir, PLO leaders, were assassinated in Tunisia at the hands of the Israelis too.
</p><p align="CENTER">Destruction and Demolishment
</p><p align="justify">Israel, since the very beginning of its settlement constructions and usurpation of Palestine, has implemented the policy of destruction and demolishment of Arab villages and towns as to build its settlements instead.
</p><p align="justify">The Israelis bulldozed scores of Arab villages in West Ram Allah, Amwas, Yallou, and Beit Nouba in 1967, killed civilians and deported many of them under the threat of being killed.
</p><p align="justify">The occupied Syrian Golan Heights steadfast villages were also targeted by the Israeli barbaric means of destruction and demolishment. Among the villages destroyed by the Israelis are:Khasfin, Al-Aal, Al-Bittiha, Al-Hamidiah, Al-Joukhadar, Al-Hima, Oum Jouzza, Khirbat Fouad, Tali Sultan, Ein Al-Hamra, Samoua, Talit Rihana and Al-Quneitra City, which was completely devastated by the Israelis prior to their retreat in the glorious liberation war of October, the city is still a living example of the Israeli ugly face of terrorism and crime.
</p><p align="justify">Israel also demolished several Arab villages in the West Bank in 1954 like Nahalin, Aqrat, and not to forget Kafr Qassem where the Israelis slaughtered hundreds of Palestinian civilians, Kafr Bara`m, and  many others!!!!
</p><p align="CENTER"><strong>Aggression against Arab Countries</strong>
</p><p align="justify">Since the usurpation of Palestine by Israel and the establishment of the so-called Israeli Entity in 1948, Israel has launched consecutive aggressions against Arab Countries of which are the following against peace-loving Arab neighbors; some of these aggressions targeted in 1956, Egypt, in 1967 it occupied Gaza and Sinai, West Bank, and the Syrian Golan Heights. The repeated Israeli aggressions continued when Israel invaded South Lebanon in 1978. In 1982, the Israeli occupation Army stormed Lebanon again and reached the capital, Beirut, and retreated under heavy pressure from the resistance as to expand the size of the occupied Southern Strip of South Lebanon.
</p><p align="justify">The Israeli frequent aggressions against Arabs were accompanied with several air raids against several Arab villages.
</p><p align="justify">On November 13, 1966, they massacred the citizens of  Al-Saoua, a Jordanian village.
</p><p align="justify">On March 21, 1968, the Israelis carried out a savage air raid, artillery and tanks were also used, against the Jordanian Al-Karamah village, killing thousands of Arabs.
</p><p align="justify">On June4th, 1968, Israeli warplanes raided the Jordanian Irbid town killing 30 Jordanian civilians wounding /59/ others.
</p><p align="justify">In 1970, the Israeli warplanes raided the Egyptian Abu Zou`bil Factory where 70 workers were killed and /98/ wounded after the then Israeli perpetrated Massacre against an Egyptian School, Bahr Al-Baqar, where hundreds of school children were cold- bloodedly eliminated by the Israelis.
</p><p align="justify">In 1973, the Israeli warplanes downed a Libyan civilian aircraft killing its passengers and crew.
</p><p align="justify">In 1980, Israeli warplanes launched air raids against an Iraqi nuclear reactor, used for peaceful purposes. The raid came at a time when the Israeli occupation entity possesses stockpiles of more than 200 Nuclear heads AT Daimouna Reactor in Al-Naqab. Tunisia also as well as many other Arab Countries were also targeted by the Israeli raids and warplanes.
</p><p align="justify">Thus, terrorism and aggression have ever been the Israeli tailored trademark as a means of elimination, not only against Palestine but the entire Arab Countries; and to mention the Israeli heinous crime at Lebanese innocent shelterless children and elderly people at a UN Compound in Qana, in April 1996 where more than a hundred of them were smashed and burned into ashes.
</p><p align="justify"> 
</p><p align="justify">The Israeli terrorism is but an open-ended series. The recent of which is the Israeli live bullets fired at Palestinian demonstrators, hungry for their long-awaited for freedom, inside the occupied Arab territories on the 50 anniversary of the usurpation of Palestine by the Israelis, where tens of Palestinians were killed or wounded.
</p><p align="center"><strong>Detention</strong>
</p><p align="justify">Detention is yet another means of oppression and aggression implemented by the Israelis against Arabs. Tens of thousands of Arabs from different countries are being held indiscriminately behind bars in the Israeli notorious detention camps and prisons, most of them with no parole.
</p><p align="justify">Israeli prisons are crowded with more than 5000 thousand Palestinian freedom fighters, though of the so-called Oslo Agreements and the creation of Palestine Self-rule Authority. Thousands and of other Arab nationalities are chained and crammed inside the Israeli Cells And Nazi-model concentration camps like Anssar Detention Camp.
</p><p align="justify">These Arab prisoners live under unbearable inhuman conditions where they are deprived from each and every necessary prerequisites of life. They are being tortured via all means of torture and humiliation where even the little of food they offered is filled with insects by the Israeli jailers.
</p><p align="justify">Many of the prisoners are affected, due to long terms of detention and torture, with acute diseases like Asthma, Tuber Culosis, Phthisis, Stomach pain and several other kinds of diseases. Furthermore, the prisoners family members visits are inadmissible, and if not it is under the threat of prisoners frequent removals to other unknown prisons. 
</p><p align="justify">This is but a glimpse of the Israeli Zionist Criminal history against Arabs. It is part of the bloody lexicon of the Israeli Dictionary of terrorism, written by the racist Israelis with the blood of innocent Arab civilians.
