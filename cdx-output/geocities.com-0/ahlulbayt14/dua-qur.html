</p><p align="justify">4. Our Lord! Lay not upon us such a burden as You did lay upon those before us. 
(2:286)




</p><p align="justify">5. Our Lord! Impose not on us that which we have not the strength to bear,
grant us forgiveness and have mercy on us. You are our Protector.
Help us against those who deny the truth. (2:286)




</p><p align="justify">6. Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate from the truth after 
You have guided us, and bestow upon us mercy from Your grace. 
Verily You are the Giver of bounties without measure. (3:8)

and save us from shame on the Day of Judgement. Verily You never fail
to fulfill Your promise. (3:194)




</p><p align="justify">12. Our Lord! We have sinned against ourselves, and unless You grant us forgiveness

Your mercy from people who deny the truth (10:85-86)





</p><p align="justify">17. Our Lord! You truly know all that we may hide [in our hearts] 
as well as all that we bring into the open, for nothing whatever, 
be it on earth or in heaven, remains hidden from Allah (14:38)





</p><p align="justify">18. Our Lord! Bestow on us mercy from Your presence 
and dispose of our affairs for us in the right way. (18:10)

and to the righteous from among their fathers, 
their wives and their offspring, 
for verily You are alone the Almighty and the truly Wise. (40:8)




</p><p align="justify">22. Our Lord! Relieve us of the torment, for we do really believe. (44:12)




</p><p align="justify">23. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins as well as those of our brethren who
proceeded us in faith and let not our hearts entertain any unworthy 
thoughts or feelings against [any of] those who have believed. Our Lord! 
You are indeed full of kindness and Most Merciful (59:10)




</p><p align="justify">24. Our Lord! In You we have placed our trust, and to You do we turn in repentance, 
for unto You is the end of all journeys. (60:4)




</p><p align="justify">25. Our Lord! Perfect our light for us and forgive us our sins, for verily 
You have power over all things. (66:8)
