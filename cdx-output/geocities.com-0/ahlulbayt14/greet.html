<center><p><b><font color="#005500" size="5">How to Send Greetings to Prophet Muhammad?</font></b>
</p><p><table border="10" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="10" width="90%"> 
<tbody><tr><td>
<p>When sending greetings to Prophet Muhammad,

</p><li>some say: Peace be upon him (PBUH)

</li><li>others say: Peace be upon him and his family (PBUH&amp;HF;)

</li><li>some others say are more generous and say: Peace be upon him

and his family (Aalihi) and his wives (wa Azwajihi) and all his

companions (wa Sahbihi Ajma'een).

<p align="justify">Now let us see how the Prophet himself thought us to send blessing for him:
</p><p align="justify">The Messenger of Allah (PBUH&amp;HF;) said, "Do not salute

for me in short!" The companions asked, "What is saluting

in short?" The Prophet replied, "Saying that Blessing

of Allah be upon Muhammad." They asked, "what should

we say?" the Prophet (PBUH&amp;HF;) answered, "Say: Blessing

of Allah be upon Muhammad and his Ahlul-Bayt." In another

wordings the Prophet replied: "Say: O Allah bless Muhammad

and his household the same way as you blessed Abraham and his

household. Verily you are worthy of all praise full of all glory!".

</p><p>Reference:

</p></li><li>al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah, by Ibn Hajar, Ch. 11, section 1, p225

<p align="justify">This saying of the Prophet was in connection with the following

verse of Quran which was related about the House of Abraham (AS):
</p><p align="justify">They said: "Do you wonder at Allah's decree? The Mercy of

Allah and His Blessings be upon you O people of the house! for

He is indeed worthy of all praise full of all glory!" (Quran 11:73)

</p><p align="justify">Moreover, Ibn Hajar also mentioned that some of the Sunni commentators

of Quran have narrated from Ibn Abbas (RA) that the Quranic verse

"Peace be upon the family of Yaaseen (Quran 37:130)"

refers to the family of Muhammad. (See al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah,

by Ibn Hajar, Ch. 11, section 1, p228).

</p><p align="justify">From the tradition given earlier, one can see that the Messenger

of Allah (PBUH&amp;HF;) mentioned his name and his Ahlul-Bayt together,

and disliked mentioning his name alone. He specifically ordered

that his followers SHOULD include his family in all their greetings

to the Prophet Muhammad. This because ONLY those individuals whom

Quran testifies to their perfect purity (the last sentence of

Verse 33:33) are worthy of being saluted. Let us look at more

traditions, this time from Sahih al-Bukhari:


</p><p>Sahih al-Bukhari Hadith: 6.320<br>

Narrated Ka'b bin Ujra:<br>
</p><p align="justify">It was said, "O Allah's Apostle! We know how to greet you,

but how to invoke Allah for you?" The Prophet said, "Say:

O Allah! Send your blessings/greetings (Salawat) on Muhammad and

his family, the same way as You sent Your blessings/greetings

on Abraham's family. You are indeed worthy of all praise, full

of glory.'"
</p><p>Sahih al-Bukhari Hadith: 6.321<br>

Narrated Abu Said al-Khudri:<br>
</p><p align="justify">We said, "O Allah's Apostle! (We know) this greeting (to

you) but how shall we invoke Allah for you?" He said, "Say:

O Allah! Send your greetings on Muhammad who is Your servant and

Your Messenger, the same way as You sent Your greetings on Abraham's

family. And send Your blessings on Muhammad and on Muhammad's

family, the same way as You sent Your blessings on Abraham's family."

</p><p>Sahih al-Bukhari Hadith: 6.322<br>

Narrated Ibn Abi Hazim and Ad-Darawardi:<br>
</p><p align="justify">Yazid reported (similarly with the following wordings) "...And

send Your blessings on Muhammad and on Muhammad's family, the

same way as You sent Your blessings on Abraham and on Abraham's

family."

</p><p>Sahih al-Bukhari Hadith: 8.368<br>

Narrated 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Laila:<br>
</p><p align="justify">Ka'b bin 'Ujra met me and said, "Shall I give you a present?

Once the Prophet (saw) came to us and we said, 'O Allah's Apostle!

We know how to greet You; but how to send Salat upon you?' He

said 'Say: O Allah! Send your greetings (Salawat) on Muhammad

and his family, the same way as You sent Your Salawat on Abraham's

family. O Allah! Send Your blessings on Muhammad and on Muhammad's

family, the same way as You sent Your blessings on Abraham's family.

You are indeed worthy of all praise, full of glory.'"

</p><p align="justify">Two more traditions are as follows:

Abu Masud Badri relates: (Once) we, were sitting with Sad bin

Ubadah when the Holy Prophet came to us. Bashir Ibn Sad asked

the Holy Prophet: O Messenger of Allah, we have been commanded

by Allah to invoke blessings on you by reciting Salat, then how

shall we do this ? The Holy Prophet kept quite for sometime,
so much so that we wished that Bashar bin Sad had not asked the

question from the Holy Prophet. After some time the Holy Prophet

said these words :

</p><p align="justify">O Allah, send Thy blessings on Muhammad and on the children of
Muhammad as Thou didst send Thy blessings on Abraham, and bless

Muhammad and the children of Muhammad as Thou didst bless Abraham.

Indeed Thou art the praiseworthy, the Glorious. Continuing, the

Holy Prophet said : and the salutation is already known to you.

</p><p>Reference: Riyadh al-Saliheen, by al-Nawawi, English version,

Tradition #1406

</p><p align="justify">Although the above traditions confirm that the Prophet (PBUH&amp;HF;)

ordered people to send Salawat on him and his family. This can

not be regarded as self-esteem, rather it was the order by Allah

to do that. It served as teaching the Sunnah to people. Specially

the highlighted part in the last tradition shows that the Prophet

was hesitating to salute himself at first, but since it was the

order of Allah, he conveyed the message. In another tradition:

</p><p align="justify">When the Messenger of Allah noticed that a blessing from Allah

was to descent, he told Safiyya (one of his wives): "Call

for me! Call for me!" Safiyya said: "Call who, O the

Messenger of Allah?" He said: "Call for me my Ahlul-Bayt

who are Ali, Fatimah, al-Hasan, and al-Husain." Thus we sent

for them and they came to him. Then the Prophet (PBUH&amp;HF;)

spread his cloak (upper garment) over them, and raised his hand

(toward sky) saying: "O Allah! These are my family (Aalee),

so bless Muhammad and the family (Aal) of Muhammad." And

Allah, to whom belong Might and Majesty, revealed: "Verily

Allah intends to keep off from you every kind of uncleanness O'

People of the House (Ahlul-Bayt), and purify you a thorough purification

(Quran, the last sentence of Verse 33:33)".

</p><p>References:

</p></li><li>al-Mustadrak by al-Hakim, Chapter of "Understanding (the

virtues) of Companions, v3, p148. The author then wrote: "This

tradition is authentic (Sahih) based on the criteria of the two

Shaikhs (al-Bukhari and Muslim)."

</li><li>Talkhis of al-Mustadrak, by al-Dhahabi, v3, p148

</li><li>Usdul Ghabah, v3, p33

<p align="justify">Similarly, it is narrated that in another occasion, when the Messenger

of Allah gathered Ali, Fatimah, al-Hasan, al-Husain (peace be

upon them all) under his cloak, he said:

</p><p align="justify">"O Allah! Verily they are from me and I am from them. Thus

place Your blessings and Your mercy and Your satisfaction on me

and them."<br>
and:
</p><p align="justify">"O Allah! These are Aale-Muhammad (family of Muhammad). Thus

place Your blessings and Your bounty upon the family of Muhammad,

for, indeed You are the praiseworthy, the Glorious."

</p><p>Reference:<br>
</p></li><li>al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah, by Ibn Hajar, Ch. 11, section 1, p225,

quoted from Ahmad Ibn Hanbal

<p>Also it is narrated that:

</p><p align="justify">The Messenger of Allah (PBUH&amp;HF;) said: "If one prays,

and in it he does not send blessings to me and my family, his

prayer will not be accepted."

</p><p>References:

</p></li><li>al-Darqunti, and al-Bayhaqi, as quoted in:

</li><li>al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah, by Ibn Hajar al-Haythami, Ch. 11, p349

<p align="justify">In fact, invoking Salawat on the Prophet's family was so important

that it has been included in ANY Salawat on the Prophet (PBUH&amp;HF;).

Invoking Salawat on the family of the Prophet is a sign of pledging

allegiance to them, and affirming what Allah Himself has affirmed

for them: They are perfectly cleansed and worthy of being saluted.
