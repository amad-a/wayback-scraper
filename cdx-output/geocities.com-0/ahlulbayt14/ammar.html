</p><p align="justify">Narrated 'Ikrima: That Ibn 'Abbas told him and 'Ali bin 'Abdullah to go to Abu Said and listen to some of his narrations; So they both went (and saw) Abu Said and his brother irrigating a garden belonging to them. When he saw them, he came up to them and sat down with his legs drawn up and wrapped in his garment and said, "(During the construction of the mosque of the Prophet) we carried the adobe of the mosque, one brick at a time while 'Ammar used to carry two at a time. The Prophet passed by 'Ammar and removed the dust off his head and said, "May Allah be merciful to 'Ammar. He will be killed by a rebellious aggressive group. 'Ammar will invite them to (obey) Allah and they will invite him to the (Hell) fire." 
</p><p>Sahih Muslim - <a href="http://www.iiu.edu.my/deed/hadith/muslim/041_smt.html">Book 41, Number 6968 - 6970</a>
</p></b><p align="justify"><b>Umm Salama reported that Allah's Messenger (s) said to 'Ammar: A group of rebels  would kill you. 
</b>
</p><p></p><hr noshade="" width="80%">
<p align="justify">Ammar ibn Yasir ibn Amir al-Ansi al-Makhzumi (from Banu Makhzum) was one of the earliest converts to Islam, and the first Muslim to build a mosque in his own house in which he used to worship Allah (at-Tabaqat, vol. 3, Part 1, p. 178; Usd al-ghabah, vol. 4, p. 46; Ibn Kathir, at-Tarikh, vol. 7, p. 311).
</p><p align="justify">Ammar accepted Islam along with his father Yasir and his  mother Sumayyah. They suffered great tortures by the Quraysh, due to their conversion to Islam, to such an extent that Ammar lost his parents; and they were the first martyrs man and woman in Islam. 
</p><p align="justify">Ammar was among those who immigrated to Abyssinia, and the earliest immigrants (muhajirun) to Medina. He was present in the battle of Badr and all other battles as well as places of assembly by the Muslims during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet (s); and he showed his might and favour in all Islamic struggles in the best way. 
</p><p align="justify">Many traditions are narrated from the Holy Prophet (s) about Ammar regarding his virtues, outstanding traits and his glorious deeds.
</p><p align="justify">The Holy Prophet had told Ammar Ibn Yasir along with his parents that: "Family of Yasir, be patient, for your destination is paradise," (Sahih al-Tirmidhi, v5, p233)
</p><p align="justify">The Holy Prophet (s) said: That Ammar was filled with faith from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet. (Ibn Majah, as-Sunan, vol. 1, p. 65; Abu NuAym, Hilyah al-Awliya, vol. 1, p. 139; al-Haytami, Majma az-zawaid, vol. 9, p. 295; al-Isti`ab, vol. 3, p. 1137; al-Isabah, vol. 2, p. 512)
</p><p align="justify">The Holy Prophet (s) said: "Ammar is with the truth and the truth is with Ammar. He turns wherever the truth turns". "Ammar is as near to me as an eye is near to the nose. Alas! a rebellious group will kill him". (at-Tabaqat, vol. 3, part 1, p. 187; al-Mustadrak, vol. 3, p. 392; Ibn Hisham, as-Sirah, vol. 2, p. 143; Ibn Kathir, at-Tarikh, vol. 7, pp. 268-270)
</p><p align="justify">The Holy Prophet (s) also told him that "Ammar be cheerful, the aggressor party shall kill you." (al-Mustadrak, by al-Hakim, v3, p383, and Sahih Muslim, English version, v4, chapter MCCV, Traditions #6968&amp; #6970)
</p><p align="justify">The English translator of Sahih Muslim (Abdul Hamid Siddiqui) has written in the footnote of the above traditions that: This narration is clearly indicative of the fact that in the conflict between Hadrat Ali and his opponents, Hadrat Ali was on the right as Ammar Ibn Yasir was killed in the Battle of Siffin fighting in the camp of Hadrat Ali. (Footnote of Sahih Muslim, English version, v4, p1508).
</p><p align="justify">The Holy Prophet (s) said: Alas! a rebellious group which swerves from the truth will murder Ammar. Ammar will be calling them towards Paradise and they will be calling him towards Hell. His killer and those who strip him of arms and clothing will be in Hell. (al-Bukhari, Sahih, vol. 8, pp. 185-186; at-Tirmidhi, al-Jami` as-Sahih, vol. 5, p. 669; Ahmad ibn Hanbal, al-Musnad, vol. 2, pp. 161,164,206; vol. 3, pp.5, 22, 28, 91; vol. 4, pp.197, 199, vol. 5 pp.215, 306, 307; vol. 6, pp.289, 300, 311, 315, and all the narrators of Islamic traditions and historians transmitted through twenty-five Companions)
</p><p align="justify">Ibn Hajar al-`Asqalani (in Tahdhib al-Tahdhib, vol. 7, p. 409; al-Isabah, vol. 2, p.512) and as-Suyuti (in al-Khasais al-kubra, vol. 2, p. 140) say: "The narration of this (above mentioned) tradition is mutawatir (i.e. narrated successively by so many people that no doubt can be entertained about its authenticity)." 
</p><p align="justify">Ibn Abd al-Barr (in al-Isti`ab, vol. 3, p. 1140) said: The narration followed uninterrupted succession from the Holy Prophet (s), that he said: "A rebellious group will murder Ammar," and this is a prophecy of the Prophet's secret knowledge and the sign of his prophethood. This tradition is among the most authentic and the most rightly ascribed traditions.
</p><p align="justify">After the death of the Holy Prophet (s), Ammar was one of the closest  adherents and best supporters of Amir al-mu'minin Imam Ali during the reign of the first three Caliphs.
</p><p align="justify">During the caliphate of `Uthman when the Muslim protested (to `Uthman) against his policy on the distribution of the Public Treasury (Baytu al-mal) `Uthman said in a public assembly that, the money which as in the treasury was sacred and belonged to Allah, and that he (as being the successor of the Prophet) had the right to dispose of them as he thought fit. He (`Uthman) threatened and cursed all who presumed to censure or murmur at what he said. Upon this, `Ammar ibn Yasir boldly declared his disapprobation and began to charge him with his inveterate propensity to ignore the interests of the general public; accused him with reviving the heathenish customs abolished by the Prophet. Whereupon `Uthman commanded him to be beaten and immediately some of the Umayyads, the kindred of the
Caliph fell upon the venerable `Ammar, and the Caliph himself kicking him with his shoes (on his feet) on `Ammar's testicles, and afflicted him with hernia. `Ammar became unconscious for three days, and he was taken care of by Umm al-mu'minin Umm Salamah in her own house. (al-Baladhuri, Ansab al-ashraf, vol. 5, pp. 48,54,88; Ibn Abi  al-Hadid, vol. 3, pp. 47-52; al-lmamah wa al-siyasah, vol. 1, pp. 35-36; al-`Iqd al-farid, vol. 4, p. 307; at-Tabaqat, vol. 3, Part 1, p. 185; Tarikh al-khamis, vol. 2, p. 271).
</p><p align="justify">When Amir al-mu'minin Imam Ali became Caliph, Ammar was one of his most sincere supporters. He participated fully in all social, political and military activities during this period, especially in the Camel battle  and the battle of Siffin. 
</p><p align="justify">However, Ammar was martyred on 9th Safar 37 A.H. in the battle of Siffin when a he was over ninety years of age. On the day Ammar ibn Yasir achieved martyrdom, he turned his face to the sky and said:
</p><p align="justify">O' Allah! surely Thou art aware that if I know that Thy wish is that I should plunge myself into this River (the Euphrates) and be drowned, I will do it. 
</p><p align="justify">O' Allah! surely Thou knowest that if I knew that Thou would be pleased if I put my scimitar on my chest (to hit my heart) and pressed it so hard that it came out of my back, I would do it. 
</p><p align="justify">O' Allah! I do not think there is anything more pleasant to Thee than fighting with this sinful group, and if knew that any action were more pleasant to Thee I would do it. 
</p><p align="justify">Abu Abd ar-Rahman as-Sulami narrates:  "We were present with Amir al-mu'minin at Siffin where I saw Ammar ibn Yasir was not turning his face towards any side, nor valleys of Siffin but the companions of the Holy Prophet (s) were following him as if he was a sign for them. Then I heard Ammar say to Hashim ibn 'Utbah (al-Mirqal):
O' Hashim! rush into enemy's ranks, paradise is under sword!.  Today I meet beloved one, Muhammad and his party. 
</p><p align="justify">Then he said: By Allah, if they put us to flight (and pursue us) to the date-palms of Hajar (a town in Bahrain) we know surely that we are right and they are wrong.
</p><p align="justify">Then Ammar continued (addressing the enemies):  We struck you to (believe in) its (Holy QurAn) revelation; And today we strike you to (believe in) its interpretation; Such strike as to remove heads from their resting places; And to make the friend forget his sincere friend; Until the truth returns to its (right) path. 
</p><p align="justify">The narrator says: I did not see the Holy Prophet's companions killed at any time as many as they were killed on this day.
</p><p align="justify">Then Ammar spurred his horse, entered the battlefield and began fighting. He persistently chased the enemy, made attack after attack, and raised challenging slogans till at last a group of mean-spirited Syrians surrounded him on all sides, and a man named Abu al-Ghadiyah al-Juhari (al-Fazari) inflicted such a wound upon him that he could not bear it, and returned to his camp. He asked for water. A tumbler of milk was brought to him. When Ammar looked at the tumbler he said: "The Messenger of Allah had said the right thing." People asked him what he meant by these words. He said "The Messenger of Allah informed me that the last sustenance for me in this world would be milk." Then he took that tumbler of milk in his hands, drank the milk and surrendered his life to Allah, the Almighty. When Amir al-mu'minin came to know of his death, he came to Ammar's side, put his (Ammar's) head on his own lap, and recited the following elegy to mourn his death: 
</p><p align="justify">Surely any Muslim who is not distressed at the murder of the son of Yasir, and is not be afflicted by this grievous misfortune does not have true faith. 
</p><p align="justify">May Allah show His mercy to Ammar the day he embraced Islam, may Allah show His mercy to Ammar the day he was killed, and may Allah show His mercy to Ammar the day he is raised to life. 
</p><p align="justify">Certainly, I found Ammar (on such level) that three companions of the Holy Prophet (s) could not be named unless he was the fourth, and four of them could not be mentioned unless he was the fifth. 
</p><p align="justify">There was none among the Holy Prophet's companions who doubted that not only was Paradise once or twice compulsorily bestowed upon Ammar, but that he gained his claim to it (a number of times). May Paradise give enjoyment to Ammar. 
</p><p align="justify">Certainly, the Holy Prophet (s) said: "Surely, Ammar is with the truth and the truth is with Ammar. He turns wherever the truth turns. His killer will be in hell." 
</p><p align="justify">Then Amir al-mu'minin Imam Ali stepped forward and offered funeral prayers for him, and then with his own hands, he buried him with his clothes. 
</p><p align="justify">Ammar's death caused a good deal of commotion in the ranks of Mu`awiyah too, because there were a large number of prominent people fighting from his side under the impression created in their minds that he was fighting Amir al-mu'minin for a right cause. These people were aware of the saying of the Holy Prophet (s) that Ammar would be killed by a group who would be on the wrong side. When they observed that Ammar had been killed by Muawiyah's army, they became convinced that they were on the wrong side and that Amir al-mu'minin was definitely on the right. This agitation thus caused among the leaders as well as the rank and file of Muawiyah's army, was quelled by him with the argument that it was Amir al-mu'minin who brought Ammar to the battlefield and therefore it was he who was responsible for his death. When Muawiyah's argument was mentioned before Amir al-mu'minin he said it was as though the Prophet (s) was responsible for killing Hamzah as he brought him to the battle of Uhud.
