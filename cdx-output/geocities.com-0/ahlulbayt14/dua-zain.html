<p>Blessing upon the Attesters to the Messengers
</p><p>Du'a by Imam Zainul-'Abedeen (a)
</p><p>His Supplication in Calling down Blessings upon the Followers of, and Attesters to, the Messengers
</p><p></p><hr size="1">
<p>O Allah,<br>
as for the followers
of the messengers<br>
and those of
the people of the earth<br>
who attested to them unseen<br>
(while the obstinate resisted them through crying lies)<br>
they yearned for the emissaries through the realities of faith,<br>
</p><p>in every era and time in which Thou didst send a messenger<br>
and set up for the people a director<br>
from the period of Adam down to Muhammad (s)<br>
from among the imams of guidance<br>
and the leaders of the godfearing<br>
remember them
with forgiveness and good pleasure!
</p><p>O Allah,<br>
and as for the
Companions of Muhammad specifically,<br>
those who did
well in companionship,<br>
who stood the
good test in helping him,<br>
responded to him<br>
when he made them hear his messages' argument,
</p><p>separated from mates and children<br>
in manifesting his word,<br>
fought against fathers and sons<br>
in strengthening his prophecy,<br>
and through him gained victory;
</p><p>those who were
wrapped in affection for him,<br>
hoping for a commerce<br>
that comes not to naught in love for him;
</p><p>those who were
left by their clans<br>
when they clung to his handhold<br>
and denied by their kinsfolk<br>
when they rested in the shadow of his kinship;
</p><p>O Allah,<br>
forget not what they abandoned for Thee and in Thee,<br>
and make them
pleased with Thy good pleasure<br>
for the sake of the creatures they drove to Thee<br>
while they were with Thy Messenger,<br>
summoners to Thee for Thee.
</p><p>Show gratitude to them for leaving the abodes of their people for Thy sake<br>

and going out from a plentiful livelihood to a narrow one,<br>
and [show gratitude to] those of them who became objects of wrongdoing<br>

and whom Thou multiplied in exalting Thy religion.
</p><p>O Allah,<br>
and give to those<br>
who have done well in following the Companions,<br>
who say, Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers<br>
who went before us in faith<br>
Thy best reward;
</p><p>those who went
straight to the Companions' road,<br>
sought out their course,<br>
and proceeded in their manner.
</p><p>No doubt concerning
their sure insight diverted them<br>
and no uncertainty shook them<br>
from following in their tracks<br>
and being led by the guidance of their light.
</p><p>As their assistants
and supporters,<br>
they professed their religion,<br>
gained guidance through their guidance,<br>
came to agreement with them,<br>
and never accused them in what they passed on to them.
</p><p>O Allah,<br>
and bless the Followers,<br>
from this day of ours to the Day of Doom,<br>
their wives,<br>
their offspring,<br>
and those among them who obey Thee,
</p><p>with a blessing through which<br>
Thou wilt preserve them from disobeying Thee,<br>
make room for them in the plots of Thy Garden,<br>
defend them from the trickery of Satan,<br>
help them in the piety in which they seek help from Thee,<br>
protect them from sudden events that come by night and day<br>
- except the events which come with good -
</p><p>and incite them to<br>
tie firmly the knot of good hope in Thee,<br>
what is with Thee,<br>
and refrain from ill thoughts [toward Thee]<br>
because of what the hands of Thy servants' hold.
</p><p>Thus Thou mayest<br>
restore them to beseeching Thee and fearing Thee,<br>
induce them to renounce the plenty of the immediate,<br>
make them love to<br>
work for the sake of the deferred<br>
and prepare for what comes after death,
</p><p>make easy for
them every distress that comes to them<br>
on the day when souls take leave from bodies,
</p><p>release them from<br>
that which brings about the perils of temptation<br>
and being thrown down in the Fire<br>
and staying forever within it,
</p><p>and take them to security,<br>
the resting place of the godfearing.
