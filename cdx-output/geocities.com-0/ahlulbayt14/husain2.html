<p align="center"><font color="red" size="5"><b>HUSAIN - THE REVOLUTIONARY</b></font>
</p><p></p><hr noshade="" width="80%">
<p><font color="red">Karbala</font> ... <font color="red">Karbala</font> ... the garden of swords, blood and inspiration for innumerable pens

</p><p><font color="red">Karbala</font> is the word of right ... the hymn on the lips of time.

</p><p><font color="red">Karbala</font> is a poem ... a rhyme of anguish and pain.

</p><p align="justify"><font color="red">Karbala</font> never passes away. Its sun never sets in the horizon

of history. Its anguish can never be effaced from the conscience

of freemen by the collective conspiracy of tyrants.

</p><p align="justify">At <font color="red">Karbala</font> clouds of blood rained and generations of martyrs

and revolutionaries took root and sprouted. The sound of the

fearless voice of Imam <font color="red">Husain</font> still echoes in the valley of

Al-Tufoof, ringing in the ears of time. It is a hurricane that

chafes and shakes the tyrants. It is a volcano of blood,

violently jolting the despots' thrones. It awakens free

consciences and stirs within man the spirit of revolution and

Jihad. His voice is still echoing in the ears of mankind:

</p><p align="justify"><b>By Allah, I will never give you my hand like a man who

has been humiliated, nor will I flee like a slave."</b>

</p><p align="justify">Who actually is <font color="red">Husain</font> ?<br>
What is the background of this exceptionally unique and great personality ?<br>
This prominent man of history, the legend of epics, the word of pride and honour was no

less the grandson of Prophet Muhammad (s), the son of his

daughter Fatimah al-Zahra and her cousin and husband the

Commander of the Faithful, Imam Ali Ibn Abi Talib.
</p><p align="justify">The martyr <font color="red">Husain</font> was born in al-Madinah on the fifth of

Sha'ban 4 A.H. His birth was applauded by the prophetic family.

The Prophet (s) himself named him <font color="red">Husain</font>.

</p><p align="justify">He was raised under the care of the Apostle of Allah (s),

his daughter Fatimah (a) and the Commander of the Faithful Ali

(a). <font color="red">Husain</font> imbibed prophetic morals and drank deeply of the

Islamic principles of justice and righteousness. He was dearly

loved by the Apostle of Allah (s), who used to carry him and

his elder brother, Imam Hassan (a) in his arms and declare

expensively in front of his companions.

</p><p align="justify"><b>"O Allah, I love them and love

those who love them."</b>

</p><p align="justify">He expressed his deeply felt love for Hassan and <font color="red">Husain</font> (a) in these words:

</p><p align="justify"><b>"These two sons of mine are my two

plants of sweet basil in this world."</b>

</p><p align="justify"><b>"Whoever loves Hassan and <font color="red">Husain</font>

then he loves me and whoever dislikes them then he dislikes me." </b>

</p><p align="justify">The Apostle of Allah would offer his prayers while Hassan and

<font color="red">Husain</font> would take turns in straddling his back. Some of the

companions of the Apostle of Allah would try to remove them

therefrom but he would respond:

</p><p align="justify"><b>"Leave them, may my father and

mother be their ransom, who ever loves me, he should love them." </b>

</p><p align="justify"><b>"Whoever is pleased to look at a

man from the people of paradise, then let him look at

<font color="red">Husain</font>."</b>

</p><p align="justify">Thus Imam <font color="red">Husain</font> was introduced to the ummah, while still in

the bloom of his childhood as a martyr. His status was identified

by the Apostle of Allah lest the ummah do him harm.

</p><p align="justify">Decades passed by. The disobedient forgot the words of the

Apostle of Allah regarding the high rank of <font color="red">Husain</font>. They caused

grief to the Apostle of Allah by brutally killing his grandson.

</p><p align="justify">"Ibn Umar reminded Muslims of this as it was reported

that, 'Once Ibn Umar was asked about the hajj (pilgrim) and

whether it was permissible to kill flies'. He retorted, "The

people of Iraq ask me about the killing of flies during hajj,

whereas they had killed the son of the daughter of the Apostle of

Allah (s)'. The Apostle of Allah referred to them as, 'My

two plants of sweet basil in this world.'

</p><p align="justify">History provides another insight, taken from Anas bin Malik,

in which he compared two scenes; the first of which was that of

the Apostle of Allah kissing <font color="red">Husain</font> on his mouth and hugging

him. The second one showed Ibn Ziyad the Umayyad governor of

Kufa, following the martyrdom of <font color="red">Husain</font>, poking the head of

<font color="red">Husain</font> which had been placed in a basin. He reported,

"After the murder of <font color="red">Husain</font> bin Ali (a), his head was

carried to Ibn Ziyad who started to poke at the teeth with his

cane and said, "He was good-looking.' 'Let me disturb you',

I said, 'I saw the Apostle of Allah kiss the place you poke at on

his mouth'." This account was reported by al-Dhah'hak.

</p><p align="justify">The Apostle of Allah said:<b>" Hassan and <font color="red">Husain</font> are two lords of the youth of
paradise." </b>
</p><p align="justify">Thus was <font color="red">Husain</font> in the heart of the Apostle of Allah and

described in his divine message. He was brought up in the noblest

and most dignified house in Islam: Namely the house of the

Apostle of Allah (s). <font color="red">Husain</font> partook of his virtues and

principles, hence he was the symbol of piety and example of

faithfulness, asceticism and worship. He was unflinching and

brave in defending the ummah and of magnificently outstanding

personality. He firmly adhered to right and was strong-willed and

never feared the censure of any censurer in defending the divine laws.

</p><p align="justify">It is because of these majestic attributes, his ingenious

personality, and his lofty social rank that <font color="red">Husain</font> was destined

to become a dynamic, active force in Islamic history and his life

a brilliant testament leaving an indelible mark on all

generations. Honour enshrined the visage, of <font color="red">Husain</font> in the heart

of every freedom-loving individual who knows humanity's real

worth and the merit of principle and values.

</p><p align="justify">The Muslims loved the household of the Prophet (s) and

revered <font color="red">Husain</font> (a) as one of the Imams from this household.

Consequently, the catastrophe of his loss set off continuous

pangs of pain in the ummah's conscience, and became a ceaseless

cause of sadness. For these reasons, this personality won the

hearts and minds of people. The magnetic power of <font color="red">Husain</font> made

emotions overflow and the hearts cling passionately to him.

Poets, generation after generation, during these fourteen

centuries created inspired verse concerning him. The wellspring

of this particular literature has yet to dry up. The poetic and

artistic depiction of deepest remorse created by that tragedy and

sacrifice are still pulsing with life.

</p><p align="justify">People wrote incessantly but the ink did not desiccate nor did

expressiveness become stale. In his name uprisings were

commenced, the spring of blood did not cease to flow, nor did the

wills of aspirants to that noble path wane. In his name slogans

were chanted and transformed into institutions that did not die.

Nor did the myriad voices echoing the magnificently grand

<font color="red">Husain</font>i uprising trail off.

</p><p><b>THE MINISTER</b>

</p><p align="justify">Muslims knew full well that it was the flesh of the Apostle of

Allah from which the blood is still gushing on the dust of

<font color="red">Karbala</font>. A heinous crime was enacted against the household of the

Prophet (s) that can never be expiated short of punishing

the enemies of Islam and reviving the values of the revolt. Thus

rebellions exploded and the penitents rose up in arms. The blood

of <font color="red">Husain</font> was the catalyst that shook the Ummayad throne and pulled it down.

</p><p align="justify">Feelings of guilt and the complex of having failed the

household of the Prophet (s) cemented in the Muslims'

conscience in the wake of <font color="red">Husain</font>'s martyrdom. As a result, men

seeking vengeance rose up and movements dedicated to punishing

the criminals were formed. This was characterized by the armed

protest of the "Tawwabeen" (penitents) and al-Mukhtar

who avenged the murder of <font color="red">Husain</font>. There was a series of

revolutions and their repercussions have yet to die down.

</p><p align="justify">Muslims have continuously sat in sessions for remembering

<font color="red">Husain</font>. They relieved the massacre of al-Taf from the very day

of <font color="red">Husain</font>'s martyrdom till the present. The wailing did not

cease and the tears did not vanish. The calamity which is still

vivid grows and interacts with the human conscience, affects the

ummah's awareness and intensifies its feelings of grief. A

literary school took shape and a <font color="red">Husain</font>i tradition evolved which

nurtures the tragedy and revives it and relates it perpetually to

successive generations. Thus was <font color="red">Karbala</font>; a brilliant torch for

revolt against tyranny, a symbol for revolutionaries, a cause for

grief and wailing. <font color="red">Husain</font> is a touchstone of love and loyalty

erected in the hearts of every noble and free man.

</p><p align="justify">He is the example for the self-conscious, uncompromising

revolutionary...the one who advocated the rights of the

oppressed. He is one of the near relatives of the Prophet whom Allah orders us to love:

</p><p align="justify"><b>"... Do not ask for any reward for it but love

for my near relatives and whoever earns good, we give him more of good therein..."</b>

</p><p align="justify"><font color="red">Husain</font> was a member of the family of the Prophet (s)

whom Allah has kept uncleanness away from:

</p><p align="justify"><b>"Allah only desires to keep away the uncleanness

from you, O people of the house! And to purify you a (through)
purifying." Holy Quran (33:33)</b>

</p><p align="justify"><font color="red">Husain</font> was one of those counted with the Messenger of Allah

(s) when the contest of prayers with the Christians of Najran was staged:

</p><p align="justify"><b>"And whoever disputes with you concerning him

(Jesus) after what has come to you of knowledge, then say: Come

let us call our sons and your sons and our women and your women

and ourselves and yourselves, then let us earnestly pray for the

curse of Allah on the liars". Holy Quran (3:61)</b>
