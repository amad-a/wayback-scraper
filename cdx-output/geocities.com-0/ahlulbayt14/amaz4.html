<p align="justify">Recently, the leading intellectual in the Catholic Church - a man by
the name of Hans - studied the Quran and gave his opinion of what he had
read. This man has been around for some time, and he is highly respected
in the Catholic Church, and after careful scrutiny, he reported his findings,
concluding, "God has spoken to man through the man, Muhammad." Again this
is a conclusion arrived at by a non-Muslim source - the very leading intellectual
of the Catholic Church himself! I do not think that the Pope agrees with
him, but nonetheless, the opinion of such a noted, repute public figure
must carry some weight in defense of the Muslim position. He must be applauded
for facing the reality that the Quran is not something which can be easily
pushed aside and that, in fact God is the source of these words. As is
evident from the aforementioned information, all of the possibilities have
been exhausted, so the chance of finding another possibility of dismissing
the Quran is nonexistent. For if the book is not a revelation, then it
is a deception; and if it is a deception, one must ask, "What is its origin"
And where does it deceive us?" Indeed, the true answers to these questions
shed light on the Quran's authenticity and silence the bitter unsubstantiated
claims of the unbelievers. Certainly, if people are going to insist that
the Quran is a deception, then they must bring forth evidence to support
such a claim. The burden of proof is on them, not us! One is never supposed
to advance a theory without sufficient corroborating facts; so I say to
them, "Show me one deception! Show me where the Quran deceives me! Show
me, otherwise, don't say that it is a deception!" An interesting characteristic
of the Quran is how it deals with surprising phenomena which relate not
only to the past but to modern times as well. In essence, the Quran is
not and old problem. It is still a problem even today - a problem to the
non-Muslims that is. For everyday, every week, every year brings more and
more evidence that the Quran is a force to be contended with - that its
authenticity is no longer to be challenged! For example, one verse in the
Quran reads;
</p><p align="justify">"Do not the unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined
together, then We clove them asunder, and made from water every living
thing? Will they not then believe?"

</p><p align="justify">Ironically, this very information is exactly what they awarded the 1973
Noble Prize for - to a couple of unbelievers. The Quran reveals the origin
of the universe - how it began from one piece - and mankind continues to
verify this revelation, even up to now. Additionally, the fact that all
life originated from water would not have been an easy thing to convince
people of fourteen centuries ago. Indeed, if 1400 years ago you had stood
in the desert and told someone, "All of this, you see (pointing to yourself),
is made up of mostly water," no one would have believed you. Proof of that
was not available until the invention of the microscope. They had to wait
to find out that cytoplasm, the basic substance of the cell, is made-up
of 80% water. Nonetheless, the evidence did come, and once again the Quran
stood the test of time. In reference to the falsification tests mentioned
earlier, it is interesting to note that they, too, relate to both the past
and the present. Some of them were used as illustrations of Allah's omnipotence
and knowledge, while others continue to stand as challenges to the present
day. An example of the former is the statement made in the Quran about
Abu Lahab. It clearly illustrates that Allah, the Knower of the Unseen,
knew that Abu Lahab would never change his ways and accept Islam. Thus
Allah dictated that he would be condemned to the Hellfire forever. Such
a chapter was both an illustration of Allah's divine wisdom and a warning
to those who were like Abu Lahab.

</p><p align="justify">An interesting example of the latter type of falsification tests contained
in the Quran is the verse which mentions the relationship between the
Muslims and the Jews. The verse is careful not to narrow its scope to the
relationship between individual members of each religion, but rather, it
summarizes the relationship between the two groups of people as a whole.
In essence, the Quran states that the Christians will always treat the
Muslims better than the Jews will treat the Muslims. Indeed, the full impact
of such a statement can only be felt after careful consideration of the
real meaning of such a verse. It is true that many Christians and many
Jews have become Muslims, but as a whole, the Jewish community is to be
viewed as an avid enemy of Islam. Additionally, very few people realize
what such an open declaration in the Quran invites. In essence, it is
an easy chance for the Jews to prove that the Quran is false - that it
is not a divine revelation. All they have to do is organize themselves,
treat the Muslims nicely for a few years and then say, "Now what does your
holy book say about who are your best friends in the world - the Jews or
the Christians? Look what we Jews have done for you!" That is all they
have to do to disprove the Quran's authenticity, yet they have not done
it in 1400 years. But, as always, the offer still stands open!

</p><p align="justify">All of the examples so far given concerning the I various angles from
which one can approach the | Quran have undoubtedly been subjective in
nature; I however there does exist another angle, among others, which is
objective and whose basis is mathematical. It is surprising how authentic
the Quran becomes when one assembles what might be referred to as a list
of good guesses. Mathematically, it can be explained using guessing and
prediction examples. For instance, if a person has two choices (i.e., one
is right, and one is wrong), and he closes his eyes and makes a choice,
then half of the time (i.e., one time out of two) he will be right. Basically,
he has a one in two chance, for he could pick the wrong choice, or he could
pick the right choice. Now if the same person has two situations like that
(i.e., he could be right or wrong about situation number one, and he could
be right or wrong about situation number two), and he closes his eyes and
guesses, then he will only be right one fourth of the time (i.e., one time
out of four). He now has a one in four chance because now there are three
ways for him to be wrong and only one way for him to be right. In simple
terms, he could make the wrong choice in situation number one and then
make the wrong choice in situation number two; OR he could make the wrong
choice in situation number one and then make the right choice in situation
number two; OR he could make the right choice in situation number one and
then make the wrong choice in situation number two; OR he could make the
right choice in situation number one and then make the right choice in
situation number two. Of course, the(only instance in which he could be
totally right is the last scenario where he could guess correctly in both
situations. The odds of his guessing completely correctly have become greater
because the number of situations for him to guess in have increased; and
the mathematical equation representing such a scenario is 1/2 x 1/2 (i.e.,
one time out of two for the first situation multiplied by one time out
of two for the second situation).

</p><p align="justify">Continuing on with the example, if the same person now has three situations
in which to make blind guesses, then he will only be right one eighth of
the time (i.e., one time out of eight or 1/2 X 1/2 X 1/2). Again, the odds
of choosing the correct choice in all three situations have decreased his
chances of being completely correct to only one time in eight. It must
be understood that as the number of situations increase, the chances of
being right decrease, for the two phenomena are inversely proportional.

</p><p align="justify">Now applying this example to the situations in the Quran, if one draws
up a list of all of the subjects about which the Quran has made correct
statements, it becomes very clear that it is highly unlikely that they
were all just correct blind guesses. Indeed, the subjects discussed in
the Quran are numerous, and thus the odds of someone just making lucky
guesses about all of them become practically nil. If there are a million
ways for the Quran to be wrong, yet each time it is right, then it is
unlikely that someone was guessing. The following three examples of subjects
about which the Quran has made correct statements collectively illustrate
how the Quran continues to beat the odds.

</p><p align="justify">In the 16th chapter the Quran mentions that the female bee leaves its
home to gather food.l2 Now, a person might guess on that, saying, "The
bee that you see flying around - it could be male, or it could be female.
I think I will guess female." Certainly, he has a one in two chance of
being right. So it happens that the Quran is right. But it also happens
that was not what most people believed at the time when the Quran was
revealed. Can you tell the difference between a male and a female bee?
Well, it takes a specialist to do that, but it has been discovered that
the male bee never leaves his home to gather food. However, in Shakespeare's
play, Henry the Fourth, some of the characters discuss bees and mention
that the bees are soldiers and have a king. That is what people thought
in Shakespeare's time - that the bees that one sees flying around are male
bees and that they go home and answer to a king. However, that is not true
at all. The fact is that they are females, and they answer to a queen.
Yet it took modern scientific investigations in the last 300 years to discover
that this is the case.

</p><p align="justify">So, back to the list of good guesses, concerning the topic of bees,
the Quran had a 50/50 chance of being right, and the odds were one in
two.

</p><p align="justify">In addition to the subject of bees, the Quran also discusses the sun
and the manner in which it travels through space. Again, a person can guess
on that subject. When the sun moves through space, there are two options:
it can travel just as a stone would travel if one threw it, or it can move
of its own accord. The Quran states the latter - that it moves as a result
of its own motion.'3 To do such, the Quran uses a form of the word sabaha
to describe the sun's movement through space. In order to properly provide
the reader with a comprehensive understanding of the implications of this
Arabic verb, the following example is given. If a man is in water and the
verb sabaha is applied in reference to his movement, it can be understood
that he is swimming, moving of his own accord and not as a result of a
direct force applied to him. Thus when this verb is used in reference to
the sun's movement through space, it in no way implies that the sun is
flying uncontrollably through space as a result of being hurled or the
like. It simply means that the sun is turning and rotating as it travels.
Now, this is what the Quran affirms, but was it an easy thing to discover?
Can any common man tell that the sun is turning? Only in modern times was
the equipment made available to project the image of the sun onto a tabletop
so that one could look at it without being blinded. And through this process
it was discovered that not only are there three spots on the sun but that
these spots move once every 25 days. This movement is referred to as the
rotation of the sun around its axis and conclusively proves that, as the
Quran stated 1400 years ago, the sun does, indeed turn as it travels through
space.

</p><p align="justify">And returning once again to the subject of good guess, the odds of guessing
correctly about both subjects - the sex of bees and the movement of the
sun - are one in four!

</p><p align="justify">Seeing as back fourteen centuries ago people probably did not understand
much about time zones, the Quran's statements about this subject are considerably
surprising. The concept that one family is having breakfast as the sun
comes up while another family is enjoying the brisk night air is truly
something to be marveled at, even in modern time. Indeed, fourteen centuries
ago, a man could not travel more than thirty miles in one day, and thus
it took him literally months to travel from India to Morocco, for example.
And probably , when he was having supper in Morocco, he thought to himself,
"Back home in India they are having supper right now." This is because
he did not realize that, in the process of traveling, he moved across a
time zone. Yet, because it is the words of Allah, the All-Knowing, the
Quran recognizes and acknowledges such a phenomenon. In an interesting
verse it states that when history comes to an end and the Day of Judgment
arrives, it will all occurring an instant; and this very instant will catch
some people in the daytime and some people at night. This clearly illustrates
Allah's divine wisdom and His previous knowledge of the existence of time
zones, even though such a discovery was non-existent back fourteen centuries
ago. Certainly, this phenomenon is not something which is obvious to one's
eyes or a result of one's experience, and this fact, in itself, suffices
as proof of the Qurans authenticity.

</p><p align="justify">Returning one final time to the subject of good guesses for the purpose
of the present example, the odds that someone guessed correctly about all
three of the aforementioned subjects - the sex of bees, the movement of
the sun and the existence of time zones - are one in eight!

</p><p align="justify">Certainly, one could continue on and on with this example, drawing up
longer and longer list of good guesses; and of course, the odds would become
higher and higher with each increase of subjects about which one could
guess. But what no one can deny is the following; the odds that Mohammed
an illiterate, guessed correctly about thousands and thousands of subjects,
never once making a mistake, are so high that any theory of his authorship
of the Quran must be completely dismissed - even by the most hostile enemies
of Islam!

</p><p align="justify">Indeed, the Quran expects this kind of challenge. Undoubtedly, if one
said to someone upon entering a foreign land, "I know your father. I have
met him," probably the man from that land would doubt the newcomer's word,
saying, "You have just come here. How could you know my father?" As a result,
he would question him, "Tell me, is my father tall, short, dark, fair?
What is he like?" Of course, if the visitor continued answering all of
the questions correctly, the skeptic would have no choice but to say, "I
guess you do know my father. I don't know how you know him, but I guess
you do!" The situation is the same with the Quran. It states that it originates
from the One who created everything. So everyone has the right to say,
"Convince me! If the author of this book really originated life and everything
in the heavens and on the earth, then He should know about this, about
that, and so on." And inevitably, after researching the Quran, everyone
will discover the same truths. Additionally, we all know something for
sure: we do not all have to be experts to verify what the Quran affirms.
One's iman (faith) grows as one continues to check and confirm the truths
contained in the Quran. And one is supposed to do so all of his life.
</p><p align="justify">May God (Allah) guide everyone close to the truth.
</p><p align="justify"><b>SUPPLEMENT:</b>
An engineer at the University of Toronto who was interested in psychology
and who had read something on it, conducted researched wrote a thesis on
Efficiency of Group Discussions. The purpose of his research was to find
out how much people accomplish when they get together to talk in groups
of two, three, ten, etc. The graph of his findings: people accomplish most
when they talk in groups of two. Of course, this discovery was entirely
beyond his expectations, but it is very old advice given in the Quran:
</p><p align="justify">"Say, 'I exhort you to one thing - that you stand for Allah, [assessing
the truth] by twos and singly, and then reflect.....' In conclusion I ask
you to consider with care the following:
</p><p align="justify">Additionally, the 89th chapter of the Quran mentions a certain city
by the name of 'Iram (a city of pillars), which was not known in ancient
history and which was non-existent as far as historians were concerned.
However, the December 1978 edition of National Geographic introduced interesting
information which mentioned that in 1973, the city of Elba was excavated
in Syria. The city was discovered to be 43 centuries old, but that is not
the most amazing part. Researchers found in the library of Elba a record
of all of the cities with which Elba had done business. Believe or not,
there on the list was the name of the city of 'Iram. The people of Elba
had done business with the people of 'Iram!
</p><p align="justify">"And they say, 'Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord?' Say,
'Indeed, the signs are with Allah, and I am but a clear warner.' But is
sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book [i.e. Quran]
which is rehearsed to them? Verily, in that is mercy and a reminder to people who believe."
