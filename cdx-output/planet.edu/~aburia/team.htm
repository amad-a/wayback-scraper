<td width="400">When patients are ready for discharge, they are competent
in self-care, but require further guidance and support. It is believed
that the outreach nurse is capable of preparing these patients for discharge
and of controlling their self-care after discharge. Using an assessment
tool, the outreach nurse determines the adequacy of a patient’s knowledge,
skills, and willingness to meet his/her self care requisites after discharge
as part of the follow-up. The outreach team initiates and maintains good
relationships with community health organizations. 
<p>The supportive education role of the rehabilitation team is basically
fulfilled through the outreach team. <bp>Members are representatives of
the medical team: 1. Physician <br>
2. Nurse<br>
3. Social worker<br>
4. Physiotherapist<br>
5. Occupational Therapist.</bp></p>

<p>The team holds weekly meetings to discuss each past week’s activities
and to plan for the coming week. </p>

<h4>Goals</h4>

<p>1. Minimize the readmission rate through the early detection of complications.<br>
2. Control/evaluate the patients self-care after discharge./<br>
3. Involve the family in caring for the patient, to provide both the patient
and family with support, and to keep the medical team well informed about
any problems and complications.<br>
4. Arrange for patient care in the community. This includes locating clinics/organizations
as close as possible to the patient’s residence and providing the patient
with adequate care plans.<br>
5. Plan and hold seminars and workshops to educate community health workers
on the concept of rehabilitation. </p>
