<td width="400">Physiotherapy is a direct form of professional health care
for patients who have temporary or permanent disabilities or suffer from
pain due to injury, disease, birth defect or loss of limb. Its emphasis
is on the quality of life and it focuses particularly on preventing handicap.and
returning the disabled to a more active productive life. 
<p>At the Center the physiotherapist is one member of the rehabilitation
team. The team’s main goal is to teach and train the patient to be as independent
as possible.</p>

<p>In the department, the emphasis is put on independence in transfers,
in maintaining or regaining good mobility of joints, standing, and ambulating
(either walking or in a wheelchair). Before treatment, the physiotherapist
assesses the patient and composes an individually designed plan of treatment.
This plan is discussed with the patient as well as with other team members.
Short- and long-term goals are defined and agreed upon. Evaluation of the
treatment is done regularly. Before discharge, the patients is assessed
again to evaluate the result of treatment. To achieve the goals, the department
works with different functions, such as:<br>
Joint mobility<br>
Muscle strength<br>
Balance<br>
Coordination<br>
Endurance<br>
Standing<br>
Walking<br>
Pain Relief</p>

<p>The Physiotherapy Department is well-equipped for all kinds of treatments
and training; e. g., ultrasound, electric stimulation, short wave Diathermy,
and cool packs, traction, suspension, pulleys, dumbbells and weights for
strengthening exercises.</p>

<p>For standing, the department is equipped with tilt-tables, standing
bars and parallel bars. If the patient needs splints or braces, he is taught
to use them and to ambulate with different kinds of walking aids, including
crutches and walkers. Our centre also cooperates with other specialized
centers to provide patients with braces and orthosis needed.</p>

<p>At the Center there is a heated pool which is part of the
treatment.</p>

<p>Sports for the disabled are yet another part of the work in the department.
The playground for outdoor activities can be used for basketball, tennis
and badminton. Indoor activities include table tennis, darts, volleyball,
swimming and weight lifting. For the patient confined to a wheelchair,
sports are very good training, especially for balance and endurance, and
strength in the upper extremities. At the same time it is an enjoyable
and recreational activity.</p>

<p>The department is now staffed with five qualified physiotherapists:
all of them local, one of them is pool attendant, "There are 4 physical
therapy assistants, one of them have a Bachelors degree in sports, all
of them are local".</p>

<p>The physical therapy department patient capacity is 25 to 30 inpatients
and up to 20 - 25 out-patients daily.</p>

<p>The staff development plan included is increasing the knowledge and
experience in the new cases had been admitted to our center which include
Spina Bidida, C.V.A., Orthopeadics, Head Injury, Amputations, and be able
to meet their physical therapy needs with good experience.</p>
