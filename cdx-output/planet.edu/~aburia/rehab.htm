2- The support of the local communities to assume full responsibility of disabled members.<br>

<h3>Role of K . Abu Raya Rehabilitation Center<br></h3>
The vision for us at Abu Raya is to ultimately develop towards the role of National Referral Center.<br>
This can be achieved by the promoting and support of Community Based Rehabilitation Program in the local commuinties.<p>

The training is based on a WHO Model, adapted to a palestinian setting.<br>
Continuing education will be further designed based upon feedback from the field.<p>
