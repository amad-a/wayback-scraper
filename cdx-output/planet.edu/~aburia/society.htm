	The Patient’s Friends Society was established in Ramallah in February 1978 by a group of health professionals in conjunction with other volunteers. The Society aims at fulfilling some of the pressing health needs of the community, particularly in the villages. Emphasis is placed on preventive medicine and some basic curative functions.<p>
	In the context of developing society and in the absence of a national government, a determined effort must be given by the Society to primary health services; i.e., mother and child health care, programs for the control and eradication of infectious diseases, and health education.</p><p>
	The society established nine clinics between the years 1982 and 1986. Eight clinics were opened in villages and one in the city of Ramallah.</p><p>
	In 1983, the Society opened a full-time Physiotherapy Center to treat acute and chronic cases referred by the Society to other clinics in the rural areas. Another special clinic to deal with diabetic cases was opened in 1990.</p><p>
	In 1990, PFS managed to open K. Abu Rayya Rehabilitation Center to deal with patients with spinal cord injuries.</p><p>
