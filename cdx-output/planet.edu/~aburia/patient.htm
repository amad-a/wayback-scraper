<center><h2>The Patient Population</h2></center>
<img src="/planet.edu/~aburia/pic3.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">Since opening ARRC for inpatients in November 1990 and up until December 1996, the Center had rehabilitated 369 patients with spinal cord injuries, spinal diseases and limb injuries. The majority of those patients (85 percent) were male, with at least 52 percent in the age group of 15-24 years.<br>
	Distribution according to residence showed that 28 percent came from cities, 47 percent from villages, and 24 percent came from refugee camps. Only 22 percent came from Gaza Strip, and this indicates that the Gaza population in under-represented.
	<p>More than half of the patients rehabilitated at ARRC (51.6 percent) were injured in violent actions;  i. e., from gunshots, beatings, or stabbing. Admissions of 1993 showed a drop in such injuries, however.

</p><center><h3>ADMISSION OF PATIENTS</h3></center>
	Admission of  patients is usually decided by the Admission Committee, which consists of the same members as the Medical Council. The committee discusses lists of potential inpatients and admission decisions are made accordingly. Potential inpatients are referred in various ways. Many come from hospitals (mainly Makassed Hospital in Jerusalem). Some are self-referred patients, while the outreach program also refers others.<p>
	Admission priority is given to spinal cord injuries.
