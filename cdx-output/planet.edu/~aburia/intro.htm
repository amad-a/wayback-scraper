Ever since the establishment of ‘Khalil Abu Raya Rehabilitation Center by Patients’ Friends Society in Ramallah, it has achieved great results through the vital services offered to the disabled Palestinians, whether as in-patients or out-patients as its therapy units and specialized clinics.
<p>
The following statistics reflect the Centers’ services up to Dec. 31, 1996.
</p><p>
<b>First:</b> 614 in-patients  received full rehabilitation services.
</p><p>
<b>Second:</b> 2533 out patients received treatment at the physiotherapy unit.
</p><p>
<b>Third:</b> 532 out patients were treated in the functional therapy unit.
</p><p>
<b>Fourth:</b> 4966 patients were treated in the specialized clinics.
</p><p>
	After reading the above statistics we can’t but appreciate the diligence and dedication of the staff and supervisors of the center.
</p><p>
	We would like to point out that all the aforementioned services were rendered of charge to those injured during the Intifada i.e. 80% of the total number of patients. In fact, the Center also provided the necessary tools needed by handicapped Palestinians free of charge. The rest of the patients received services at minimal fees that partially covered their cost.
</p><p>
	This policy is congruent with the ultimate aim of the Center i.e. to offer the best possible available services to our Palestinian people regardless of their financial status.
</p><p>
	The Center, as all our Palestinian institution, had to cope with the immense burden which tragic events incurred upon the Palestinian people, such as the Al Aqsa  massacre ( a few years ago), the Al Ibrahimim Mosque massacre in Hebron and the latest massacre Al Quds Intifada.
</p><p>
	As usual, the center was quick to respond by offering its services to the wounded Palestinians. Arrangements were made in coordination with the Ministry of Health and medical institutions to transfer the Center into an emergency center for the wounded. Staff and volunteers offered round the - clock services to treat patients who arrived either directly or were transferred from Ramallah Hospital. These arrangements, of course, facilitated the work of all emergency and first aid units active during the confrontations.
</p><p>
	When we look back at the services and functions which the center participated in during the latest confrontations as its duty and commitment towards our Palestinian people ( despite its modest means), we feel very proud of the Center’s achievements and all those working in it. The center’s achievements were mainly due to its good organization, great experience and highly qualified staff.
</p><p>
	We believe that despite the magnitude of services the center managed to offer during the past critical periods, those  services  constituted only the minimum of its obligations. Thus we approach you through this informative message, to consider the possibility of supporting the center with financial or material aid, to enable it to continue its noble task and outstanding services to our people especially at the time of distress.
</p><p>
	We are fully confident that you understand and we are aware of the center’s urgent needs and the significance of supporting this national institution.
</p><p>
	We remain grateful to you for any support you are willing to offer our Palestinian people at such difficult times.
