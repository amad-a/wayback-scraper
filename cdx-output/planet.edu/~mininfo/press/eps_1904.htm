It is now clear to all, the Americans included, that Sharon is not just refuses to arrive at a just and lasting solution based on UN resolutions with the Palestinian people, but he is effectively acting to cause a regional conflict that will engulf the whole area.  In his most recent interviews, Sharon said time and time again that he did not change, that he is against Oslo, that he is going to keep and expand Jewish settlements in the Palestinian occupied territories, that Jerusalem will remain the "eternal united capital of Israel', that he will not allow a sovereign Palestinian state to exist and never to allow Palestinian refugees to return home.   
Not just that, Sharon announced that the rule of the game has changed and immediately went into action against Syrian troops in Lebanon. While his planes were shelling Syrian and Lebanese positions Monday night, his tanks were deep in Palestinian territories wreaking havoc and destruction in Gaza.  Sharon also refused the Jordanian Egyptian initiative for a resumption of peace talks.
</p><p>
As the Independent of London said:" It is high time for the Bush Administration to make clear to Mr. Sharon that Israel's behavior is self-defeating, that violence will beget only more violence."
