<ul><li><p>
As if it is not already under siege, the Israeli occupation government announces a complete closure on the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank, Gaza and Arab east Jerusalem.
</p></li><li><p>
Israeli occupation troops commit another crime in Rafah / Gaza last night.  A bomb operated by remote control was detonated killing four Palestinian policemen and injuring six, three, of whom seriously.  <br>
Israeli tanks stationed in Jewish settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories indiscriminately shell Palestinian towns, cities and refugee camps.  Biet Jala, Hebron, Rafah, Biet hanoun, Ayda and Azza Palestinian refugee camps were shelled last night.  
The Israeli occupation forces targeted Palestinian medical teams yesterday shooting and injuring at least one of them. The medical team was trying to collect body parts of the Palestinian policemen killed in the explosion.
 </p></li><li><p>
Jewish settlers in the heart of the Palestinian city of Hebron attack Palestinian civilians, destroy businesses and journalists covering the news in the area. 
</p></li><li><p>
Poverty percentages in the West Bank and Gaza reached 55.7% of the population in the West Bank and 81.4% of the population in Gaza.  More than two million Palestinians suffer severe hardships and poverty.  Israel is conducting a systematic campaign against the Palestinian population in the occupied Palestinian territories purpose of which is to destroy the Palestinian civil society through the destruction of the Palestinian economy and hindering the education process.<br>
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian workers are hit by the Israeli closure and siege imposed on the Palestinian territories. The effect is directly and indirectly hitting the workforce and all sectors of the Palestinian economy.  The education process is being affected very badly.  <br>
The Israeli deliberate and systematic measures are slowly destroying the Palestinian society, all of this is being done by the Israeli government in a subtle and discrete way in a manner hides Israel's actions and real intentions from the world.  The Israeli propaganda machine comprised of Israeli government media campaign supported by mainly Jewish writers, journalists, analysts and public relations groups in the United States and the West in general are serving the Israeli military machine which is literally killing Palestinian men women and children, destroying homes and businesses, uprooting trees and turning fertile agricultural land into vast areas of ugly deserts, and most dangerous of all blinding people of the world from seeing the reality and the consequences of Israel's actions on the ground against a Palestinian population struggling for its freedom, independence and to end this barbaric Israeli occupation of Palestinian land in the West bank, Gaza and Arab East Jerusalem.  
</p></li><li><p>
Many distinguished European officials are visiting Palestine and Israel in an attempt to broker a solution for the current deadlock.  The foreign ministers of Belgium and Spain are currently in the area.  So far nothing tangible is being done to stop the Israeli slow genocide practiced against the Palestinian people.  The Palestinian people effectively have no hope.  The European peoples, the EU. Canada, Australia, India, China, Russia and all others are called upon to stop the Israeli ongoing savage aggression against the Palestinian people and to end the Israeli occupation of our land, because the Israeli occupation is the root of the problem and the cause of the ongoing instability in the Middle East.
</p></li><li><p>
President Mubarak of Egypt will receive the Israeli foreign minister in Cairo on Sunday.  First Sharon rejected out of hand an Egyptian Jordanian initiative to resume peace negotiations between the PNA and Israel, the European Union gave their support to the initiative and the American side did not oppose it.  On his part, Shimon Peres working as a marketing man for Sharon and his obstructive policies suggested that instead of Sharon rejecting the initiative, he should live with it and destabilize it from within through asking for changes on the terms of the initiative and eventually rendering ineffective without actually announcing his rejection to it.   On Sunday, Peres is due in Cairo to discuss changes on the initiative as Peres suggested and Sharon accepted.
