The danger to Israel's strategic and long-term interests due to Sharon's barbaric policies of murder and destruction in the occupied Palestinian territories far exceeds the dangers facing the Palestinian population in the occupied Palestinian territories.  Sharon does not have much time to stay in power in Israel, Netanyahu his competitor for the Likud leadership anticipated three months for Sharon.  Once Sharon leaves, the Israeli people will be left with a huge debt to pay particularly as Sharon is taking the area back to the seventies and before that.  In one of his interviews in the Israeli press last week Sharon was asked if Israel is living by the sword. 
<br>
Sharon dodged the question saying a civilized country can not be asked this question.  The question is, where is this civilized country 
Sharon is speaking of. A country and a people who are occupying another people, steeling their freedom, destroying their land and killing their children is no civilized country.<br>
Israel is a country with an intelligencia that supports terror, a culture based on the horrors of the Nazis, a culture that produced an army that thinks fighting the Palestinian people is like fighting Nazis forgetting that the Palestinian people are the victim, a victim of the Israeli aggression and a victim of the subsequent actions of the Nazis against the Jews.  Europe wanted to clear its conscious towards the Jews, arranged for them to create a state for them in Palestine, in the process making a whole people, the Palestinian people suffer and pay the price.  Europe should be ashamed, and the Israeli people must get rid of this monster called Sharon.
