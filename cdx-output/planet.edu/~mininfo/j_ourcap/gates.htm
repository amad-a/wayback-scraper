<h3><i>The city is surrounded by seven main gates:</i></h3>
<b>
<ul>
<li> <h4>(1) <i><u>Bab Al A’mod (Damascus Gate):</u></i></h4>
<p>It was built over the ruins of two gates; one dating back to the area  of the Roman Emperor Hadrianos who established “Alia Capitolina”, and the second to the days of Herodes Aghribas .
</p>
</li><li><h4>(2) <i><u>Bab Al-Khalil Gate (known as Jaffa Gate):</u></i></h4>
<p>It lies in the western side of the Jerusalem wall.</p>

</li><li><h4>(3-4) <i><u> Moroccan and Prophet David the Gates or (Dung Gate):</u></i></h4>
<p>Both lie in the southern part of wall.  The outside entrance (Moroccan Gate) leads directly to the inside one (Prophet David or Dung Gate). The second outlet would lead you directly to the historical Moroccan neighborhood which was demolished by Israel after occupying the city in 1967 to build modern flats 
instead . </p>

</li><li><h4>(5) <i><u>Bab Al-Esbat (known as Lions Gate):</u></i></h4>
<p>It lies in the estern fringes of the Jerusalem wall and is the nearest to Al-Aqsa Mosque .</p>

</li><li><h4>(6) <i><u>Al-Bab Al-Jadid (known as the New Gate):</u></i></h4>
<p>It lies in the northern part of the wall and west of Damascus Gate. It was built by the German Emperor Geiliom II who visited Jerusalem in 1898 .
</p>
</li><li><h4>(7) <i><u>Bab Assahira (known as Herodes Gate):</u></i></h4>
