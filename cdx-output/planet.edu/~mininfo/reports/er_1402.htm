<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="+3" color="RED"><i>The</i></font> forces of the Zionist gangs Tsel, Irgun and Hagana, fitted out with the Zionist 
 terrorist strategy of killing civilians in order to achieve their aspirations, began 
 stealing into the village on the night of April 9, 1948. Their purpose was to uproot the 
 Palestinian people from their land by coming upon the inhabitants of the village 
 unawares, destroying their homes and burning them down on top of those inside, 
 thereby making clear to the entire world to what depths of barbarism Zionist had 
 sunk. The attack began as the children were asleep in their mothers' and fathers' 
 arms. In the words of Menachim Begin as he described events, "the Arabs fought 
 tenaciously in defense of their homes, their women and their children." 
</p><p>The fighting  proceeded from house to house, and whenever the Jews occupied a house, they 
 would blow it up, then direct a call to the inhabitants to flee or face death. Believing 
 the threat, the people left in terror in hopes of saving their children and women. But 
 what should the Stern and Irgun gangs do but rush to mow down whoever fell within 
 range of their weapons. <br>Then, in a picture of barbarism the likes of which humanity 
 has rarely witnessed except on the part of the most depraved, the terrorists began 
 throwing bombs inside the houses in order to bring them down on whoever was 
 inside. The orders they had received were for them to destroy every house. Behind 
 the explosives there marched the Stern and Irgun terrorists, who killed whoever they 
 found alive. The explosions continued in the same barbaric fashion until the 
 afternoon of April 10, 1948.Then they gathered together the civilians who were still 
 alive, stood them up beside the walls and in corners, then fired on them.8 About 
 twenty-five men were brought out of the houses, loaded onto a truck and led on a 
 "victory tour" in the neighborhood of Judah Mahayina and Zakhroun Yousif. At the 
 end of the tour, the men were brought to a stone quarry located between Tahawwu'at 
 Shawul and Dair Yasin, where they were shot in cold blood. Then the Etsel and Layhi 
 "fighters" brought the women and the children who had managed to survive up to a 
 truck and took them to the Mendelbaum Gate.<br> Finally, a Hagana unit came and dug 
 a mass grave in which it buried 250 Arab corpses, most of them women, children 
 and the elderly.</p><p> 
 A woman who survived the massacre by the name of Halima Id describes what 
 happened to her sister. <br>She says, <i>"I saw a soldier grabbing my sister, Saliha 
 al-Halabi, who was nine months pregnant. He pointed a machine gun at her neck, 
 then emptied its contents into her body. Then he turned into a butcher, and grabbed 
 a knife and ripped open her stomach to take out the slaughtered child with his 
 iniquitous Nazi knife.</i>"</p><p>
 In another location in the village, Hanna Khalil, a girl at the  time, saw a man unsheathing a large knife and ripping open the body her neighbor  Jamila Habash from head to toe. Then he murdered their neighbor Fathi in the same 
 way at the entranceway to the house. A 40-year-old woman named Safiya  describes how she was come upon by a man who suddenly opened up his trousers  and pounced on her. <br><i>"I began screaming and wailing. But the women around me 
 were all meeting the same fate. After that they tore off our clothes so that they could 
 fondle our breasts and our bodies with gestures too horrible to describe." </i><br>
Some of  the soldiers cut off women's ears in order to get at a few small earrings.
 Once news of the massacre had gotten out, a delegation from the Red Cross tried to 
 visit the village. However, they weren't allowed to visit the site until a day after the 
 time they had requested. Meanwhile the Zionists tried to cover up the evidence of 
 their crime. They gathered up as much as they could of the victims' dismembered 
 corpses, threw them in the village well, then closed it up. And they tried to change the 
 landmarks in the area so that the Red Cross representative wouldn't be able to find 
 his way there. However, he did find his way to the well, where he found 150 maimed 
 corpses belonging to women, children and the elderly. And in addition to the bodies 
 which were found in the well, scores of others had been buried in mass graves while 
 still others remained strewn over street corners and in the ruins of houses.</p><p>
 Afterwards, the head of the terrorist Hagana gang which had taken part in burying the 
 Palestinian civilians wrote saying that his group had not undertaken a military 
 operation against armed men, the reason being that they wanted to plant fear in the 
 Arabs' hearts. This was the reason they chose a peaceable, unarmed village, since 
 in this way they could spread terror among the Arabs and force them to flee.
