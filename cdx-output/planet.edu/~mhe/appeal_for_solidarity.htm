<p align="JUSTIFY">The Palestinian Ministry of Higher Education as it strongly condemns
Israel’s latest terrorist and brutal attacks against Palestinian institutions of the
College of Education in Gaza and Palestine Technical College/Kaduri in Tulkarem urges the
international community and Palestinian friends everywhere to condemn such attacks and to
pressure the Israeli government to stop its aggression and violence against the
Palestinian people and their institutions.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Israel, in its latest attempt to destroy Palestinian will, used all
means available tanks, planes and man-power to shell two Palestinian Higher Education
institutions in the West Bank and Gaza destroying their buildings. </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This attack is only one of the many daily oppressive measures the
Israeli government exercises on Palestinians that reveal time and time again Israel’s
lack of commitment to peace and their violation of Palestinian basic human rights. </p>
</font><font face="Arial">

</font><p><font face="Arial"></font><big><font face="Arial Narrow">The Ministry of Higher Education cannot emphasize
enough the need for all supporters of justice and human rights to put an end to all
Israeli aggressions against Palestinian institutions and people. </font></big></p>
