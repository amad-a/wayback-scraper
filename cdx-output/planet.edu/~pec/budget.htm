<h3><i><u>Budget</u>
</i></h3>
<h4><dt>The operating costs of PEC are covered by the budget allocated to the Center by the 
European Commission through bilateral protocols and by<br> the funds raised from 
international cooperation. PEC is planning to have some income generating activities. The 
programmes and projects identified by PEC and its partners are financed by various 
donors through bilateral protocols signed by the Palestinian National Authority and the 
concerned international partners. The Center receives financing through different Euro-
Mediterranean programmes that are financed by the EC like THERMIE, SYNERGY, 
JOULE, etc, and other donors.
