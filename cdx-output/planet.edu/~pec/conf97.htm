This conference will be held in a time while Palestinians are preparing to declare their Independent
State as the Interim Agreement stated and that will be in May  1999.  This stage must include the
formation and establishment of all national projects such as Ports, Airports,  Power
Generationetc.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Due to the tremendous challenges that the Palestinian National Authority has faced as a result of
obstacles imposed by the Israeli government  as well as not implementing the most  items in the
Interim Agreement.   It is essential not only to focus on scientific research and objective studies
based on well organized methodology but also direct their desired results,  recommendations,  and
proposed solutions towards solving all relevant problems that face development and
reconstruction.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
</p><p>Since the reconstruction of the nation requires special attention to be directed to the Palestinian
economy,  efficient programs and proper planning must be designed to achieve sustainable
development and recovery.  This needs identification and assessment of the Palestinian demands
on Energy-the, backbone of the economic development in the environmental protection, 
therefore,  the importance of organizing this conference stems from focusing our efforts and
research on prospective future as well as the study of the environment in order to identify its
profile and pinpoint the future dangers that might face it.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
</p><p>The Palestinian Energy and Environment Research Center,  Engineers Association / Jerusalem
Center,  and An-Najah National University have decided to organize and prepare for the Third
conference "Energy and Environment in Palestine: Challenges for Development and
Reconstruction".

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
</p><p>The previous two conferences resulted in many positive developments in the energy-environment
Sector.  Actually,  most of the recommendations of the conferences translated into policies and
programs that are  under implementation from creating the distribution utilities to the signing of
the letter of Sector Policy by President Arafat.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
</p><p>We sincerely hope that this conference will follow the previous ones in identifying and forecasting
the problems that the new Independent State will be facing and to put forth the suitable solutions
that could help in developing our human and financial resources, reducing the environmental
hazard, and employing the best methodology in production and economic growth.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
</p><p><strong>GOALS OF THE CONFERENCE</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
</p><p>1-   To help formulate a strategy for development through  studying energy and environmental
possibilities in Palestine.

</p><p>2-   To identify and study traditional and renewable energy  sources in Palestine.

</p><p>3-   To study and evaluate the environmental status in Palestine, its main profile,  and the danger
resulting from  environmental deterioration to formulate strategies to  protect the Palestinian
environment for the future generation.

</p><p>4-   To contribute in infusing scientific awareness to identify the problems resulting from energy
usage and their effect on  the environment and the energy resources.

</p><p>5-   To apply the principle of scientific research planning and development processes through
