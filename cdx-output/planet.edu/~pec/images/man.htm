The Palestinian National Authority (PNA), has showed a great interest in the development 
and usage of renewable energy issues, in addition to energy conservation.<p>

The Palestinian Energy and Environment Research Center  ( PEC )  was established in 
December 1993 in Jerusalem, in accordance with the decision of His Excellency President 
Yasser Arafat, President of Palestine,  in order to prepare studies and proposals about the 
needs of the Palestinian community for energy resources, traditional and non- traditional.  
PEC as a national independent organization has a full authorities and responsibility in the 
issues of energy and related  environment, and to take care of the development of 
renewable energy issues, as well as energy conservation.</p><p>

In July 1996, The center became part of the President’s Office, and subject to the 
decisions made by the President himself.  The President has emphasized this relationship in 
many occasions, the last of these was in his historical speech in the Solar Summit in 
Harare, Sept.16.1996, in which he said: “ The Palestinian Energy and Environment 
Research Center was established by a Presidential decision to take care of the 
development of the renewable energy and energy conservation issues” The Center has 
finished the plans and studies to provide electricity to the remote communities in Palestine, 
by using the Solar, Wind and Biomass energy. By this time,  nine locations including 
schools and clinics, had been provided by using Solar energy.  The success of this project 
has a very substantial effect on the life of those communities.</p><p>

Moreover,  the center has began another national project for three years, in which 200 
KWp of Solar energy will be installed in Palestine, this project is considered one of  the 
biggest in the Middle East.<br>
