                <p>Dear Friends of PACE, <br>
                Dear Friends of the Palestinian people,</p>
                <p>Three days ago, the UN Commission on Human
                Rights endorsed a resolution condemning the
                disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force
                by Israel against the Palestinian civilians. The
                commission called for the creation of an
                international human rights team of inquiry to
                gather and compile information on the violations
                of human rights in the occupied Palestinian
                territories and provide the Commission with its
                conclusions and recommendations. A day later the
                UN general assembly also condemned Israel for its
                oppressive policies against the Palestinian
                people.</p>
                <p>The Israeli response to those resolutions was
                no different from its response to a similar
                resolution passed by the UN Security Council a
                week ago, and all previous UN resolutions. Total
                defiance of international will, international
                law, and legitimacy. Actually the Israeli cruelty
                against the Palestinians intensified during the
                past few days. Last Saturday, the Israeli army
                shot and killed 10 people and wounded more than
                270 people. This week was much more violent than
                the previous two weeks of the intefada. This was
                the kind of Israeli compliance with international
                law and legitimacy that the world is used to. </p>

                        <td valign="top">In the city of Nablus
                        alone, four people were killed in one

                        injured. Many of the wounded were in
                        critical condition, and two of them died
                        today in hospital. The pictures that were

                <p>15. Another child from al-Amari refugee camp
                was shot and killed during the huge demonstration
                (over 20,000 people) that the city of Ramallah
                witnessed on that same day. More than 160 people
                were wounded during this peaceful demonstration.
                Many members of PACE who were in the
                demonstration reported that the Israeli army was
                shooting live pullets indiscriminately at the
                demonstrators. </p>
                <p>The current Palestinian intifada which started
                as a cry against Sahron's visit to the Haram Al
                Sharif area in Jerusalem has now been transformed
                into a war of independence from a 32 years of
                oppressive occupation. Israel is decided to
                commit genocide and ethnic cleansing in the
                occupied Palestinian lands in an effort to
                prolong its occupation. It is a real genocide
                against a people whose only mistake is to rise up
                for its freedom. And unless the Israeli
                oppressive measures are stopped by the Arab world
                and the international community, the Israeli army
                and the settlers will intensify their efforts to
                get rid once and for all from all Palestinians
                from the West Bank and Gaza Strip and may be from
                Israel itself too. </p>
                <p>The Palestinian people should not be left
                alone to face the Israeli occupation army which
                is armed to the teeth by all kinds of inhuman and
                modern military equipment. Israel should be
                classified as an outlaw state, and the
                Palestinian people should be granted
                international protection pending the
                establishment of a state of their own. </p>
