                November 9, 2000 <p>Dear Friends of PACE, <br>
                Dear Friends of the Palestinian people, </p>
                <p>We are sorry for the delay in our briefings.
                Sometimes we get caught in the struggle like
                every body else, and that keeps us from writing
                to you. We have been lately very busy
                interviewing the families of the martyrs and
                injured and documenting the events of the
                Intifada. We will soon start sending you
                interviews with the mothers and the fathers of
                young Palestinian martyrs. </p>
                <p>That the media is not paying as much attention
                as before to the events in the occupied
                territories does not mean that the Israeli
                occupation army has stopped his aggression
                against the Palestinian civilians. In fact the
                demonstrations and clashes persist all over the
                Palestinian territories sustained by the Israeli
                military occupation of our land. The number of
                deaths and injuries did not decrease, and the
                nightly shelling of the civilian houses all over
                the Palestinian land continues. The shelling has </p>

                        neighborhoods in the Palestinian cities
                        into ruins as if we were in real war. The
                        Jewish settlers also pursued their wicked
                        work in cutting and burning Palestinian
                        trees and destroying Palestinian
                        farmland, always under the protection of
                        the Israeli occupation army. </td>

                <p>The Israeli occupation army is still
                encircling the Palestinian cities and villages.
                The different barricades aim at humiliating the
                Palestinians and hindering them from living a
                normal life. A person from Hebron stopped at a
                checkpoint at the entrance of Ramallah would be
                treated as if he was breaking the law by being
                there. It is a psychological pressure that aims
                at making the Palestinians reluctant from moving
                between the cities, as if the Israeli army is
                preparing for a real geographic separation of the
                different Palestinian districts. The curfew on
                certain villages and the old city of Hebron has
                been maintained almost continuously since the
                beginning of the Intifada. The old city of Hebron
                counts more than 40 thousand Palestinians who
                were locked up in their houses to satisfy the
                racist needs of some four hundred Jewish settlers.
                </p>
                <p>A new development that was applied by the
                Israeli occupation army is the shelling of
                hospitals, medical centers, and cars circulating
                in the streets of the cities from helicopters.
                Yesterday night a hospital was shelled in Hebron,
                and one young person who was injured in his leg a
                few days ago by an Israeli bullet received
                another Israeli bullet in his hand this time
                while he was lying in his bed at that hospital.
                Today a Palestinian civilian car that was driving
                on a main road in the city of Beit Sahour (east
                of Bethlehem) with five people inside (including
                a woman and children according to eyewitnesses)
                was chosen as a target by an Israeli military
                helicopter. The car was was completely destroyed.
                One person was killed and five were injured. The
                shelling also damaged nearby private cars and
                houses. </p>
                <p>Today medical staff and ambulances organized a
                march from the Red Cresent Society in Al-Bireh
                City to the Red Cross in Ramallah City. They
                called for protection from Israeli attacks that
                do not spare any of those who, from the Red
                Crescent or the Red Cross, try to help evacuate
                or give first aid to the Palestinian injured. Not
                only that, but also the hospitals and the medical
                centers have become a target for the shelling
                from helicopters and tanks. </p>
