                <td background="http://www.planet.edu/~pace/back.gif">Ramallah,
                October 27, 2000 <p>Dear Friends of PACE, <br>
                Dear Friends of the Palestinian people, </p>
                <p>Since the beginning of the uprising, 28 days
                ago, many Palestinian localities have been
                subject to strict curfews. Such localities, as
                the old city of Hebron and the village of Hewara
                (near Nablus), have suffered tremendously from
                this measure. Reports from the besieged villages
                and city reveal that the people are in great
                danger. Their food supplies are diminishing, and
                many families do not have basic food supplies.
                They can eat once a day only, and their meal
                consists of light soup and bread. Pregnant women
                have pregnancy interruptions because they cannot
                receive necessary medical care. Schools in these
                localities have been closed ever since the
                beginning of the uprising. Further more, at
                night, the Israeli army and the settlers shell
                the civilian houses through helicopters and tanks
                which causes a lot of damage in the simple
                buildings making them inhabitable, especially at
                this cold and rainy time of the year. During one
                of these attacks that took place a day before
                yesterday a 60 year old man, and a father of 5
                children was killed in Hebron. </p>
                <p>Since the beginning of the Intifada the
                Israeli occupation army imposed a strict closure
                on the Palestinian cities, villages and refugee
                camps. This closure means that the people cannot
                go from one place to another for work, study,
                visit relatives or to hospital. For a person who
                works on daily basis, not being able to reach
                work means that there is no money to buy food for
                the family, and in general a medium Palestinian
                family is a family of seven persons. Studying has
                also become rather a difficult task especially
                for university students. On one hand you have
                students who cannot leave their places of
                residence. Other students are delayed or
                forbidden from reaching their classes by at least
                one of the successive Israeli check points. Most
                Palestinians have lost family direct contacts,
                the only means of communications between members
                of a family is the telephone, and this increases
                the stress and psychological pressure on the
                people. Sick people are not always able to reach
                hospitals, or cannot reach one on time. Many
                Palestinian lives have been lost because an
                ambulance could not reach the patient, or because
                the ambulance needed something like sixty minutes
                to reach a hospital which is only five minutes
                away; at each roadblock, soldiers swing open the
                vehicle doors and peep inside. In fact the only
                persons who are free to travel from one place to
                another are the settlers. </p>
                <p>The irrational aggression of the Israeli
                occupation army does not know any limits. In
                addition to the closure, the shelling by
                helicopters and tanks, and the attacks of the
                armed settlers against the Palestinian civilians
                every where. The demolishing of Palestinian
                houses to "better protect" the Jewish
                settlers, the Israeli occupation army has
                destroyed large areas of agricultural lands which
                are the main source of food for the Palestinian
                population. In the Gaza strip alone they
                destroyed more than 200 acres of cultivated land.
                In other places the Israeli occupation army and
                the settlers are hindering the people from
                harvesting their olive trees, which is a major
                product in Palestine on the income of which many
                families depend for a whole year. In fact in some
                cases the Israeli occupation army just solves the
                "problem" by uprooting the Olive trees.
                </p>
                <p>The latest project of the evil newly formed
                Israeli unity government, a military government
                in fact, is the separation between the Israelis
                and the Palestinians. What the two Israeli
                generals, Barak and Sharon, mean is the creation
                of bantustans. The Palestinians will be confined
                in isolated zones the total area of which will
                not exceed 40% of the area of the West Bank and
                Gaza Strip. Each zone will have one or more
                access gates as the only passageways for
                Palestinians and their merchandise, of course
                controlled by the Israeli occupation army. This
                is the only solution these two faces of Zionism,
                Barak and Sharon, can accept for the Palestinian
                problem; because they cannot incarcerate all
                Palestinians they decided to imprison them, each
                where he/she lives. </p>
                <p>After all this the USA, which considers itself
                the defender of human rights and freedom all over
                the globe, decides that the Palestinians are
                responsible. In fact they are not different from
                the late Israeli prime minister Golda Meir who
                declared that she could not forgive the
                Palestinians because they made Israeli soldiers
                shoot them. The Israeli occupation army is
                killing the Palestinians, demolishing their
                houses, destroying their crops, sacking their
                lands, pushing them to starvation, imprison those
                who could survive, and the USA is asking the
                Palestinians, the offended, to stop the offensive
                carried out by Israel. The Palestinians now
                believe that the International law and human
                values are just a philosophic exercise. </p>
