                <td background="file:///C:/back.gif">Ramallah,
                October 16, 2000<p>Dear Friends of PACE, <br>
                Dear Friends of the Palestinian people, </p>
                <p>Today's funeral procession of <em>Raed Yaqoub
                Hammoudeh</em>, the thirty-one-year old martyr in
                Ramallah sounded like a referendum on the summit
                of Sharm al-Sheikh. </p>
                <p><em>Raed Hammoudeh</em> left behind a wife and
                two children, the older one is a three-year old
                girl, and seven brothers; three of them are in
                Ramallah hospital recovering from injuries by
                Israeli bullets they endured the same day that
                Raed was shot dead.</p>
                <p>Slogans chanted during the procession clearly
                reflect the Palestinian mood and position towards
                today's summit. Thousands of demonstrators
                chanted against the summit and the US, Husni
                Mubarak, president of Egypt, and Arafat. They
                described the summit as being a conspiracy
                against the Intifada and the upcoming Arab summit.
                Most Palestinians strongly believe that this
                Intifada is the right path to follow towards
                ending Israeli occupation of the West Bank (Jerusalem
                included) and the Gaza Strip. The aim of the
                summit as they say it, is to end the "violence"
                and return to the status quo, something that they
                can not tolerate.</p>
                <p>The closure imposed on Palestinian cities,
                villages, and refugee camps is still on. Martyrs
                of a second type are being added every day to the
                list of martyrs killed by Israeli bullets.
                Yesterday a pregnant woman from Jericho lost he
                baby on an Israeli military barrier imposing the
                closure </p>

                        a man died in Salfit because the Israeli

                        did not allow him to go to the nearest
                        hospital for dialyses. A driver was
                        wounded as he was trying to leave his
                        village which is under siege to buy food
                        supplies for his family from the
                        neighboring town. Several </td>

                <p>Arab countriesare willing to host injured
                Palestinians by the Israeli army in their
                hospitals, but no one is allowed to cross the
                border because all the border crossings to the
                outside world are closed. </p>
                <p>The life of the Palestinian is totally
                dependent on the good well of the Israeli
                occupation army. This is the legacy of Oslo,
                whose only achievement was locking the
                Palestinians in a big jail, and handing the key
                to Israel. If a Palestinian shows his discontent
                with occupation, he must suffer, and even die. In
                the twenty-first century slavery is still
                exercised by Israel, which is protected by the
                "free world". Kofi Anan showed extreme
                empathy towards two Israeli soldiers who were
                killed in Ramallah the other day, but none to the
                over 100 Palestinian martyrs. The White House and
                congress demanded that the Palestinians stop the
                violence, and withdraw their stones to their
                bases. It remains to be demanded from Israel to
                stop shelling rockets on Palestinian cities, and
                to withdraw their tanks and helicopters to their
                bases.</p>
                <p>The Palestinians strongly believe that the
                western world, and particularly the US, does not
                care about the Palestinians because of their
                unconditional support for Israel. They also
                believe that the bulk of the public opinion in
                the west is sympathetic with Israel despite its
                cruel policies against them. But they feel that
                they at least have the support of the people of
                the Arab and Moslem worlds. The west still has to
                show its support for the just cause of the
                Palestinian people, and we call upon all our
                friends in the west to raise their voice for
                peace and justice for all. </p>
