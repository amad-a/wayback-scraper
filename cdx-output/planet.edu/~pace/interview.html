                <p>More testimonies, documented by PACE, are soon
                to follow. </p>
                <p>Q.: Is it true that Palestinian parents push
                their children at an early age (14 and 15) into
                clashes with heavily armed Israeli soldiers while
                being unprepared for such an unmatched
                confrontation which will result in their death? </p>
                <p>A.: I did not know that Mohammad was going to
                participate in the clashes. Had I known I would
                have prevented him from doing so. He told me he
                was going to play with his friends, and it was
                still morning… or early noon. There were no
                clashes or confrontations to be concerned about
                and therefore no reason for me to forbid him from
                going out. Had there been any serious clashes I
                would have done anything possible to keep him at
                home because my son is the dearest thing in my
                life. God knows how much we suffer to bring them
                up, and how much we endure until they grow up. He
                was the closest to me among my children, the most
                affectionate, and the youngest, and he died just
                like this without any reason. I still had hopes
                that he would grow up, be educated and fight
                against the Jews using his education not arms
                because it is difficult for us to get arms. We
                struggle all our lives so that our children get a
                decent education and fight with their knowledge,
                their education is their weapon. But Mohammad,
                God's peace be with him, believed he was old
                enough to undertake what he did without
                consulting with his father or mother, or any body.
                He went out like all other youngsters; he felt he
                could do anything. He was not throwing stones
                when he died, he was helping the injured. He was
                a Boy Scout and he wanted to be were he was
                before he passed away. </p>
                <p>Q.: Do you think you were vigilant enough in
                trying to prevent what happened to him, or
                perhaps you did not do your best? </p>
                <p>A.: More than necessary. I always protected
                him, especially him. I was afraid especially for
                Mohammad because he was young and did things not
                for his age; it was always like that with him. I
                care for them all (my children). I always did,
                since their birth until they grow up. The most
                precious thing is your child, nothing is more
                precious for us, and I care for them, I always
                have. We used to live in Kuwait and we left. I
                asked to leave because I was afraid for them from
                the smoke of the petrol, from the war, and from
                the accumulation of the refuse in Kuwait. I was
                afraid they would get sick. I left the richest
                country in the world and came back here to
                protect them. It is unthinkable to see them die
                for any reason. All my life I cared for them.
                Even on his way to school I used to urge him
                every morning: take care Hammoudeh (diminutive of
                Mohammad), be careful from the cars, be careful…,
                where ever he went and consistently. He was even
                mad with me and used to tell me: you are always
                afraid for us. I used to behave the same way with
                his older brothers. I mean from the day the child
                grows up enough to be able to go out I am afraid
                for him. I am afraid for him from the cars, from
                the cold weather. Every morning when he went out
                to school in cold weather I used to get anxious
                about whether he did or did not put his jacket. I
                followed him and asked him: have you got your
                jacket on Mohammad? I cared for him all my life,
                and I do for his brothers. This is not something
                new, I mean. They are the most precious thing for
                me, they are the most precious, and we do not own
                anything else: no land and no homeland, nothing
                but my children, they are all my life. They are
                my children, everything I have in this world.
                When Mohammad passed away it was as if my soul
                went away with him. I felt a piece of my heart
                left with him. I mean my heart was torn apart.
                His older brothers are aware and they can decide…
                they know what to do, but Mohammad was young, and
                used to feel as old as his brothers. I cared for
                them since the day I bring them to the world.
                Until the moment of my death I will care for them.
                I own nothing but them. Maybe this (incident)
                gives us the strength to offer our children
                because there is no other way or possibility to
                take back our country and retrieve our dignity
                and land without them. We have no weapons,
                nothing but our children with whom we fight. They
                are the most precious thing we possess. There is
                no peace, there are no weapons, there is nothing.
                I mean there is nothing but our children, they
                are our capital, and there is nothing but them. </p>
                <p>Q.: Does this mean that you are ready to
                repeat this experience? Your husband told us that
                he was ready to carry a weapon and fight, and
                even you would carry a weapon and fight against
                the occupation. What is your answer? Has not your
                pain from your martyred son Mohammad and your
                fear for your other children stopped you from
                this practice? </p>
                <p>A.: If there were weapons, and we get support
                like Israel may be. But that my son dies throwing
                stones, this is not my intention. I do not obtain
                my children on the road and it is hard to lose
                more than one (of your children). Mohammad is
                enough, and he chose his way. Mohammad was young
                but the stone he threw represented for him his
                dignity. I mean he was facing his enemy; in his
                perception he was beating the enemy with a stone.
                The stone could reach (the Israeli soldier) or
                not reach (him), but Mohammad was manifesting
                something inside him with the only way available,
                the method he watched on TV. On the other hand we
                used to tell him about our homeland and the dear
                land we cherish. The least he could do was
                through a stone. Mohammad, God's peace be upon
                him. But I do not want my other children, the
                older, to participate in this battle unless the
                fighting with Israel becomes balanced and they
                carry weapons. If all of us (the Arabs) come
                together in this, I do not have any reservations.
                I would be the first to participate, just let
                them call upon us. But with the stone I do not
                agree. If there were any people who would stand
                by us the same way the USA does with Israel, and
                we got weapons like Israel, there would be
                nothing wrong with that, we would be on an equal
                basis. But if they (Israelis) fight us who have
                stones only God be with them (my children), if
                they participate with no weapons or power like
                Israel. A lot of youngsters became martyrs like
                Mohammad. They did what the Arab tanks and all
                the Arab countries did not do. This is something
                remarkable, but we must not sacrifice the young
                for nothing, something must be achieved. Blood is
                not "free", and we do not bring up our
                children so that they pass away cheaply. They (the
                martyrs) did something, something very important,
                but what we need is something greater than the
                present achievements, and we do not want to
                restart from the beginning. I mean the stone will
                revive the (first) seven-year Intifada and we
                will restart from the beginning, and if they stop
                it now it will still be the same situation. This
                is not what we are looking for, we want to
                proceed; we want to free and build a country, not
                slaughter them (our children). No. We do not want
                to restart from the beginning. We want a country
                like Israel, or not exactly like Israel, I would
                say like any other neighboring Arab country. We
                might unite with them (the Arab countries), and
                we might stand up together, the women before the
                men. </p>
                <p>Q: Forming some sort of front against Israel
                with Arab countries such as Syria and Egypt is
                not possible, neither at the present, nor in the
                foreseeable future. Does this mean that struggle
                should be ceased? </p>
                <p>A: No, we will not stop the struggle. I am not
                putting so much hope in the Arabs. If they had
                had the intention, they would have done it on the
                first day of Indifadah. On the very first day
                when the young men hoisted the flag on Al-Aqsa
                Mosque, all Arabs should have come here in that
                same moment. If every Arab country sent one
                vehicle, they could have destroyed Israel. But
                those Arabs are not useful. Currently, the
                command and control is in the hands of the
                Palestinian Authority. They are the ones who
                should recruit the young men. Whoever loves to
                die as a martyr, the Authority should train and
                teach him. The resistance in Lebanon liberated
                the South completely. Were the Authority
                responsive to us, like the resistance actions in
                the South, our young men would have achieved the
                same results. I mean their weapons were not only
                the rocks and simple things. They can be
                gathered, trained and made ready for resistance.
                When they go to school, these young men throw
                stones. They have no experience or knowledge. The
                settlements are spread all over the country. If
                they just attacked one settlement, the Jews would
                not have been hanging around us. Now the rule is
                by the hands of the Palestinian Authority, by the
                hands of Abu Ammar. He should train his sons, the
                young men. He should deal with them as if they
                were his own children. He should not only watch
                them on TV while being massacred every day. He
                should have a goal through them. I mean they are
                his weapon. Those martyrs are his weapon. He
                should try to get them together, arrange and
                organize them. He will witness something stronger
                than arms as a result. We must be armed and this
                is not difficult. If only every Arab country had
                sent a vehicle, a tank, or a plane on that day
                when the flag was hoisted on Al-Aqsa Mosque, then
                Al-Aqsa would have been liberated. When Abu Ammar
                sees the blood of the young men being shed with
                no advantage gained, he should hold them and get
                them trained. He should create something bigger
                out of them. If trained, those young men will
                turn out to be some thing far bigger. </p>
                <p>Q: I want to ask you a difficult question. I
                know it will make you remember cruel events,
                since the death of child is an unbearable thing.
                I am really aware that your own death is one
                hundred times easier than your son's.
                Nevertheless, how did this terrible incident take
                place, and how did you endure it? How did you
                accept it? </p>
                <p>A: I got to the point where I called his name
                out, as if there were only one Mohammad in the
                entire world. I would shout in the streets, and
                call his name out. I was being abnormal. The kids
                from our neighborhood came forward and said
                " We are all your children". I mean,
                every young man, every boy, big or small came to
                tell me: " I am like your son". This is
                because Mohammad became a martyr at the beginning
                of the confrontations. His death as a martyr was
                hard for everybody. I thank God that I have faith.
                Everybody turns to his faith and belief, and
                recalls what his religion says about martyrs. It
                has a lot of benefits and virtues. May God grant
                him patience, as if he were actually alive in the
                best of his hours. He is Mohammad. He is alive.
                But at the beginning it was hard, very hard. I
                wish it were a dream. I know my wish is
                impossible. All the care and concern I had for
                him has vanished. Alas. Even though Mohammad was
                fourteen years old, he used to sleep by my side.
                All my concern for him vanished….. Mohammad
                has gone away like I do not know about it. Our
                religion, I thank God, makes us patient. We
                recite the holy Quran on him, and contemplate
                God's verses. We recall what God does for the
                martyr and God's rewards for him. This has had a
                great impact on me. </p>
                <p>Q: Do you accept it as an easy matter that
                Mohammad died as a martyr, even at an early age? </p>
                <p>A: When you are a Moslem, a true believer and
                a believer in fate and the Quran, then you would
                consider dying as a martyr is the best death and
                an a honorable one. Since we are believers who
                pray, fast and worship God, we should believe in
                every single word in the Quran. Dying a martyr is
                the sweetest and most honorable death. When
                Mohammad went out and died as a martyr, it is
                because he loved to die as a martyr. He always
                mentioned those who died as martyrs. I used to
                explain the Quranic verses to him as normal
                school lessons. At school he was taught these
                subjects and he liked them very much. He used to
                understand and even appreciate them. In other
                words, he went out to become a martyr. Maybe God
                the Almighty made him go to that place. He wanted
                to come back. He went out feeling that he was in
                a battle, like any other young man. But he had in
                mind to come back, because he rolled up his
                sleeves and his pants to keep them clean. This
                means he wanted to come back and narrate what had
                happened. Mohammad used to tell me exactly what
                happened when he returns from any place. He used
                to tell me so and so happened. He never hid
                anything. He witnessed many exciting things. He
                very much wanted to tell what he had seen, but
                his fate did not give him the chance to come back
                and tell. </p>
                <p>Q: When someone's child dies, even if the
                death was natural, he does not have so much time
                to think of his problem at first. This is because
                of the presence of crowds of people around him,
                who come to console him, and in the case of a
                martyr more crowds are there. Later, people go
                back to their busy daily life, and there the real
                suffering begins, the mother's in specific. Have
                you gone through this experience and how was it.
                How did you handle that? </p>
                <p>A: This is what I wanted to talk a bout. When
                people stopped coming to our house, and no one
                was around, I started walk back and forth inside
                the house crying. I can not open his wardrobe and
                remember what Mohammad used to like or dislike. I
                remember his movements and all his belongings.
                When I hear the scouts' music on TV, I get
                touched very much. When his sister got up to go
                to school, I recalled how I used to wake him up,
                but this time he was not there. He was the
                youngest and filled up my world. His brothers
                were older, and did what they wanted on their own.
                But I used to do every thing for him. I used to
                teach him , dress him up and pick out his clothes.
                His death as a martyr was the hardest ever.
                Wherever I go I feel that he is with me, and
                always talking to me as if he were living with me.
                I cry all day long. </p>
                <p>Q: I thing that this is a natural feeling,
                because children are the dearest, and their death
                is the hardest on parents. However, the Western
                Media portraits the Palestinian as ones who do
                not care very much for the death of their
                children? A: Just imagine, those Westerners raise
                animals, treat them and even get them special
                food. And they are merely animals. How about your
                child, who has come out of your soul? How do you
                want to treat him? How will you live without him?
                How will you stand his separation away from you?
                Mohammad never stayed away from me, neither did I.
                One time I stayed away form him when I visited my
                relatives in Jordan. That was the only time I
                ever was away from him. Even when I wanted to go
                shopping , he had to come with me. When I wanted
                to visit some people and social with them, I mean
                visit women only, he used to accompany me until
                finally I told him : " You are old enough
                Mohammad." Then he told me " I like to
                come with you". This means that he is my son
                and my soul. My heart saw him before he was born.
                It is the mother's heart. I feel that my soul has
                gone with Mohammad. I wished that my soul went
                out of my body ( died) and he lived. It is the
                West's racial crime. (They think we are careless
                about our children). In your own way , you should
                make them understand this issue, because we can
                not convey this to them. </p>
                <p>Q: Despite everything, is there in this world
                any justification for a mother to sacrify her
                children, especially at this age? </p>
                <p>A: In these circumstances your children do not
                give you the chance to think. Who he goes to
                throw a rock or struggle will not give a chance
                to say anything. I said, if I could , I would not
                have let him go because he is young. But those
                young men do not give the chance. No martyr, a
                wounded person, or a person who blew himself up
                had told his family about what he was going to do.
                Neither did he give them the chance to talk to
                him about that. The issue is not whether it is
                worth it or not . We bring them up to love their
                country. We create this in them, and after that
                if you tell them not to go out participate, you
                will be teaching them how to betray, or how to
                lie. They are living for the sake of nothing, but
                their country. Unlike the rest of the world,
                their land is usurped. Maybe they can liberate it.
                They do not give you the chance to explain to
                them that they need weapons and so on and so
                forth. Every thing to them has become mere lies.
                In their point of view every thing is useless. We
                the elderly can mutually talk. We also make tens
                of attempts so that none of our children get
                wounded or die. But our children have reached to
                a point where they do not want to listen to or
                talk . They want to do what they have in mind.
                They want to try. There is no way to make them
                sit with you and comprehend, because they have
                already sat, listened and consulted. They have
                been listening to speeches about peace for the
                last fifty years, and have become impatient. It
                is impossible for any of those young men to go
                and tell his mother : " I am going to throw
                stones" or " I am going to be a martyr",
                because they know in advance that their parents
                are going to stop them. The Jewish soldier does
                not give them a chance. If they throw stones ,
                she will kill them. The Jewish soldiers justify
                this by saying he who throws a stone now will
                shoot at them some day. Killing is the Jews'
                hobby. Those soldiers know that Palestinians are
                unarmed. Your child can not understand this
                formula, but you can through your own way. You
                are old enough but he still lacks knowledge. When
                your son participates in the demonstration, he
                says he wants to do something. He says " I
                want to kill a Jew", because it is the usual
                practice that Jews kill us. Our children have
                become fed up of the Jews who have been killing,
                massacring , torturing and jailing us. Our
                children have reached a point where they do not
                appreciate speeches or thoughts. They want to do
                something . Maybe it works out. </p>
                <p>Q: You have given the greatest possible
                sacrifice. It is even greater than sacrifying
                your own soul as you have just maintained. Are
                you still ready to struggle? </p>
                <p>A: We are going on . It is a war which we do
                not want to fight by rocks only. Young men have
                to get organized , and do any thing that push
                them forward, and not pull them back. I mean this
                road is not going to be an easy one. Victory is
                not an easy mission. I hope that Mohammad and
                those martyrs' blood is not a waste. My son's
                blood as well as my other sons' , all the martyrs
                are my sons not only Mohammad, is a precious
                blood. Palestinians must do something and then
                they can reach Jerusalem. They can reach Java ,
                Haifa and Al-Abbasiyah our hometown, God willing.
                I hope that the price of that blood is not money,
                treason, negotiations and peace. Oh….. who
                will live that long? No, I hope the price is that
                we get armed and trained as soon as possible.
                After that , young men will forge on their road. </p>
                <p>Q: Could I understand that you have a feeling
                that Mohammad's blood will not be the last
                sacrifice of the Palestinian people? </p>
                <p>A: No. Of course Mohammad's blood will not be
                the last. Since 1948 and even before that our
                people have sacrificing, and God willing they
                will continue to do the same. But, God willing,
                sacrifice should have a return. I mean that in
                return for Mohammad's blood I wish to see the
                blood of one hundred Jews being shed. Also in
                return for the hundreds who got killed , hundreds
                of Jews must be killed Only then our martyrs'
                blood will cool down. Still our martyrs' blood as
                well as Mohammad's has not not cooled down. Our
                wound has heeled yet. I hope by the time our
                wound heels, our young men will have done
                something great for this country, the Palestinian
                Authority will be with the people, and the Arabs
                will have supported us. In other words, they make
                us feel that the martyrs' blood was not a waste.
                There is nothing by hour hands. We are powerless.
                We have martyrs and causalities every day. I hope
                that some day, very shortly, those young men be
                provided with arms. Weapons are going to make us
                progress somehow. If we get liberated, we will
                have killed ,scared and intimidated the Jews,
                because they are coward. They get more coward
                when they see us armed. What they care for in the
                peace process is to make us disarmed . If we get
                armed, we will do something great. I swear to God
                that I want to see a Jew get killed by the hands
                of those young men who throw rocks, in return for
                each drop of blood spilled from Mohammad. I
                really want the young men to start shooting
                bullets as soon as possible. This is my wish . </p>
                <p>Q: This is the final question. How and when
                will you feel that Mohammad's blood was a waste?
                What would make you feel so? What scares you? </p>
                <p>A: If they go back to negotiations. If they
                return to where they started, sit at one table
                and resort to negotiations. Also, if they talk
                back and forth, tarrying and thinking that the do
                us a favor, giving us from their rights not form
                ours. Then I would feel that Mohammad was a loss.
                But if they do like I have just told you: they
                give the young men arms, train them and the Jews
                are killed like they kill, then I
                …………. . If negotiators meet
                at one table, eat, drink, stay up at night and
                have fun ……………. They are
                the chiefs who control us and their sons go to
                have fun and live their life…….. then I
                would say that Mohammad's blood was a waste. If
                our chiefs did that, then stones will be directed
                to them and not to the Jews. Stones then will hit
                the Arabs. </p>
                <p>Q: This means that the greatest sacrifice one
                can make has not scared you ,or made you stop? </p>
                <p>A. No. It has not scared me. My young son went
                out to defend me, my children , his house and all
                the Arabs . He was not scared. I do not get
                frightened , but we should not keep giving
                without return. There should be a return. This
                what I want to say. If I get scared and retreated
                , this means that I do not need my country. No, I
                need our country, and we should liberate it. We
                do not want to be, unlike the rest of world,
                trodden on. If we do not want to liberate, there
                are other generations coming up. I will have my
                children get married. They will have their own
                children who should live a stable life like the
                others. Let Mohammad be one on the road of
                martyrs. Other martyrs will follow. Palestine is
                not cheap, but expensive. A lot of people will
                sacrify for its sake. I hope that they do
                something to make those young men stronger, like
                providing them with weapons. The most important
                thing is the weapons, because we are fighting the
                most powerful people in the world. We can not
                defeat them by rocks. We will make the world move
                by the stone, but it is difficult to defeat
                Israel with it. It is hard to fool our selves. If
                our neighboring Arabs helped us, and the entire
                world moved to help, that is if they really want
                peace, then they have to stand in our side,
                negotiate and give the first priority to our
                issue and resolve it. This is if they want to
                solve it peacefully. But our young men can no
                longer tolerate it if they want to make us a game
                to play forever, like the ball from one country
                to another, </p>
