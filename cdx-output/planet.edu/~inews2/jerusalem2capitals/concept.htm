<b><u><font color="#FF0000"><font size="+1">SHARING JERUSALEM "PROPOSAL"</font></font></u></b>
<br>
</p></center>

<center><p><b><font size="+2">The Concept</font></b> </p></center><font color="#6B4EB1">

<p>June 1997 will mark thirty years since the Israeli occupation and subsequent
annexation of east Jerusalem .  Tensions have rarely been greater. The expropriation
of Palestinian land continues through political and administrative procedures. Few, if any, building permits for Palestinians have been issued, house
demolition have become a regular occurrence . Palestinians mobility into
Jerusalem has been further curtailed, and identity cards of Palestinians
Jerusalemites have been systematically confiscated . Despite the official
Israeli claim of equal treatment of all Jerusalem inhabitants, there is
discrimination against Palestinians in services (including infrastructure, welfare, and education) and also in personal mobility, treatment by
authorities, and prospects for development </p>
</font><font color="000080">
<p>Since 1993 these discrepancies have been magnified as the question of
Israeli control over Jerusalem has become a key issue in Israeli domestic
politics. The rise of the Likud in the municipal elections in 1993, and
recent national elections have further exacerbated the situation. The
rise of religious extreme in the region has been particularly felt in the
city, where orthodox and secular Jews are at odds with each other and with
their Moslem and Christian neighbors, residents of the city have experienced
growing violence and unspeakable terrorism. These worrisome trends including
isolating Jerusalem from the rest of Palestinian land, alter the status
quo and make the request for a just solution to the Jerusalem issue even
more difficult. </p>
</font><font color="000040">
<p>The next year will be critical for the future of the city and for the
prospect for a full and comprehensive peace. Negotiations over the permanent
settlement between Israel and the P. L. O.,with Jerusalem as key stumbling
block, are due to begin. Its now abundantly clear that the future of
the Jerusalem is central to the entire peace process. Without investing
in finding a way to live together in Jerusalem, there will be no enduring
peace in the region. </p>
</font><font color="ff0000">
<p>The ground work for dialogue in this most critical of endeavors is dismally
absent. Very little contact exists between Israeli and Palestinians within
the city.  Official statements have only fueled mutual suspision and acrimony. Discussion on the future of the city has been perceived as threatening
to both sides, and the willingness to explore constructive means of coexisting
in the city has diminished . Even the most minimal conditions for a different, positive discourse on Jerusalem are sorely lacking. </p>
</font><font color="#6B4EB1">
<p>It is necessary to begin to revere these trends immediately, or the
prospects for a viable solution will dwindle irretrievably. Despite the
existence of academic attempts to explore alternatives for negotiating
the Jerusalem question, in the absence of official gestures in this sphere, practical initiatives must be taken by citizens of the city committed
to a fair and just solution for both Palestinians and Israelis. Without
dividing the city, it is possible to find ways of sharing Jerusalem and
recognizing it as containing two capitals for two sovereign states . Jerusalem, the focus of discord, can itself be transformed into living proof on 
the human capacity for reconciliation and peace. </p>
</font>
<p>The first steps in meeting the challenges inherent is sharing Jerusalem
 require the opening of channels of communication, discussion, and interaction which highlight
the themes of diversity and mutual respect. It is vital that the multiple
meaning associated with Jerusalem can be discussed, and that the essential
pluralism of the city be maintained through advancing viable models of
coexistence. In order to achieve these objects it is necessary to demonstrate
modes of cooperation based on the principles of mutual respect. </p>
<p><font color="14abc7"></font></p><p><font color="14abc7"><b><font color="ff0000">The  Jerusalem Link : A women's Joint Venture for Peace </font></b><i><b>, provides precisely such a model . The Jerusalem Link is a coordinating body of two independent women's centers : Bat Shalom – The Jerusalem  Women's Action  Center located  in West Jerusalem  . The Jerusalem Link serves as a base  for coordination , cooperation, and mutual support  for Israeli and Palestinian women, while each center maintains its organizational  and executive integrity . 
      The Link was founded in the belief that independent, equal  and interactive institutions can embody the vision of a just and  fruitful peace between the Israelis and Palestinians, while giving concrete expression to the principles of mutual respect for national  and human rights, reciprocity, equality and coexistence.
</b></i></font></p><font color="14abc7"><i><b>
</b></i></font>

<font color="#6B4EB1"><p><b><font color="ff0000">The Jerusalem Link</font></b><i><b> experience, successfully elaborated and refined
over the past three years, can serve as a living model for negotiating
the future of Jerusalem like the Link, Jerusalem itself can be a city of
good neighborly relations and at the same time, a city where Israelis
and Palestinians exercise their independent national rights. The proposed
project, Sharing Jerusalem, is another - and - major - step forward in
the activities of the Jerusalem Link, which have included a series of
symposia, meetings, leadership training seminars, rallies, demonstrations
and press conferences organized to promote its principles. By initiating
this project, the Jerusalem Link seeks to bring the concept that underlies
the organization to bear on the real problems of the city and the conflict
it has come to embody . </b></i></p><i><b>
</b></i></font>
<p>The project involves three distinct phase . The first planning phase, calls for the establishment of a local organizing committee to work together
in the preparation and production of a set of multi- media events. The
second implementation phase will take place in Jerusalem in a series of
public events, each will constitute a different manifestation of the possibilities
of coexistence in the city. The third phase will be devoted to follow-
up and continuity, to the formation of going frameworks for joint action
in a variety of spheres. Throughout, equal emphasizes will be placed
on the process of opening avenues of working together on the activities
themselves. </p>
<font color="#6B4EB1">
</font><p><font color="#6B4EB1">The application of the Jerusalem Link model to the knotty question of
sharing Jerusalem highlights the contribution that women have made to achieving
peace between Palestinians and Israelis. Women in the region have consistently
been pioneer in showing that this debilitating conflict can be solved in
non- violent ways. Although initiated and directed by women, Sharing
Jerusalem is designed for all the residents of the city and will incorporate
both men and women in all stages of preparation and implementation and
because the future of Jerusalem is not only the concern of Israelis and
Palestinians, but of many people in the international community, the
planned events are also envisioned as a demonstration of solidarity of
artists, academics, politicians, performers and clerics who believe in
peaceful coexistence and in the feminist vision that negotiations based
on the recognition of the rights and needs of the other are eventually
beneficial to all. </font></p>
