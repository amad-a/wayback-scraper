<center><p><b>Conflict Resolution and the 
Question of Jerusalem.</b> </p></center>

<b><i><font color="#008040">

First of all let us give you brief information about the center we represent. The Jerusalem Center for Women is a Palestinian non-governmental women’s organization which seeks to activate and advance Palestinian women’s issues. It aims to establish a women’s network of local, regional and international organizations on the basis of parity, reciprocity and mutual respect of human rights and basic freedoms.</font></i></b><p><font color="#008040">
</font><font color="#6B4EB1"><b>
The Center is part of a Palestinian-Israeli joint venture called the "Jerusalem Link". The Israeli Counter part is Bat Shalom. The link was established after productive dialogue between prominent Palestinian and Israeli women politicians and activists took place for years. They reached an agreement on basic principals to work accordingly while initiating and implementing projects with relation to the resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli  conflict. The agreed upon principals guarantee  the right of the Palestinian people to self determination and sovereignty along side Israel, and the rights of all peoples in the region to live in dignity and security. The basis of a two state solution and Jerusalem as two capitals  for two states has been agreed upon as the means for this one hundred years old conflict resolution.</b></font></p><p>
<b>
Depending on, the project of "Sharing Jerusalem: Two Capitals for two states" came to life. Women who lived in a confrontational atmosphere,  realized why the Intifada was broken  came together to demonstrate against Israeli occupation violation of the cultural rights of the Palestinian people in their home city. </b></p><p><b>

We believe, only, when the scenario of two capitals for two states is accepted and implemented, reconciliation  and peaceful coexistence can be achieved. Jerusalem then will be the universal spiritual capital for the followers of the three monotheistic religions and all peace believers and seekers.</b></p><p><b>
<font color="#6B4EB1">
Sharing Jerusalem : Two Capitals for Two States is our equation to resolve one of the main problematic issues in the Arab - Israeli conflict. It is a win - win equation not a zero - sum one, like that of the Israeli governments , the Judization policy.</font></b></p><p><b><font color="#6B4EB1">
</font>
We Believe peace can’t be achieved unless we try to break the stereotype    of the enemy, humanize the enemy and attack the oppressive system not the people.</b></p><p><b>

The confidence building measures include having open channels for dialogue by which one gets to know the other, try to  find common grounds for working together. But we should keep in mind that joint work is a step forward that will never be enough unless the political  establishment stop its harassment measures such as in our case: land confiscation, colonies building, I. D. Confiscation and denial of the national political rights of the Palestinian Jerusalemites.</b></p><p><b>
<font color="#6B4EB1">
The Palestinian Jerusalemites are not considered citizens in their own city, but rather foreigners who live in Israel. Palestinian who marry those who do not have Jerusalem’s I.d. can’t live in Jerusalem because their wives or husband can’t get permits to live or even enter Jerusalem. Consequently, they lose their right of holding the Jerusalem’s I.d. because their center of live become outside the borders specified by Israel after 1967 war. It is worth noting also that the holy city has been under continuous  closure for the last six years; and for the last two years, West Bankers can’t even apply to get a permit to enter it unless there is an urgent need. Through this political policy the Israeli establishment is trying to create another fact on the ground by which  Jerusalem does not any more stand as the center of Palestinians political, cultural, religious, economic life.</font></b></p><p><b>

However, we the seekers of peace who are at the same time the weaker on the balance of power have chosen a long term strategy where we are ready to tackle the simple matters first and then deal with the complex ones having in mind a clear vision while moving ahead in the quest to achieve our goals; of course, while rejecting any unilateral action that violates the rights of the other. </b></p><p><b>

Palestinians who owned about 70% of West Jerusalem’s property on the eve of 1948 War, by which 45,000 persons were expelled from their houses; and those who since 1967 lost 40% of East Jerusalem’s land for Jewish colonies building do not give up their rights, but they are ready to negotiate so that peace can be achieved.</b></p><p><b>
<font color="#008040">
We have no choice but to work together; Muslims, Christians and Jews restore justice while deciding the final status of the holy city. Since Jerusalem is not important only to the Palestinians and Israelis, the international world’s support is critically essential. We need clear political stands from the Mediterranean countries on governmental and non-governmental levels and especially by women groups and institutions whereby they lobby with us against all forms of state violence and terrorism.
 </font><font color="#008040">
Dear Fellow women, the doorway to peace is Jerusalem. Lets work together  to end the Israeli occupation for Jerusalem and lets find  a mechanism to share it .
