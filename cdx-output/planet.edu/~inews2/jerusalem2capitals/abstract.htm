WOMEN’S JOINT VENTURE FOR PEACE</font></font></b><font size="+1">

<font color="#6B4EB1">
<p>The future of Jerusalem is at the core of the Palestinian - Israeli
peace process. Jerusalem ( <font color="#FF0000">
Al- Quds in Arabic, Yerushalyim in Hebrew</font> ) is basic to the self- identity and needs
of each side to the conflict . Jerusalem has become the most emotion- laden
and seemingly intractable core element of the already extremely complicated
process begun three years ago with the singing of the Oslo Declaration
of Principles on 13 September , 1993 . </p>

<p>Multiple political, religions, cultural and emotional constrains in
both the Israeli and Palestinians communities have hampered efforts at
rational discussions on the future of Jerusalem and precluded interaction
among the divers segments of the city's population . Yet without communication
on this most sensitive of issue , it will be virtually impossible to present
and explore alternative options for coexistence and resolution . </p>

<p>This is a proposal for enhancing cooperation among the varied sectors
of the city , initiated by The Jerusalem Link , a Palestinian - Israeli
women's joint venture for peace established in 1994 . A week - long series
of cultural , political , religious and social events is planned for June
1997 in both parts of the city under the theme " <font color="#FF0000">Sharing
Jerusalem :  Two Capitals for Two States</font> "
. The planning , production , implementation and follow - up of this project
will be conducted on cooperative basis . </p>

<p>The purpose of the broadest week of the events is to mobilize concerned
Israelis and Palestinians and draw the attention of the domestic and international
community to the urgency of addressing the future of Jerusalem in a way
which recognizing the political and human rights of the residents of the
city. Such as an approach establishes the conditions in which Palestinians
and Israelis, Moslems, Jews and Christians, may live in peace in this
city, which has a cultural, religious, economic, political and symbolic
importance for its residents . </p>
</font>
<p>This project is rooted in the understandings agreed upon by the board
of Jerusalem Link and ensconced <font color="#FF0000"><b>The Jerusalem Link
Declaration .</b></font> </p>

<ul>
<p><i><font color="#008000"><b>We, Palestinian and Israeli women, united
in a joint effort to bring about a just and lasting peace between our two
people, affirm our communicate to working together, within the framework
of the Jerusalem Link, for the rapid resolution common vision of peace, based on the following principals : </b></font></i></p><ol>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b></b></font></p><li><font color="#FF0000"> recognition of the right to self- determination
of both peoples in the land, through the creation of the Palestine State
alongside Israel. </font><p></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b></b></font></p></li><li><font color="#FF0000"> The city of Jerusalem : Two capitals
for two states .</font><p></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b></b></font></p></li><li><font color="#FF0000"> The Oslo Declaration of Principals,
signed on September 13/1993, and all subsequent agreements, must be
implemented in their entirety and should serve as the basis for negotiations
of the permanent settlement . </font><p></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b></b></font></p></li><li><font color="#FF0000">The permanent settlement negotiations
must resume immediately, the terms of reference being UN resolutions,
242 and 338 and the Oslo agreements . </font><p></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b></b></font></p></li><li><font color="#FF0000"> The settlements and their ongoing expansion
constitute a several impediment to peace </font><p></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b></b></font></p></li><li><font color="#FF0000"> Respect for international conventions
,and the active involvement of the international community in the peace
process is crucial to its success. </font><p></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b></b></font></p></li><li><font color="#FF0000"> The realization of political peace will
pave the way for mutual trust and good neighborly relations on the basis
of equality and respect for the national and for human rights of each community
. </font><p></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b></b></font></p></li><li><font color="#FF0000"> Women are central partners in the peace
process - their involvement in negotiation and in government is critical
to the fulfillment of an open and just peace . </font><p></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b></b></font></p></li><li><font color="#FF0000"> We women are opposed to the use of
violence and are committed to the promotion of democratic norms and civil
society for the realization of an enduring peace . </font><p></p></li></ol>

<p><b><font color="#008000">We call on women and men in the region and elsewhere
to join  us in making our vision of peace and reality . </font></b></p>

<p>The amount requested for this project is $ 1,001,500 for a period of
one year commencing on 1st of January 1997. Proceeds of income from some of
the events will be used to create a fund for ongoing activities and at
maintaining communication between Israelis and Palestinians in the city
,and achieving a just solution to the Jerusalem conundrum based on equality
and mutual respect . <br></p><p>
