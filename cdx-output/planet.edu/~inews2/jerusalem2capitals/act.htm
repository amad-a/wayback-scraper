</font><p><font color="#008000"><b>The Sharing Jerusalem project, with its emphasis on finding non-
conflictual ways of living together in Jerusalem on the basis of equality
and justice, is concerned both with the product of organizing a week -
long series of events and with the process of developing a pattern of working
together across traditional lines of conflict .</b></font><b> </b></p><font color="#6B4EB1">


<p><b><font color="#FF0000">The Product</font></b> </p>

<p>A variety of activities are planned for the last week of June, 1997, involving dozens f Israelis, Palestinians, artists, performers, scholars,
politicians and clerics, at sites located throughout the city . Some of
these activities will be designed jointly and others will be organized
separately according to the needs of each community . The purpose of these
activities is to highlight the geographic, religious, political, cultural, ethnic and political diversity of the city, as well, the prospects for
cooperation inherent in this heterogeneous mosaic. The participation of
varied sectors of the city's population together with a diverse group of
performers and visitors, is in itself a powerful political statement intended to show that it is possible to  existing
psychological and physical barriers in the city .</p>

<ul>
<li><b><font color="#FF0000">The Culture of Jerusalem</font></b> A set
of multi-media events is envisaged . In the performing arts, these include
music, dance theater, film and video. In the visual arts, several art
exhibitions are anticipated, as well as plastic arts and crafts workshop,
In the creative arts, poetry reading and writing workshop and symposia
are planned, All the cultural activities will be accompanied by discussions
to maximize the amount of interaction among the participants .</li>

<li><b><font color="#FF0000">The Geography of Jerusalem</font></b> Alternative
tours of Jerusalem will be conducted during the course of the week . These
tours will be target institutions, religious places, neighborhoods, outlying
settlements and an overview of services in both sides of the city . Special
efforts will be made to highlight the personal aspects of daily life in
the different parts of the city from both Palestinian and Israeli perspectives.</li>

<li><b><font color="#FF0000">The spirit of Jerusalem </font></b>The week
of Sharing Jerusalem will be also include a limited number of symposia, lectures and academic workshops devoted to the history, culture and religion
of the city a well as the status of human rights and social welfare . Bringing
together leading local and international scholars and activist. These
small gathering will enable an exchange of views on a variety of salient
topics discussed in each community, but rarely debated across national
and religious frontiers . Within this context, particular emphasizes will
be placed on exploring proven modes of reconciliation, especially in the
area of religion and evaluating their applicability for conflict resolution
in the framework of Jerusalem . </li>

<li><b><font color="#FF0000">The Politics of Jerusalem </font></b>Building
on the momentum engendered by the various activities, the week will culminate
in a political conference which will examine alternative scenarios for
the future of Jerusalem and will recommend concrete mechanism for increasing
coexistence in the city, and in women's march for peace, drawing on the
example of the successful women's rally organized in Jerusalem in December
1990, as part of the " Hands around Jerusalem " demonstration
. A framework for the continuation of cooperative activities will then
be created. </li>
</ul>


<p><b><font color="#008000">To encourage participants in the week-long
set activities , tickets will be sold to one or several events and a subscription
will be offered for the entire week . Furthermore, a catalogue of the
events will be produced profiling the geographic, cultural, political
and academic facets of the program, a well as the vision underlying the
project . The catalogue will be then used to create a fund to encourage
future activities based on the concept of sharing Jerusalem . </font></b></p>


<p><b><font color="#FF0000">The Process </font></b></p>

<p>The multi-faceted program of events necessities extensive cooperation
between Israelis and Palestinians, bolstered by substantial international
backing. Given the technical and political complexities inherent in this
undertaking, the process of production itself becomes an integral part
of the project . The stages of preparation implementation and follow-up
are therefore viewed a an intensive experience in themselves, designed to
foster joint work and enhance bonding . </p>

<ul>
<li><b><font color="#FF0000">Coordination.</font></b> The decision to undertake
this project was made jointly by the Israelis and Palestinian centers of
 the Jerusalem Link . The concept was elaborated together in a series of meetings
and this proposal was prepared collaboratively. The core Jerusalem Link
committee will continue to oversee the project . It has established a joint
steering committee by agreement, which will recruit additional organizations
as sponsors on each side, mobilize volunteers, help set-up professional
sub-committees for each central theme, liaise with international organizations
and decide on the hiring of the Palestinian and Israeli producers. </li>

<li><b><font color="#FF0000">Interaction.</font></b> Some joint activities
will take place during the course of 1997 to facilitate the preparation
of the June events and to enhance communication . Starting in January 1997, a monthly event will take place to build up momentum for the June week
and to further increase commitment and joint action . Moreover, all technical
aspects of the preparations such as contacts with officials, requests
for permit, location of sites, planning of tours, agreement on performers
and publicity will be handled by joint teams . Finally, supervision of
the ongoing projects will be administrated by a standing committee .</li>
</ul>


<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>This project, then, constitutes an experiment
in managing interaction in the politically-charged atmosphere of contemporary
Jerusalem. The ability to maintain good working relations and to carry
out the program can become a real demonstration of the prospects for peaceful
coexistence in the city. </b></font></p>
