      </p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2" color="#000000">The 
        Palestinian people are going through a difficult period on the political, 
        economical, and social level.. This is due to the complexity of the political 
        situation and the invasion of the market economy ethics and globalization.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2" color="#000000">
      These new characteristics of the Palestinian Society have become to threaten 
      the requirements of the social security and the values of social justice, 
      equality, and solidarity. This accelerates the process of class separation 
      toward a greater marginalization even to the middle classes.
      </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2" color="#000000">
      The Palestinian Working Women Society-PWWS- through its intimate &amp; direct 
      link with grassroots women in villages, camps, cities, and its role as a 
      societal organization has adopted the 'Series of Solidarity &amp; Compassion' 
      project. The idea is to revive the notion of cooperation and a societal 
      participation based on solidarity among all society sectors. This is done 
      by rebuilding the bridges in the Palestinian society classes in stressing 
      the dependence on locale resources instead of foreign aid.

        the following aims:</font></font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2" color="#000000">
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2" color="#000000">To consolidate 
          the notion of give and take principle and the exchange and the cooperation

          especially in the realm of female education; 
        </font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2" color="#000000">Building a self-supportive societal system that relies on locale human and material 
          resources as an alternative to foreign aid;
        </font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2" color="#000000">This initiative is a modest attempt to confront abusive policies and the impoverishment 
          of the Palestinian People. The imposing of an economic and social reality 
          would loosen the values and the positive social norms in exchange of 
          selfish values and abuse. </font>

          or moral. In exchange the beneficiary concerned offers, in turn, another 
          form of help to others in the form of social service within his/her 
          possibility.
        </font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2" color="#000000">Solidarity in the exchange of material items: This form of solidarity is based

          them. the items are in condition- The PWWS, through its contacts, is
