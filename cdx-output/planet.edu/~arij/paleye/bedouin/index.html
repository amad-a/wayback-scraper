The Bedouin tribes are an important part of the Palestinian heritage
 as they have roamed Palestine for thousands of years (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/paleye/bedouin/fig1.jpg">Figure
 1</a>). Today, the
 Bedouin way of life is under threat of extinction as a result
 of the constant harassment of the Israeli government .  Since the
 Israeli occupation of the West Bank in 1967, the Bedouins have
 been subjected to numerous attempts to drive them out of their
 land.  In recent years, the Bedouins have been under attack by
 the Israeli military in an attempt to carry out the development
 of West Bank colonies and to expropriate vast amounts of Bedouin
 land prior to the final status talks with the Palestinian Authority.

 These areas are rich in natural resources, such as water and grazing
 land, as well as many caves which have served as Bedouin shelters
 for millennia.  This land has also been reasonably far from human
 civilization until recently.  Traditionally, the Bedouin tribes
 have led a nomadic life, moving to the hills in early April and
 back down to the valleys in early September to escape the weather (for more detail
 <a href="/planet.edu/paleye/beitdajn/history.htm">Cilck here</a>).
 Proximity to civilization severely limits their capacity to roam
 freely and graze sheep and cattle, their main means of living.

 The establishment of Israeli colonies in the Jordan Valley initiated
 the confrontation between Israel and the Bedouin people (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/paleye/bedouin/fig3.jpg">Figure
 3</a>).  The reasoning
 behind the Israeli policy
 of colonization of the Jordan Valley is two-fold.  Firstly, the
 Israeli government wishes to establish a buffer zone between the
 Palestinian people and the Green Line boundary of the West Bank
 along the Jordan River.  This would serve to totally fragment
 Palestinians from Jordan, the current home of most of the Palestinian
 Diaspora.  Secondly, the rich resource base of the Jordan Valley
 is very attractive to Israel.  Water resources, mineral extraction
 from the Dead Sea, and tourism in the area currently provide a
 substantial revenue to the Israeli government.  <br>

<p align="CENTER"><b>Figure 3</b>:
 Satellite image of Bedouins in the Jordan Valley showing neighboring Israeli 
 colony</p>
<p align="justify">
 In order to facilitate this colonization process, the Israeli
 government has employed a number of forms of physical and economic
 harassment against the Bedouins.  The most publicized case has
 been the removal and relocation of the Jahalin Bedouins from their
 homes in the Jordan Valley to an area adjacent the Jerusalem dumping
 grounds in Abu Dies (For more detail <a href="/planet.edu/paleye/maale/index.htm">Click here</a>).
 Similar
 cases of forced removal of Bedouin families by the Israeli military
 have also been reported (see Chronology of Recent Events below).
 Meanwhile, the price of fodder has doubled in recent years to
 US$ 210 per ton, while sheep and goat meat prices have decreased
 substantially.  <br>
 </p>
<p align="justify">
 Over the years, the various occupying powers who have held the
 Palestinian land captive have passed several laws to control the
 land from its aboriginal owners in order to exploit their natural
 resources.  Two laws in particular have been dominant in their
 sum and substance regardless of the identity of the occupying
 power.  These are:<br>
 </p>
<ol>
 <li>The occupying power identifies itself as the official owner
  of the land it has subjugated.
  </li>
 <li>Possession of the land is confined by its usage.
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">
 Through application of these laws, the occupying powers have been
 able to expropriate enormous amounts of land from the Palestinians
 . The Bedouins have experienced
 tremendous losses due to these laws as the majority of their land
 is employed for cattle and sheep grazing, which does not classify
 as land usage.  <br>
 </p>
<p align="justify">
 Since 1997, the Bedouins have been subjected to greater pressure
 to evacuate their land, and many have already been dislodged from
 their lands and homes.  Although these Bedouins have presented
 solid proof of ownership that date back many years before the
 1967 occupation, they have very little chance of winning an injunction
 in the Israeli courts to stop these actions.  Jahalin Bedouins,
 among others, were exceptionally targeted during 1997.  They have
 gone through several rounds with the Israeli Army struggling to
 defend their land.  <br>

 <b>Froush Biet Dajan as a case study

 Froush Biet Dajan Bedouins became refugees after the Israeli occupation
 of Palestine in 1948.  On 4 March 1997, the residents of Froush
 Biet Dajan in the Jordan Valley received a military order to once
 again transfer out of the land they had settled and built their
 lives around(<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/paleye/bedouin/fig4.gif">Figure 4</a>).</p>

<p align="CENTER"><b>Figure 4</b>: Location map Of Fruosh Beit Dajan</p>
<p align="justify">  More than 5,000 Palestinians have moved to Froush
 Beit Dajan on the lands of Tammoun village since 1952, after being
 driven by the Israeli army from their original land in Al Samo'
 village.  This new eviction was forced upon them in order to accomodate
 the expansion of the Jewish colonies of Beqa'ot and Hamra.  This
 colony expansion is occurring despite the fact that they currently
 house half the number of inhabitants originally planned for the
 settlements.  <br>
 </p>
<p align="justify">
 Beqa'ot<b> </b>colony was founded in 1972 over the land of the
 Palestinian village Tammoun. Spread over 675 dunums, the colony
 was established in the Jordan Valley to hold a total number of
 80 families.  Currently, the total number of families in the colony
 reaches around 35 with a population about 150 colonist.<br>
 </p>
<p align="justify">
 Hamra colony was established in 1971 after confiscating 690 dunums
 from the Palestinian village Beit Dajan.  Today this colony holds
 130 colonist from 35 families.  The original town was planned
 for a capacity of 80 families.<br>
 </p>
<p align="justify">
 The area at risk is a range land used for grazing more than 100,000
 sheep (with an estimated value of US$ 15 million) and cultivated
 with fruit trees.  The dairy products of these sheep are their
 only means of living.  The area is already surrounded with Israeli
 military camps, and the Bedouin families are continuously subjected
 to harassment by the Israeli army and colonists.  This is an example
 of the falsehood of the common Israeli excuse of settlement expansion
 due to natural population growth as a reason for the confiscation
 of Palestinian land.  <br>

 any guarantees of financial compensation or grazing land areas

 The Da'is extended Bedouin family in the Jiftlik area of the Jordan
 valley witnessed a massive raid by the Israeli army and the semi-military
 Israeli border guards who went on a rampage of destruction. They
 demolished the Bedouins' tents and confiscated them, as well as
 the inhabitants' meager belongings; ruined the cattle-pen and
 confiscated the goats; confiscated also the Bedouins single truck;
 and to cap it all, destroyed the water tank and spilled its contents
 into the sands. Sixty people- men, women, and children- were left
 under the open sky, with literally nothing left to them<br>

 The Israeli policy of eviction and relocation of the Palestinian
 Bedouins is destroying their way of life.  The Bedouin eviction
 process is merely one of the many detrimental and destructive

 of an ethnic cleansing campaign within Palestinian land by the
 State of Israel (For more detail <a href="/planet.edu/paleye/ethnic/index.htm">Click here</a>).
