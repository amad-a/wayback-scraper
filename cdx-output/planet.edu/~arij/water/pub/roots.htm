<h2><a name="as-h2-63422">Introduction
 </a></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Water has historically played a significant role in shaping the
 geopolitical boundaries of the Middle East.  
 Few realize that the lines on present day
 maps of the region are, to a great extent, the result of a continuous
 parade
 of water related wars, occupations, cease-fires and imposed peace
 plans.
 Today's boundaries in the Middle East are, primarily, artificial
 frontiers
 imposed within the past 75 years by distant foreign powers. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Water considerations continue to
 inhibit regional cooperation and
 agreement.  To a large degree, water resources in the area have been taken
 over by force and military action.
 Accordingly, the interrelationship
 between water resources, conflict,
 competing ideologies, nationalistic
 agendas and basic human needs cannot
 be overlooked.  Unless, this
 complex interplay is taken into
 consideration during future plans, water
 issues will guide the peoples
 of the Middle East into further conflict.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Past attempts at solving water
 disputes have, for the most part, failed.
 Previous solutions were too often based
 on political objectives, securing the
 emergence of the State of Israel
 and ensuring adequate resources for its
 projected growth.  The need for a more
 satisfactory plan is beyond dispute.
 Such a plan must account fairly
 for the needs of the region's neighbor
 states.  To do so, an exploration of
 the the contexts of previously proposed
 solutions is enlightening.  Previous
 mistakes are revealed and a new path
 forward begins to emerge.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="as-h2-63423">Background</a></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Geographical Palestine has a rich history
 of agricultural productivity.  Soils
 and climatic patterns range widely within
 a blockquote area, from fertile plains
 and hills to stark deserts. 
 That which is tillable depends on seasonal
 rainwater, or, if irrigated, upon
 water from subsoil aquifers or surface
 sources.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Most of the surface waters in Palestine
 lie in the northern and
 north-eastern regions, with the headwaters
 of the Jordan River System lying
 in Lebanon and Syria.  The Southern
 parts of the country, particulary the
 Negev area, have been left dry.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 To establish a Jewish State in Palestine,
 it was deemed necessary to bring
 together large numbers of immigrants
 and provide good land for
 cultivation, industry and living. Palestine,
 as it was then, did not have the
 resources to absorb the millions
 of Jews brought to fulfill this Zionist
 dream.  Thus, the Zionist Movement began
 studying ways of developing
 the natural resources of Palestine to
 enable the absorption of large numbers
 of Jewish immigrants.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Much of the initial research and data collection was conducted by the
 British Royal Society and the Zionist Movement, with the aim of assessing
 Palestine's natural resource potential. The studies carried out mainly
 concentrated on the area. Charles Warren, in 1875, estimated, in 
 <i>The Land of Promise</i> that Palestine
 and the Negev could easily absorb 15 million people.  
 From this point on, efforts
 towards gaining control of the waters of Palestine received top priority.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 At the same time that Jews were aunching a political campaign to
 establish a new home in Palestine, they were also formulating plans to
 utilize the area's water resources. After the declaration of the British
 Mandate in 1922, the Jewish Agency formed a special technical committee
 to conduct studies on the utilization of water and irrigation of unarable and
 desert land.  This committee performed several studies, with the assistance
 and cooperation of Jewish and pro-Jewish experts and governments, in
 particular the British Mandate Government. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Concurrently, to serve as a guide to future political resolutions in the area,
 the British Mandate Government carried out studies on water issues in
 Palestine and East Jordan Valley.  Most of the studies conducted were used
 to evaluate both water plans designed by the Jewish Agency and also the
 United Nation Partition Plan of Palestine. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Arab inhabitants of the area, who opposed previous water plans, found
 it imperative to protect their water resources and thus, began designing
 their own plans. Arab water plans necessarily contradicted the objectives of
 others.  Whereas, these water plans posed a direct threat to Arab rights in
 the area, Jewish demand for water was increasing, to essentially facilitate
 the absorption of new immigrants.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Rising political tension in the region and the lack of a solution acceptable
 to all parties, exacerbated and eventually exploded into several rounds of
 water wars between Arabs and Jews.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="as-h2-63424">Previous Plans And Events</a></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The following pages summarize the main water plans and events which
 have taken place since 1922.  Although, many important events preceeded
 the British Mandate and contributed vastly to the ideologocial underpinnigs
 which supported later plans, post-1922 plans were critical in shaping today's
 water crisis.  Two important water-related events highlight the British
 Mandate of Palestine, 1922 - 1948: the <i>Rutenberg Concession</i>
 and the <i>Ionides Plan</i>.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In 1926, the British High Commissioner granted the Jewish owned Palestine
 Electricity Corporation, founded by Pinhas Rutenberg, a 70 year concession
 to utilize the Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers' water for generating electricity.
 The concession denied Arab farmers the right to use the Yarmouk and
 Jordan Rivers' water upstream of their junction for any reason, unless
 permission was granted from the Palestine Electricity Corporation.
 Permission was never granted.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In 1937, the government of Great Britain assigned M. Ionides, a
 hydrologist, to serve as the Director of Development for the East Jordan
 Government.  His actual task was solely to conduct a study on the water
 resources and irrigation potentials of the Jordan Valley Basin.  This study
 served as a main reference in the preparation of the proposed United
 Nations Partition Plan of Palestine.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Published in 1939, the <i>Ionides Plan</i> made three recommendations.
 Firstly, Yarmouk flood waters were to be stored in Lake Tiberias.
 Secondly, the stored waters in Lake Tiberias plus a blockquote quantity (1.76
 cm/sec) of the Yarmouk River water, diverted through the East Ghor
 canal, were to be used to irrigate 75,000 acres (300,000 dunums) of land
 east of the Jordan River.  And finally, the secured irrigation water of the
 Jordan River System, estimated at a potential of 742 mcm, were to be used
 primarily within the Jordan Valley Basin. 
 <i>[<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/water/pub/#r7">Ionides p. 8, 255-259</a>]</i>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Since the Jordan and the Yarmouk Rivers were at that time still under the
 authority of the Palestine Electricity Corporation, the plan was difficult to
 implement.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Zionist supporters worldwide were not satisfied with the findings and
 recommendations of Ionides.  Their aspiration
 to utilize the Jordan River Basin for the irrigation of the
 Negev and the southern parts of Palestine
 was fulfilled by<i> walterclay Lowdermilk </i>. Lowdermilk was commissioned
 by the United States Department of Agriculture
 to conduct such a study. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Lowdermilk devised a plan calling for the irrigation of the Jordan Valley;
 the diversion of the Jordan and Yarmouk
 rivers to create hydroelectric
 power; the diversion of water from northern
 Palestine to the Negev desert
 in the south; and the usage of the Litani
 River in Lebanon. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In striking contrast to the Ionides
 plan, Lowdermilk concluded that 1800
 mcm of water is available in the Jordan
 Basin for the purpose of irrigation.
 A canal was recommended to connect
 the Mediterranean Sea with the
 Dead Sea.  Also, an authority similar
 to the Tennessee Valley Authority
 should be formed to assume full control
 over all activities concerning water
 resources.  Such water management would
 ideally ensure adequate water
 resources and job opportunities for 4 million
 new Jewish immigrants in
 addition to the 1.8 million Arabs
 already living in Palestine and East
 Jordan at that time. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Control over the proposed project
 should be solely in the hands of Jews,
 with a limited amount of input
 allotted to the United Nations.  Arabs
 unable or unwilling to live under such
 conditions were to be transferred to
 areas near the Euphrates and
 the Tigris Valleys. 
 <i>[<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/water/pub/#r7">Lowdermilk p. 169</a>]</i>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Lowdermilk's plan and suggestions
 were enthusiastically embraced by
 influential Zionists. Technical experts
 subsequently contracted to
 Iimplement and interpret this plan into
 feasible schemes.  James B. Hays
 was selected for this assignment.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The<i> Hays Plan</i> of 1948
 called for half of the Yarmouk River water to be
 diverted into Lake Tiberias, replacing
 water diverted from the upper
 Jordan River, as outlined in the
 Lowdermilk plan from which Hays
 worked.  Two additional stages were
 suggested to be implemented in the
 future, although not stated, they most
 likely included the diversion of the
 Litani River water into geographical
 Palestine in order to be used for
 Israeli projects. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 As a continuation of the Lowdermilk-Hays
 Plan, the new government of
 Israel, soon after the War of 1948,
 began to prepare practical plans for the
 utilization and control of the area's
 water resources.  A <i>Seven Year Plan</i>
 Happroved publicly in 1953, centered around
 the diversion of the Jordan
 River water south toward the Negev desert
 and establishing a unified and
 comprehensive water network that
 would cover all parts of Israel.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In September 1953, the construction
 of the <i>National Water Carrier</i> began
 and thus plans to divert the Jordan
 River water, south to the Negev, were
 activated.  Diversion originated
 at the Banat Yacoub Bridge in the
 demilitarized zone between Israel and
 Syria.  After Syrian objection to the
 excavation process, and United States'
 economic sanctions against Israel, a
 temporary freeze on the work at Banat
 Yacoub Bridge was announced in
 October 1953.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 During the 1948 war, the Rutenberg
 electricity generating plant was
 destroyed by the Jewish army
 in an attempt to avoid exclusive Arab
 control over the use of the Jordan and
 Yarmouk Rivers.  The war forced a
 great number of Palestinian refugees
 to flee and settle in the eastern part
 of the Jordan Valley.  The Jordanian
 Government and UNRWA (The
 United Nations Relief and Works Agency) agreed
 to develop irrigation
 schemes in the area to assist Palestinian
 refugees to cultivate the land and
 resettle.  For this purpose,
 the Jordanian Government commissioned a
 British consultant, Sir Murdoch
 MacDonald, to conduct a study on their
 behalf.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The 
 <i>MacDonald Plan</i> was finalized in 1951.  It is considered
 a compliment
 to the Ionides Plan.  The plan
 called for Jordan Basin water to be
 exclusively used for irrigation of both
 banks of the Jordan River by storing
 surplus water from the Yarmouk River
 in Lake Tiberias and constructing
 canals down both sides of the Valley.
 Arabs were uneasy with the
 suggestion of the storage of water
 in Lake Tiberias, as they were in
 previous plans.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Therefore, Arabs favored the plan put
 forth by the American engineer<i> M. E. Bunger</i>
 a suitable location for the construction of a
 water storage dam along the Yarmouk
 River at the Moqarin area, where
 three valleys join together. The impounded
 water would be diverted to
 another dam at Addassiyah into gravity
 flow canals along the East Ghore
 area in the Jordan Valley.  The plan
 included two hydroelectric generating
 plants at the site of the two dams to
 supply water and electricity to both
 Jordan and Syria. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Bunger Plan addressed several
 of Jordan and Syria's needs and
 Iintended to resolve, to some extent,
 the Palestinian refugee problem by
 Iincreasing the productivity of
 available agricultural lands in the East
 Jordan Valley and parts of Syria.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 As soon as work began in July 1953,
 Israel vocalized its concern about
 increasing Arab control over the area's
 water resources.  Israel objected on
 the grounds that the original Rutenberg
 Concession gave it exclusive rights
 to the Yarmouk River.  As a result,
 pressure was exerted on the United
 States Government and UNRWA to cease
 support for the project. To the
 surprise of the Jordanian Government,
 work halted soon thereafter and the
 project was terminated.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In October 1953, the United States
 prepared the <i>Johnston Plan</i> as yet another
 attempt to solve the area's water crisis.
 The rising tension caused by the
 Israeli initiation of the National
 Water Carrier project, encouraged the
 United States to mediate between
 the two parties.  The plan sought to
 satisfy the minimum requirements of
 riparian Arab states, as well as Israel.
 Eric Johnston implemented a water plan
 prepared by 
 <i>Charles Main </i>, under
 the supervision of the Tennessee
 Valley Authority.  Essentially, the
 Johnston Plan was a combination
 of the Lowdermilk-Hays and the
 MacDonald-Bunger Plans.  The
 new plan included water distribution
 quotas of the Jordan Valley Basin,
 estimated at 1,213 MCM annually,
 among the riparian states.
 <i>[<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/water/pub/#r5">Encyclopedia of Palestine, p 153</a>]</i>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The plan was not well received
 by either Israel or the Arab States.
 Consequently, Arabs and Israelis submitted
 counter proposals for dividing
 water shares - the Arab<i> Technical
 Committee</i> and the 
 <i>Cotton Plan</i>
 respectively.

 Because the available irrigation water
 in the Jordan River Basin does not
 exceed a maximum of 1,213 MCM, the
 Cotton Plan included, within its
 scope, the Litani River to cover
 the water shortfall.  The Cotton Plan
 allocated 400 mcm of the Litani's
 water to Israel and 300 mcm to
 Lebanon.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The period between October 1953
 and July 1955 was a negotiating and
 bargaining stage over the Jordan
 River system.  By the end of 1955, the
 Johnston Plan became more favorable
 to Israel, whose share rose to 450
 mcm while Jordan's shares dropped to
 720 mcm. 
 <i>[<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/water/pub/#r3">Brecker p.204</a>]</i>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The final form of the Plan, even
 though it was rejected by Arab States,
 was used by the United States
 as a basis for its future plans in the region. 
 The failure to reach bilateral agreement
 reinforced each country's
 inclination to proceed independently.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In 1958, Israel reinitiated the National 
 Water Carrier project but with some
 technical changes and also the Seven
 Year Plan was replaced by the <i>Ten
 Year Plan.</i>
 The new plan shifted the diversion point to Eshrd Kinort,at 
 the north- west corner of Lake Tiberias.
 The new diversion project was
 carefully designed in accordance to
 Israel's water allocation in the Revised
 Johnston Plan.  It also refrained
 from invalidating its general principles.

 Water Carrier was to build dams on
 tributaries of the Jordan and Yarmouk
 Rivers, thus reducing the water
 flow to Israel.  In 1965, Syria began
 building dams to divert water from
 the Banias and Dan Rivers in
 the Golan Heights.  These headwater
 diversions threatened to deprive Israel
 of 35% of its water potential from
 the Upper Jordan.  Israel, as a
 riparian state of the Jordan Basin,
 considered this action an aggression on its water resources and sent fighter
 planes to destroy working sites.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Israeli occupation of the Syrian
 Golan Heights in 1967 and subsequent
 control over the Jordan's headwaters
 in the area ended Arab dreams and
 plans for utilizing the water of the
 Jordan Basin.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In 1969 Israel bombed the East Ghor
 Canal in Jordan, keeping it out of
 order for four years.  After secret
 negotiations between Jordan and Israel
 in 1969-1970, Israel permitted the
 repair of the East Ghor Canal while
 Jordan, in return, reaffirmed its adherence
 to the quotas of the Revised Johnston Plan
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="as-h2-63425">Current Situation</a></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 No water plans were devised after the
 Johnston Plan of 1954. However,many events have taken place
 which have altering water distribution quotas.
 Since the 1967 occupation of the
 West Bank, Gaza Strip and the Golan
 Heights, Israel vastly expanded its
 control over water resources in the area,to
 including Mount Hermon, West Bank aquifers
 and the entire length of the
 Jordan River.  As an outcome of
 the 1982 Israeli invasion of South
 Lebanon, Israel extended its command
 even further, to include part of the
 Litani River. Israel's strategy
 is to control and derive maximum benefit
 from all water resources in the occupied
 territories.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 According to 1991 figures, Israel consumes
 1,655 mcm of both surface and
 ground water.  Of this amount, 950 mcm
 originates in neighboring Arab
 States, Golan Heights and the
 West Bank. Whereas, only 155 mcm of
 water orginating in the West Bank actually
 remains there.  A considerable
 amount of this water is consumed by Israeli
 settlements and kibbutizim
 inside the West Bank itself (Figure 3).

<h2><a name="as-h2-63426">Why Previous Solutions Failed</a></h2>
The failure to reach binding agreement
on water rights among the riparian
states of the Jordan River System
may be examined in relation to
international water law.  Riparian
states have failed to abide by the
general principles of internatinal water law,
and have thus, contributed
greatly to the difficulty of
solving today's water crisis.
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Although international water law is
 still underdeveloped and not uniformly
 adhered to, the following principles
 are normally observed by the world
 community:
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
 <li>An equitable share of water is entitled to each basin state. 
  </li>
 <li>Actions which damage the land or property of one state, must be
  avoided and if not, compensated for.
  </li>
 <li>Every state must notify others
  of any actions which may affect it.
  </li>
 <li>Basic water resource data should be shared. 
  </li>
 <li>All basin states should share in the developing and protecting shared
  water resources.
  </li>
 <li>All disputes should be resoved by without resorting to force.
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 If the general principles of international
 water law were adhered to, it is
 likely that many of the past water related
 conflicts would have not taken
 place.  Nevertheless, the following
 analysis attempts to assist in answering
 the question, why previous water
 plans failed.
 </p>
<h3><a name="as-h3-63427"><i>Unrealistic Demands</i></a></h3>
The dream of the Zionist Movement
to settle millions of Jews in
geographic Palestine, placed an
unsustainable demand on all its natural
resources and the resources of neighboring
states, as well.  In order to do
so, Jews sought control over
the headwaters of Jordan-Yarmouk River
System and the Litani River in
Lebanon.
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Chaim Weizman wrote to the British Minister
 David George, describing the
 minimum requirements of a Jewish
 State in the land of Palestine and
 explaining the Jewish perspective
 on the issue of water, stating that:
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
 The whole economic future
 of Palestine is dependant upon its water supply for
 irrigation and for electric power, and
 the water supply must mainly be derived from the
 slopes of Mount Hermon, from the headwaters
 of the Jordan and from the Litani River
 in Lebanon ... We consider it essential
 that the Northern Frontier of Palestine should
 include the Valley of the Litani, for
 a distance of about 25 miles above the bend,
 and the Western and Southern slopes of
 Mount Hermon." [Jewish Observer, p. 22]</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Such ambitions completely neglected
 Arab historic rights, and were thus
 rejected once they were incorporated
 into many of the proposed water
 plans. Both the Lowdermilk and Hays
 Plans called for Jewish control over
 headwaters in the area, as well as the
 Litani River.  The Plans also called
 for the diversion of and storage of
 Arab river water (Jordan and Yarmouk)
 in the Israeli controlled Lake Tiberias.
 Even though in 1944, at the time
 of the Hays Plan, the Arabs constituted
 about 69.6% of the total
 population of historic Palestine,
 the Plans allowed Jews to assume full
 control over the water projects.  Consequently,
 Arabs were prevented from
 irrigating vast areas of rich
 land in the Jordan Valley.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The scarce water resources of the Jordan
 River Basin were threatened by
 Israeli plans to irrigate and bloom
 the Negev. The National Water Carrier,
 included in the Israeli Seven
 Year Plan, Cotton Plan and the Revised
 Johnston plan, proposed to divert this
 water exclusively inside the Green
 Line.  This was unrealistic to the Arabs
 as it dropped water levels of the
 Jordan River and prevented Arab farmers,
 on both sides, from cultivating
 their lands.
 </p>
<h3><a name="as-h3-63428"><i>Inequity and Neglect of Inhabitant's Rights</i></a></h3>
The Arab inhabitants of the land of
Palestine, who historically had control
many of the plans that where
threatening their civil rights.
The Arab population recognized that
accepting such plans would enable aggressive
violations of their water rights
and threaten the survival of the
projects they supported on the Jordan
River.
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 On the other hand, the occupying
 authorities of Palestine supported the
 establishment of a Jewish State and
 provided secured natural resources for
 its projected development. In order
 to actualize this objective, the British
 Government neglected the Arab presence
 in the land.  Decisions regarding
 water plans and water rights in
 area were taken solely by the British
 Mandate or French.  Palestinians,
 in particular, were not consulted
 regarding any of the proposed plans,
 both during and after the Mandate
 period.  The Revised Johnston Plan,
 which is still in effect tody, neglected
 to mention the Palestinian people. 
 Undoubtadly, this is one of the most
 blatant violations of water rights of
 region's indigenous peoples.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Throughout the Mandate period,
 the British Government granted the
 Jewish people many privileges, including
 control over the natural resources
 in the area.  In 1926, even though
 Arabs constituted a majority of the
 population with 749,402 inhabitants
 out of a total of 898,902, Jews were
 granted the following:
 </p>
<ol>
 <li>A 70 year concession to utilize The Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers' water.
  [Rutenberg Concession].
  </li>
 <li>A Concession for reclamation of
  the Huleh Lake and swamps. The
  Concession were resold to the
  Jews for a 70 year period.
  </li>
 <li>Utilization of Al Oja (Yarkon)
  River in Jaffa area.
  </li>
 <li>A 70 year concession to
  utilize the Dead Sea water to produce salts and
  minerals.
  </li>
 <li>Concession of oil prospecting
  in Palestine.</li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Although, all of the Yarmouk River's
 and most of the Jordan River's water
 is located inside Arab territories,
 the concession, later known as the
 Rutenberg Concession, to utilize this
 water was given solely to the Palestine
 Electricity Corporation.  Profits
 of this project were shared between the
 British Government and the Corporation,
 depriving Arab countries their
 rightful share of the profits.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Lowdermilk Plan was even more
 extreme and unjust.  After
 presenting his plan, Lowdermilk suggested
 that if the Arabs are unable or
 unwilling to live in an industrial developed
 Jewish state, then they should
 be transferred to areas near the
 Euphrates and the Tigris Valleys.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Although the Lowdermilk-Hays project
 neglected the rights and
 furthermore the presence of the Arab
 inhabitants in the area, it served as a
 reference point for almost all of the
 future Israeli schemes and also to the
 Partition Plan of Palestine. The
 Zionist Movement forced the
 Lowdermilk-Hays plan onto the table
 of those partitioning Palestine in
 1947.  Dr. Immanuel Newman, President
 of the Zionist Organization of
 America, confirmed this by stating:
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
 "Those who had been responsible for
 working out details of the United Nations
 Partition plan, were familiar with the basic
 aspects of the Lowdermilk-Hays project
 and took it largely into account in drawing the
 boundaries of the new state".
 <i>[<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/water/pub/#r11">Saliba, p. 20</a>]</i>
 </blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="as-h3-63429"><i>Increasing Mistrust and Lack of
 Cooperation</i></a></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Zionist Movement, since its establishment
 in 1882, vocalized its aim of
 settling the land of Palestine and
 controlling its natural resources.  This
 desire to control the natural resources
 was considered intolerable by the
 Arabs.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Jewish claims to the Land of Palestine,
 significant parts of the Arab
 States of Jordan, Lebanon and Syria
 and their plans to seize control over its
 natural resources created a rift of
 mistrust and hatred between the Arabs
 and the Jews.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Since most of the schemes where
 hostage to political agendas and
 geographical fears, they could not possibly
 succeed unless all the parties
 concerned accept them and commit to
 cooperate and maintain them.  This
 was a major factor in the rejection
 the Johnston Plan.  The Plan was
 rejected by the Arab States due to political
 fears since it grants Israel de
 facto rights over Arab water resources
 in the area. Georgiana Stevens, one
 of Eric Johnston's assistants, wrote
 that,
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
 The Arab Government could not bring
 themselves to give acceptance to an
 arrangement that would also help Israel's
 development ..  [and] accept a plan
 that was tantamount to tacit acceptance of Israel's
 existence ..  thus the momentum achieved
 during the Johnston negotiations died out"
 [<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/water/pub/#r12">Stevens, p. 32, 33</a>].</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Plans were devised by only one
 of the parties involved. A total absence
 of cooperation among the riparian
 states lead to the failure of these
 plans.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="as-h3-63430"><i>Lack of Scientific Objectivity</i></a></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 To achieve political aims, many
 of the water plans lacked technical and
 scientific objectivity and were therefore
 difficult to apply.  Scientific data,
 such as the estimation of water potential
 in the area, was not accurate and
 consequently, most of the
 schemes were technical failures. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In the Lowdermilk Plan, which was
 a reference to all later Jewish/Israeli
 water plans, the total irrigation
 potential was estimated as 1.2 million
 dunums (300,000 acres). This figure
 is almost double the area of irrigable
 land in the Jordan Valley.  Such a falsified
 estimation created a substantial
 surplus, allowing irrigation water
 to be used elsewhere.  This surplus is
 utilized in, for example, the "out
 basin" Negev area, presently used to grow
 roses and "to make the desert bloom".
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry's
 evaluation of The Hays Plan noted that,
 </p>
<blockquote>
 "The [British] Water Commissioner is doubtful 
 of the validity of the use to
 which much of the data accepted by Mr.
 Hays and predicted by Mr. Savage is put".</blockquote>
Also the report stated that :
<blockquote>
 Without close checking and reference to more detailed
 information that is now available, it
 is impossible to accept the estimated costs of the
 [Hays's] scheme ... The scheme
 envisages the irrigation of two and a half million
 dunums with nearly two thousand million
 cubic meters of water a year ... It cannot be
 agreed that this continual flow would
 be available for use in a dry year after allowing
 for losses in transmission ... This
 and many other features in the scheme demand very
 careful scrutiny.  The dams proposed
 at Hasbani, Yarmuk and Beisan and their
 complementary canals, the elimination
 of the present hydro-electrical works at Jisr
 Majami', all highly expensive items,
 will not, it would seem, ensure an increased water
 supply of more than a few cubic
 meters per second. The quantity of storm-water
 available of storage in hill reservoirs
 has been estimated optimistically, ... This and the
 economic implications of the proposal
 to convey irrigation water from the Lebanon to
 the Egyptian frontier cannot be
 accepted without further examination."[Survey of Palestine p. 413]</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The idea of diverting and storing Yarmouk
 River water in Lake Tiberias,
 mentioned in Ionides, Hays, MacDonald
 and Johnston Plans, was
 technically and scientifically unacceptable.
 Lake Tiberias water is saline,
 exceeding 300 ppm, while the Yarmouk
 River's water does not exceed 80
 ppm.  Storing water in Lake Tiberias
 would increase the salinity of water
 used for irrigation and agricultural
 purposes by Arabs.  Also, the high
 evaporation rate and water loss in Lake
 Tiberias may reach as high as 300
 MCM each year, while such loss would
 be reduced if water was stored in a
 site along the River's route.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="as-h3-63431"><i>Neglect of Geopolitical Boundaries</i></a></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Several water plans failed to take into
 consideration the existing geopolitical
 boundaries and cease-fire lines. Arab
 water control stations, such as dams,
 hydroelectric plants, and water reserves,
 were often designed to exist outside
 Arab boundaries.  The storage of Yarmouk
 River water in Lake Tiberias
 is one clear example. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Therefore, not only the Ionides, Hays,
 MacDonald and Johnston Plans were
 technically and were scientifically
 inaccurate, but they also neglected the
 geopolitical boundaries between the
 Jewish/Israeli State and the rest of the
 Arab States.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="as-h3-63432"><i>Lack of Arab Expertise</i></a></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 It is unfortunate that none of the water
 plans prior to 1953 were conducted
 by Arab experts. The plans commissioned
 by Arab governments were
 conducted by non-Arabs. The Arab commissioned
 MacDonald Plan and
 Bunger Plan were conducted by a British
 and American experts,
 respectively.  The lack of expertise
 prevented the Arabs from formulating
 plans in accordance to their needs and
 aspirations. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="as-h2-63433">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 A binding agreement regarding water
 rights among the riparian states in
 the region has never been obtained.
 With the constantly changing political
 Land demographic conditions as well as
 de facto boundary alterations in the
 area, water distribution quotas
 and schemes must necessarily adapt and
 develop.  The current disproporational
 distribution of water resources is no
 longer sustainable.  In the past,
 unsustainabilty has grown into conflict.
 Hopefully today, the use of force and military
 power to gain control of
 water resources is no more acceptable to the
 international community.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 It is time for this community to
 take action, reversing unjust water
 distribution and ensuring a fair and
 ecologically sound future.  Without a
 clear and equitable settlement
 of the water crisis combined with an
 increasing demand for water, will eventually
 exacerbate into yet another
 war driving at control another's water
 resources.  A water war.
