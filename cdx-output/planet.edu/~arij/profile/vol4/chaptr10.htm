<h4>Air Pollution</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Pollutants are substances in the air other than normal
 constituents.  These pollutants are formed and emitted through
 natural processes and human activities.  Near cities and in populated
 areas, more than 90% of the volume of air pollutants is the result
 of human activity.  The presence of air pollutants is of great
 concern because of their potential adverse effects on human health
 and environment.  Potential adverse effects not directly related
 to human health include damage of vegetation and materials and
 visibility degradation.<br>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Types of air pollutants</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Air pollutants can be found in gaseous or particulate
 forms.  Gaseous air pollutants are classified into inorganic
 pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide
 and ozone, and organic pollutants.  The particulate matter found
 in the air can be made up of many different substances including
 mineral, metallic, and organic compounds.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Sources of air pollution </h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Air pollution emission sources can be divided into
 two categories: mobile sources and stationary sources<br>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Mobile sources </h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Emissions from mobile sources are those generated
 by the combustion of fuels in vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles,
 etc.).  Such pollutants include carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides,
 hydrocarbons, particulate matter and sulfur compounds (depending
 on the fuel used).  In general, land based transport is one of
 the major contributors to the deterioration of air quality.  
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The inhabitants of Ramallah District own approximately
 17.6 % of the total number of vehicles in the West Bank.  According
 to the transportation officer at the West Bank Department for
 Vehicle Licensing in Beit El, in the year 1994, there were approximately
 19,276 motor vehicle in the district of which about 13,562 (70%)
 were private.  The motorization level (total number of vehicles
 per thousand of people) was about 73 for privately owned vehicles,
 which is very low compared to 191.5 in Israel at the end of 1994
 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#36">Statistical Abstract of Israel, 1995</a>).  These vehicles
 emit various
 types of pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen
 oxides and particulate matter.  The number of transportation vehicles
 registered in the Ramallah District by type is shown in Table
 10.1 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#38">Transportation Officer, Beit El, 1995</a>).

 Based on the WHO transportation air emission inventories
 (table 10.2), rough calculations estimate that the annual emission
 of air pollutants due to gasoline combustion is close to 0.6 tons
 per vehicle.  Furthermore, an estimated 9,020 tons of CO, 650
 tons of SOx, 740 tons of NOx, 1,100 tons of VOC and 42 tons of
 Pb are emitted each year in the district due to registered local
 driving only.  These emission figures are believed to be the minimum
 because there are many unregistered old cars which is difficult
 to estimate.

 Although public transportation is available throughout
 the Ramallah District through buses and taxis and are relatively
 inexpensive, private transportation in the West Bank are gaining
 popularity causing continuous growing in their number.  The annual
 increasing rate of private cars in the West Bank is about 12%
 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#36">Statistical Abstract of Israel, 1995</a>) which is faster
 than the
 population growth rate (approximately 3.5%).  It is evident that
 public transportation systems are decreasingly competitive to
 the private ones which provides convenience and flexibility that
 seem to be highly valued by the inhabitants. Therefore, the problem
 of vehicle emissions is expected to grow in the coming years.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 With the new political changes, it is expected that
 the city of Ramallah and Al-Bireh will be a growing commercial
 center and that the volume of traffic will increase there.  Tourism
 is also expected to develop thereby increasing the use of rental
 vehicles, taxis and buses.  An increase in the use of trucks (both
 gasoline and diesel based) is also expected.  Vehicle emissions
 is expected to increase in the coming years demanding emission
 controls on vehicles.  New programs in traffic management to reduce
 congestion will also help control emission of poisonous gases
 from mobile sources.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Stationary Sources<br>
 </h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Air pollution emissions come from many stationary</p>
<h4>
 </h4>
sources in the Ramallah District such as:<br>
<ul>
 <li>external and internal combustion of coal, fuel
  oil, natural gas and diesel-fired engine; 
  </li>
 <li>solid waste disposal and open burning;
  </li>
 <li>chemical processing of paint and varnish, pharmaceuticals,
  soap and detergents;
  </li>
 <li>mineral products processing in quarries, brick
  and clay product, concrete batching, glass manufacturing and asphalt
  roofing.
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The industrial sector in Ramallah District is relatively
 active compared to other districts in the West Bank.  Industry
 is considered the second major source of gaseous emissions and
 air pollution after mobile sources.  Although large industrial
 plants do not exist, there are clusters of small-scale plants
 operating obsolete equipment, with no emissions controls that
 are significant polluters.<br>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Quarrying, stone cutting and crushing facilities
 contribute a great deal to air quality deterioration through the
 generation of particulate matter.  The facilities lack air filtration
 systems to collect dust and particulate so it is released into
 the air.  Such facilities have an adverse impact when located
 close to residential areas or areas of high natural and landscape
 value because it may impact the human health and plant development.
 In Ramallah District, there are several quarries and stone cutting
 facilities which release large quantities of particulate matter
 and dust into the atmosphere.  Moreover, transportation of the
 rock from the quarry to the centers of demand is also a major
 problem.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Municipal solid waste dumping sites are potential
 sources of emissions as gases, mainly carbon dioxide and methane,
 generate from the natural decomposition of organic wastes.  Methane
 can migrate through the soil and accumulate in closed areas, it
 is highly explosive and can be a significant source of danger.
 VOC, often toxic and sometimes carcinogenic, also are released
 in small quantities.  Also very important, there is a significant
 amount of the waste that is openly burned either at the dump site,
 along road sides or at the point of collection. This is often
 the case in densely populated areas where large amounts of garbage
 is generated and collection and disposal is inadequate.  Emissions
 from burning may impact the human health and the environment.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 An air monitoring system to measure the air pollutants
 is needed to provide the data to establish regulations and standards
 for air emissions.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Noise Pollution
 </h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Noise pollution has not been studied in the West
 bank, scientific measurements and data about noise levels are
 not available.  Field observations provide information about noise
 sources commonly found in the district.  Sources of noise include:
 low flying Israeli military aircraft, and sonic booms produced
 when the sound barrier is broken; traffic, especially in the center
 of Ramallah where frequent traffic jams occur; and stationary
 sources such as stone cutting facilities.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The need for well enforced regulation of noise pollution
 is justified by the fact that sustained loud noise may cause health
 problems and interfere with the work environment, communication,
 sleep and inter-room privacy.  In addition,  it has negative effects
 on wildlife
