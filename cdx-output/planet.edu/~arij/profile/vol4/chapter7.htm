<h3>Historical Background</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Ramallah is a Palestinian
 city located 13 km to the north of Jerusalem.  It extends over
 several hills with an altitude of 872 meter above sea level. 
 More than one story explains the naming of Ramallah with its present
 name.  One story attributes the derivation of the name to that
 Ramallah is built on a place "Ramtaem Sofeem" which
 is mentioned in the Old Testament where the Nabi Samuel born.
 Other story says that the name Ramallah is composed of Ram, an
 Aramaic word meaning hill or high place, and Allah, the Arabic
 word for God.  Therefore, the name of Ramallah was originally
 either Ram or Rama, which lasted until the time of Muslim conquest
 in the seventh century.  When the Arabs came to Rama, they seem
 to have added Allah to either Ram or Rama, and the site became
 known as Ramallah.  Aramaic was the language of the people of
 Palestine from 400 B.C. up to the end of the Byzantine period
 in A.D. 640.  Since the word Ram is Aramaic, the site of Ramallah
 was probably first settled by Aramaic speaking people prior to
 A.D. 640.  So, it seems that prior to the Muslim conquest, Ramallah
 was temporarily settled from time to time throughout the centuries
 by inhabitants who lived there a while and then left.  It may
 have became a permenant village in the sixteenth century, when
 the Haddad family who lived in the vicinty between Karak and Al-Shoubak
 came and settled in Ramallah (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#35">Shaheen, N. 1992</a>) <br>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Ramallah city served as an
 important crossroad in the ancient times and in the present between
 Jerusalem and Nablus, and from Ramallah to Jericho and the Jordan
 Valley.  A number of prehistoric sites and Bronze Age tombs have
 been found in and around the city.  Ras et Tahuna, within Ramallah
 city bounderies, is a hill which was inhabited in the Chalcolithic
 and in the Early and Middle Bronze Ages, in the Iron Age, Persian
 and Arab Periods.<br>
