<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In terms of agriculture, Ramallah District is impressively
 diverse in the types of crops produced.  This is due to the diversity
 in the climate and growing conditions within the district.  
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Agro-climatic Conditions</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The district's total agricultural area is estimated
 at 2,3831.1 hectares during the 1993/94 growing season.  This
 area encompasses three distinctive agro-ecological zones within
 the regions of the Eastern Slopes and the Central High Lands (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#31">Ramallah
 Agricultural Department, 1994</a>).  The altitude of the eastern region
 ranges from 0 to 200 m above sea level, and rainfall is minimal,
 only 200 to 400 mm, therefore, agricultural production is limited.
 The topography of the central region rises westerly from 200
 m to more than 1000 m above sea level.  Average
 rainfall in this area ranges between 400 and 700 mm per year,
 making it quite suitable for rainfed agricultural production.
 The western area descends gradually to almost 500 m above sea
 level at the western border of the district and receives 500 and
 600 mm of rainfall annually, making it also suitable for rainfed
 agriculture (see <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/fig61.gif">Figure 6.1</a>).

<h3>Plant Production</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Rainfed agriculture is dominant throughout the district,
 comprising 99.6%, (23737.7 hectares) of the total cultivated area
 in the 1993/94 growing season.  The size of the cultivated area
 varies yearly depending upon the climatic conditions, especially
 with the start of the rainy season, which has a dramatic effect
 on the success of field crops, forages and vegetables.  Only 93.4
 hectares of the total cultivated area were devoted to irrigated
 agriculture in 1993/94 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#31">Ramallah Agricultural Department,
 1994</a>).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The total plant production in the 1993/94 growing
 season was approximately 34,954.2 tons.  Fruit trees occupied
 the largest area and have the highest yield by weight.  Fruit
 accounted for 79.7% of the total cultivated area and 78.3% of
 the agricultural production.  Field crops and forages accounted
 for 17% of the total cultivated area and 12.4% of the agricultural
 production.  The remaining area and production were devoted to
 vegetables (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/fig62.gif">Figure 6.2</a>).

<h3>Fruit Trees
 </h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Almost all fruit trees are grown under rainfed conditions
 (18,959.6 hectares), only 20.1 hectares are used for irrigated
 fruit trees.  Most of the cultivated fruit trees are located in
 the central mountains, though some are found in the western region,
 and very few in the eastern region of the district.  The production
 during the 1993/94 growing season was 27,373.3 tons, rainfed cultivation
 contributed approximately 99.5% of the total production (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/fig63.gif">Figure
 6.3</a>).

<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Irrigated orchards of fruit trees are found on small
 areas of land in few villages.  Lemons occupy the largest area
 with 12 hectares, followed by other varieties such as pomegranates,
 oranges, and guavas.  The total production of irrigated trees
 was 142 tons with an average productivity of 5,500 kg per hectare
 for pomegranates and 9,000 kg per hectare for guavas.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Olives are the dominant fruit trees grown, occupying
 approximately 80.1% of the area devoted to fruit trees and 63.8%
 of the total cultivated area in the district.  Olive trees are
 heavily cultivated in the central region, less in the western
 area, and sparsely planted in the east.  The dominance of olives
 in the district can be explained by the following factors:
 </p>
<ul>
 <li>The mountainous and rocky topography of the central
  and western regions make it difficult to plant and cultivate field
  crops, forages and vegetables;
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>Since the most active roots of olive trees are
  concentrated in the first meter depth of the soil, they adapt
  well to the mountainous conditions of the West Bank, yielding
  well when rainfall is good;  
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>Palestinians have a historical attachment to
  olive trees.  It is still possible to see trees which are hundreds
  years old and still producing; 
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>Due to the longevity and sentimental value of
  olive trees, it is often used as the tree of choice when land
  is being planted to prevent it from being confiscated by Israeli
  settlers or military authorities. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 However, approximately 1.3% of the area planted with
 olives is covered with unproductive trees.  Furthermore, in spite
 of their large area, olives contribute just 27.5% of the total
 production of fruit trees.  This low production is, in large part,
 due to three factors: the alternative bearing phenomenon in the
 olive trees, where they bear heavily in one year and very little
 in the next; the old age of many trees in the district; low maintenance
 by farmers, especially in terms of soil cultivation, fertilization
 and the pruning of trees (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/fig64.gif">Figure 6.4</a>).

 Stone fruits, including plums, almonds (hard and
 soft), peaches, and apricots, are the next prominent with a total
 area of 1,705.1 hectares and a total production of 10,015.7 tons.
 Although, stone fruits covered only 9% of the total area of fruit
 trees, they produced approximately 36.6% of the total fruit production
 in the 1993/94 growing season.  The productivity of stone fruits
 is generally high.  Amongst stone fruits, plums are the most productive,
 averaging 9,700 kg/hectare, while soft almonds have the lowest
 productivity with just 900 kg/hectare (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#31">Ramallah Agricultural
 Department,
 1994</a>). 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Fig trees covered an area of 1,170.7 hectares and
 produced 4,683 tons in the 1993/94 growing season.  The average
 productivity of figs was relatively high, at 4,000 kg/hectare.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Grapes are not widely grown in the Ramallah District,
 covering only 811 hectares.  Most of these vines simply run on
 the ground (810 hectares), only small area is planted with a trellis
 training system.  Grape on trellis produces approximately 10,000
 kg/hectare annually, compared to 5,000 kg/hectare for ground grapes.
 However, ground grapes have v130
 liters of milk annually, and is capable of bearing twins in up
 to 80% of births.  While Shami and hybrid goats can produce 270
 liters of milk annually and produce twins in more than 90% of
 the births, the costs of feeding and management are much greater
 than for the local breeds.  Thus the number of Shami and hybrid
 goats continues to be low, throughout the West Bank (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#2">Abo
 Omar,
 1991</a>).

<h4>Poultry
 </h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are approximately 545 farms of broilers in
 the Ramallah District, with an average capacity of 1,689 birds
 per round.  Four rounds are reared during the year.  The number
 of broiler chicken produced in the Ramallah District was around
 3,681,500 in 1994. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are approximately 160 layer farms, with an
 average capacity of 1,637 hens (Ramallah Agricultural Department,
 1994).  The total number of laying hens are estimated at 236,000
 of which 72% are old enough to produce eggs (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm">PARC &amp; Arab

 Forum, No.2, 1994</a>).

<h4>Apiculture
 </h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are approximately 4,565 beehives in the district,
 of which 4,129 are modern hives and the rest are traditional (old)
 hives (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#31">Ramallah Agricultural department, 1994</a>).  Of
 the total
 number of hives, 63% have local bees (Baladi), while the rest
 have the Italian variety or hybrid varieties.  On average, local
 bees produce 2.5 kg/year of honey, while Italian and Hybrid bees
 produce 11 kg/year.  The total production of honey was 23,308
 kg in 1994.  Approximately 62% of the produced honey is sold in
 the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the rest is sold at the site
 of production (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm">PARC &amp; Arab Thought Forum, No.3, 1994</a>).

<h3>Agricultural Institutions
 </h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Ramallah Agricultural Department</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Ramallah Agricultural Department in Ramallah
 city, is a governmental department that provides extension services
 for farmers, especially in the areas of plant and livestock production.
 Occasionally, they are responsible for the distribution of free
 agricultural materials such as seeds, fertilizers, or vaccines
 to the farmers.  There is also a veterinary section which provides
 all kinds of assistance for livestock production, such as, disease
 control and farmers training on new methods of livestock management.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Agricultural Cooperatives</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 A number of organized agricultural cooperatives specialized
 in particular products or activities (such as a beekeepers cooperative,
 or agricultural marketing cooperative) exist in the district.
 Their main target is to facilitate agricultural activities and
 marketing.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Other Agricultural Institutions</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as PARC,
 MA'AN Center, the Bir Zeit Literacy Center and the Agricultural
 Services Center are also active in the area.  They are especially
 focused on activities such as: the environmentally sustainable
 development of agriculture, especially through the adaptation
 of permaculture; improving the productivity of the land through
 more modern agricultural practices; improving farmer standards
 of living, and literacy; and the role of rural women in rural
 development and agriculture.  Other centers such as the Birzeit
 Center for Occupational and Environmental Health and Science (COEHS)
 are involved in chemical analysis of water and soil and testing
 the  pesticide toxicity levels in people. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Problems and Future Prospects 
 </h3>
<ul>
 <li>The small size of land holdings, reaches to less
  than one hectare per farmer in the western region of the district,
  obviously, limits the potential productivity of farmers even under
  optimal conditions of the most intensive farming practices.
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>The price of agricultural inputs is quite high,
  and almost all production and wholesale distribution are controlled
  by Israel.  This explains why farmers tend to use limited amounts
  of inputs.
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>Mechanization is not widely used to maximize
  production and improved seeds are not easily available to farmers
  in the market.  Evidence to this is that the production of field
  crops and forages falls far below the market demand in the district,
  with the large majority of these products being imported from
  Israel and other countries. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>While fruit trees have good production potential,
  there have been problems in their marketing, especially during
  the closure of the Palestinian Territories to Israel.   Markets
  to Jordan are also limited by Israeli authorities.
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>Currently, there is no system to protect the
  farmers from agricultural losses.  This system of protection is
  especially important in transitional periods when the access to
  surrounding markets is unpredictable.  Without this protecti
