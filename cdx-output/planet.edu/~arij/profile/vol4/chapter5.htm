<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Until the 1950's, Ramallah District depended upon
 rainfall collection cisterns and small local springs for its water
 supply. However, the growth in population and the influx of thousands
 of refugees from the nearby cities and villages, have multiplied
 the demand on drinking water. The existing infrastructure could
 not provide the needed water, so the municipalities of Ramallah
 and Al-Bireh and the municipal council of the Arab sector of Jerusalem
 established the Ramallah and Al-Bireh Water Company. This company
 expanded the water supply by drawing water from the E'in Fara
 springs northeast of Jerusalem and from E'in Qinya springs. Even
 after these two projects, the water supply could not meet the
 domestic water needs. In 1963, the Jordanian government concluded
 an agreement with the International Development Agency (IDA) to
 construct new drinking water projects in Jordan. One of these
 projects was the E'in Samia Water Project designed to supplement
 the Ramallah District with drinking water supply. Also, the IDA
 agreed with the Jordanian Government to establish the Jerusalem
 Water Undertaking in 1966 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#20">JWU, 1991</a>). Since that time,
 the Jerusalem
 Water Undertaking (JWU) is responsible for administrating water
 sources and providing domestic water for most of the population
 in the Ramallah District and some villages in Jerusalem District.

<h3>Hydrogeological Status</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Groundwater Aquifer Systems</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Ramallah District overlies two main aquifer systems:
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>Lower Cenomanian Aquifer System
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The geologic formations representing this aquifer
   system are the Lower and Upper Beit Kahil. Lower Beit Kahil constitutes
   the lower part of the Lower Cenomanian that is composed of gray
   marly and dolomitic limestone with some joints forming an aquitard
   (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#32">Rofe &amp; Raffety, 1963</a>). Upper Beit Kahil constitutes
   the upper
   part of the Lower Cenomanian and consists of dolomitic, chalky,
   and marly limestone with karstification and well-jointed features
   forming a good aquifer confined by the overlying Yatta aquitard
   (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#33">Rofe &amp; Raffety, 1965</a>). The E'in-Samia wells No.
   3 and No.
   4 tap this aquifer system.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
 </li>
 <li>Upper Cenomanian Aquifer System
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The geologic formation comprising this aquifer system
   is the Hebron formation, and is composed of limestone and dolomitic
   limestone with chalky bands and chert nodules. Karsts and joints
   give this formation excellent aquiferous characteristics (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#32">Rofe
   &amp; Raffety, 1963</a>). <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/fig51.gif">Figure 5.1</a> shows the groundwater

<h4>Groundwater Basins</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Groundwater basins in the Ramallah District are divided
 as follows:
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<ol>
 <li>The western groundwater basin (Auja Tamaseeh sub-basin):
  This basin underlies approximately 65% of the Ramallah District
  and its water flows towards the west. Shebtin wells tap this basin.
  </li>
 <li>The eastern groundwater basin: This basin underlies
  the eastern part of the Ramallah District (35%). Its water flows
  towards the east and southeast. A large part of the eastern area
  of the Ramallah District is underlain by the Jerusalem-Ramallah
  sub-basin.
  </li>

<h4>Groundwater Wells</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The groundwater wells, supplying domestic water to
 the people in the Ramallah District, are controlled by the Jerusalem
 Water undertaking (JWU), Mekorot and Jerusalem Municipality. Israeli
 companies are also controlling other groundwater wells in the
 Ramallah District directed to provide the Israeli settlers living
 in the West Bank with domestic water.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h5>Wells owned by the Jerusalem Water Undertaking(JWU)
 </h5>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Jerusalem Water Undertaking (JWU) owns five wells
 at E'in-Samia area to the east of Ramallah city. These wells are
 located to the east of the regional groundwater shed, tapping
 the eastern basin aquifer. They contribute to only one third of
 the current water supply in the district. Basic information about
 E'in-Samia wells are shown in Table 5.1. Well No. 1 is a seasonal
 well depending on the annual rainfall, while well No.2 is used
 mainly for irrigation purposes. Well No.2a is a new well, constructed
 as an alternative for well No.2 at the same location and expected
 to operate soon at a pumping rate of 300 m<sup>3</sup>/hr. These
 wells (E'in-Samia wells No.1, No.2, and No.2a) tap the Upper Cenomanian
 aquifer system. Recently, the E'in Samia well No.3 was equipped
 with a higher yield pump to increase its capacity. The well is
 pumping at its new capacity since December, 1995. Wells No.3 and
 No.4 tap the Lower Cenomanian aquifer system. The JWU had constructed
 a well at E'in Sinya close to Jifna village. Drilling failed to
 tap any aquifer and stopped at a depth of 500m. They are planning
 to construct a new well at E'in Samia (No.6) that will be funded
 by the German Government through GTZ. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h5>Israeli sources</h5>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 A large quantity of water is purchased from Israeli
 sources and from Jerusalem Municipality to supplement the low
 water production of the E'in-Samia wells. The Israeli water company,
 Mekorot, controls over Shebtin wells No.4 and No.5 in the Ramallah
 District. These wells located to the west of the groundwater shed
 and tap the Upper Cenomanian aquifer system.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Mekorot is also responsible for supplying domestic
 water to 22 villages and 6 Israeli Settlements within Ramallah
 District through the West Bank Water Department (WBWD). The total
 water supply from Mekorot sources is about 6.5 MCM/yr (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#21">Mekorot,
 1995</a>). Approximately 4.3 MCM/yr were purchased from Mekorot and
 distributed by JWU, while 2.2 MCM/yr were distributed by WBWD.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h5>Israeli controlled Wells</h5>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are nine other Israeli wells that are controlled
 by Israel in the Ramallah District. These tap the western groundwater
 basin and are connected with the Israeli national carrier to exclusively
 serve the Israelis. Table 5.1 shows their names and basic details.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 A comparison between well depth and depth to water
 of the Palestinian wells and Israeli wells is shown in <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/fig53.gif">Figure
 5.3</a>. Clearly, the depths for Israeli wells are much deeper than
 those of the Palestinians which means that the Israeli wells tap
 multi aquifer and so abstracting more water.

<h4>Springs</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Springs are a major source of domestic water for
 many villages in the West Bank. Villages not connected to municipal
 water are depending on spring water for their living. In the Ramallah
 District, there are 122 minor springs with an average discharge
 little exceeding 0.01 liters/sec. Some of these springs are used
 for domestic and low scale irrigation purposes and many of them
 are not utilized. The water of these springs flows in open channels
 causing water losses by evaporation and percolation through the
 ground to be very high. However, the total average annual discharge
 (1970-1994) of the seven major springs in the district is estimated
 to be 3.83 MCM, about 90% of the total discharge of all springs
 in the Ramallah District (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#24">Nuseibeh &amp; Nasser Eddin, 1995</a>).
 The basic details of these seven major springs are shown in Table
 5.1. Figures 5.4-5.7 show the annual discharge variation with
 rainfall of the main springs in the Ramallah District from 1982
 to 1994 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#24">Nuseibeh &amp; Nasser Eddin, 1995</a>).

<h4>Rainwater harvesting</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Cisterns are widely used as a supplementary source
 of water supply in the Ramallah District. Most Palestinians use
 the rooftops of their houses as a catchment area to collect rainwater
 during winter time. This water is stored in cisterns of different
 volumes constructed underneath or next to the houses. The average
 capacity of the existing cisterns is 70 m<sup>3</sup>. This source
 of water is very important to Palestinians all over the West Bank
 but more important to those Palestinians who are not connected
 to a water distribution system and where there is a shortage of
 water during the summer.

<h3>Water Quality</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Water is tested periodically by the JWU and the WBWD
 to insure the quality of the water supply. The chemical analysis
 is conducted at the Center of Environmental and Occupational Health
 Science at Bir Zeit University. Results of chemical and physical
 analysis indicate that the water fits within the parameters for
 drinking water.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Physical Water Quality Tests
 </h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 These tests include measurements of the electrical
 conductivity (EC), hydrogen activity product (pH), total dissolved
 solids (TDS), and turbidity. Results are available for E'in Samia
 wells No.1, No.2, and No.3, Shua'fat connection and Ramallah station
 from five samples taken between 1991-1995. Table 5.2 shows the
 variation over time in electrical conductivity (EC) and total
 dissolved solids (TDS) for the E'in Samia wells, Shua'fat connection

<h4>Chemical Water Quality Tests</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 These tests include routine chemical analysis of
 major cations and anions for E'in Samia wells and partial chemical
 analysis for chloride and nitrates in the Israeli wells and the
 major springs in the Ramallah District (Tables 5.2 and 5.3). Table
 5.2 shows the variation over time of the major cations and anions
 of water in wells No.1, No.2, and No.3, Shua'fat connection and
 Ramallah station. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Diagrams and contour maps are used to model the hydrochemical
 data to identify the quality of the groundwater. The Wilcox diagram
 (1955) is used to classify water for irrigation purposes depending
 on the conductivity (EC) and the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR)
 values. The Wilcox diagram for water sources in the Ramallah District,
 E'in Samia wells No.1, No.2, No.3, and No.4 as well as the water
 purchased from Mekorot at the connection sites, is shown in Figure
 5.8. The water of the E'in Samia wells has medium salinity hazard
 and low sodium hazard and is therefore suitable for irrigation.
 The external water sources received at Ramallah and Shua'fat connection
 sites have greater values of EC as they are located in the region
 of high salinity and low sodium hazard.

 The Piper Diagram (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/fig59.gif">Figure 5.9</a>) identifies types of
 the water sources in the Ramallah District. The figure shows that
 all water sources are earth alkaline with prevailing bicarbonate
 except that of E'in Samia well No.2 and the water purchased from
 Mekorot. These two sources have earth alkaline water with prevailing
 bicarbonate and increased portion of alkalis.

 the groundwater quality of E'in Samia Wells is better than that

 the groundwater from all sources (E'in Samia domestic wells, that

 groundwater basin such as E'in Samia wells field, and to the west
 in the areas underlain by the western groundwater basin (Mekorot
 wells).

  These wells tap the western aquifer system and their natural flow
  is to the west. The extensive pumping from these wells has caused
  the water to reverse its direction towards the southeast. Pumping

<h3>Water Supply &amp; Demand
 </h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Water distribution in the Ramallah District is the
 responsibility of the Jerusalem Water Undertaking (JWU) and the
 West Bank Water Department (WBWD).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Jerusalem Water Undertaking (JWU)</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The JWU distributes water to approximately 200,000
 people including Ramallah and Al-Bireh cities, 44 villages in
 the Ramallah and Jerusalem Districts and 10,000 people from the
 Israeli military forces. Figure 5.14 shows the existing water
 distribution network controlled by the JWU. In 1994, approximately
 66.3% (5.0 MCM) of the total water distributed (7.5 MCM) was purchased
 from Mekorot and the Jerusalem Municipality. The rest (2.5 MCM)
 of the distributed water was pumped from the E'in Samia wells.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>West Bank Water Department (WBWD)</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Shebtin Wells No. 4 and 5, controlled by Mekorot,
 are used to provide water for domestic purposes through the West
 Bank Water Department. These wells also serve 6 Israeli settlements
 and 22 Palestinian villages in the Ramallah District that are
 not connected to the water distribution network of the JWU.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The villages served by the WBWD constitutes 18% of
 the Ramallah District's population. Approximately 2.2 MCM of water
 are distributed by Mekorot through the WBWD. The total water quantity
 received from Mekorot either purchased and distributed by the
 JWU or directly distributed through the WBWD is 6.5 MCM (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#21">Mekorot,
 1995</a>). Table 5.4 shows the external water sources and the quantities
 of water purchased in the 1994.

<ul>
 <li>7,244,678 m<sup>3</sup> were purchased from Israel

  </li>
 <li>2,548,567 m<sup>3</sup> were produced from E'in

<h3>Distribution Network</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The original network was laid by Ramallah/Al-Bireh
 water company in the early fifties. Unfortunately, the pipes used
 did not meet the standard specifications. Generally, second hand
 pipes of only two inches in diameter were used. The network mostly
 constructed for individual consumers and not for complete streets
 or areas. The result of this lack of standards for network construction,
 is a complicated network that is extremely difficult and costly
 to maintain.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The present network in the main cities and villages
 consists of pipes connected in rings as a circulation system.
 By the end of 1995, the total length of the distribution network
 including all the different size of pipes was 749,426 meters.
 Table 5.7 shows the lengths and pipe sizes of pipes used in the
 network at the end of 1994 and 1995 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#20">JWU, 1995</a>).

<h3>Water losses</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Water losses were estimated by the JWU in 1994 at
 approximately 25%. The total water distributed by JWU was about
 7,555,811 m<sup>3</sup> whereas the sold water was 5,667,466 m<sup>3</sup>
 which means a loss of approximately 1,888,345 m<sup>3</sup> (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/refr.htm#20">JWU,
 1995</a>). The losses occurred through leaks in the main pipelines,
 the distribution network and the meters. It is also known that
 some water is taken illegally. No information is available from
 the WBWD about water losses in the network.

<h3>Conclusions and Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
 <li>The water status in the Ramallah District is
  very critical as the demand for water is high and expected to
  increase rapidly in the future. Ramallah and Al-Bireh cities are
  considered the commercial center for Palestinians, and therefore
  the demand on water will increase as investors choose to live
  and invest in Ramallah. 
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li>Water shares between Israel and Palestine should
  be reexamined as Israel pumps a great deal of water from Ramallah
  District. Their discharge is equal to the water consumed by the
  whole population in the District. This water is needed for development
  of the Palestinian agriculture, industry, economy and society.<b>
  </b>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li>Rehabilitating and building water collection
  and storage units to collect excess water, to regulate flow, facilitate
  spring use, and prevent waste of water. 
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li>Pumping of the Israeli Wells located at the Latroun
  in the southwestern part of Ramallah District near the no-man's
  land area, should be reduced to avoid further damage of the ground
  water system.
  </li>
</ul>
