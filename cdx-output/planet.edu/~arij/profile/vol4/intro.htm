 As the peace process between Palestinians and Israelis
 advances, and agreements are signed, several changes have taken
 place.  The Israeli military forces have pulled out fully from
 the major cities in the West Bank, including Ramallah and Al-Bireh
 cities and since then, January 1996, the Palestinian National
 Authority (PNA) has governed these areas.  After 28 years of Israeli
 occupation, there are many challenges facing the new authority
 in all areas of society.  During the Israeli occupation, much
 of the infrastructure of the West Bank was left unattended, development
 that did take place did not keep up with the rate of population
 growth.  Now, the PNA is working to rehabilitate the Palestinian
 infrastructure.  Several infrastructure projects have been initiated
 and many more are likely to be initiated in the near future. 
 These projects, coupled with the expected increase in economic
 activity and population pressure are likely to lead to widespread
 environmental pressures all over the West Bank.  In the building
 of a Palestinian government and administrative structures, legislation
 and regulations must be adopted to provide guidelines for development
 and to authorize power for enforcing these requirements.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Due to the fragility of the West Bank's ecosystem,
 it is necessary to prepare a framework for assessing and directing
 development in a sustainable manner.  Unless precautionary steps
 are taken, an unsustainable development pattern may emerge.  Environmental
 profiles are greatly important at this stage, for assessing the
 status of the environment and providing a background for a program
 to promote sustainable development.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Applied Research Institute-Jerusalem launched
 a two year project supported and financed by the Federal Government
 of Austria, Department for Development and Cooperation, through
 the Society of Austro-Arab Relations in Jerusalem (SAAR).  The
 aim of the project is to build an environmental database and produce
 a series of environmental profiles for each district in the West
 Bank.  The following environmental profile is the fourth in the
 series.  It describes the present status of the environment in
 the Ramallah District, and focuses on recommendations for environmental
 management programs required for the future.  This profile addresses
 issues related to the major components of the environment in the
 district.  It includes information supported with maps concerning
 the topography, climate, soil, geology, land use, water resources,
 agriculture, wastewater, solid waste collection and disposal,
 pesticide usage and air and noise pollution.  In addition, it
 covers the socio-economic situation and the existing historical
 and archeological sites existing in the Ramallah District.  Flora
 and fauna will be included in the comprehensive Environmental
 Profile of the West Bank.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Most of the information and data used in this profile
 are based on the primary field investigations and personal interviews
 conducted by the project team.  All maps included are produced
 by the GIS unit at ARIJ using ARC/Info and PAMAP software.
