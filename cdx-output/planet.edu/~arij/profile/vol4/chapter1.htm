<h3>Location And Land Use</h3>

<h4>Location
 </h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Ramallah District is located in the middle part of
 the West Bank.  For technical reasons, the definition of the boundaries
 of the Ramallah District used by ARIJ in this profile, as seen
 in <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/fig11.gif">Figure 1.1</a>, is a combination of the pre-1967 Jordanian
 administrative
 classification and the current Israeli designation of the boundaries.
 After the Israeli occupation in 1967, the Israeli government
 redefined the boundaries of Jerusalem and included 68.17 hectares
 from the Ramallah District as well as 1632.7 hectares from Bethlehem
 District.

 Accordingly, the Ramallah District, covered by this
 profile, extends from Jerusalem District in the south to Nablus
 District in the north and from Jericho District in the east to
 the 1948 cease-fire line between Israel and Jordan from the west
 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/fig12.gif">Figure 1.2</a>).

<h4>Land use
 </h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Land designations in the West Bank are defined by
 the recent "Oslo II" interim agreement and the functional
 land uses required for the Palestinian community, and the Israeli
 occupation control which continues today.  Land availability determines
 the Palestinians potential to sustainably develop the community.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The  "Oslo II" interim agreement between
 the Palestinians and Israelis, has divided the West Bank land
 into three areas, Area A, Area B, and Area C which are differentiated
 by a different level of control by the Palestinians.  According
 to these divisions, the populated Palestinian cities representing
 3% of the total area of the West Bank, is completely within the
 control of the Palestinians (Area A).  Area B which includes all
 the Palestinian villages and small towns cover 27% of the total
 area of the West Bank.  Palestinians now have full control over
 civil society except that Israel continues to have overriding
 responsibility for security.  Area C, which includes some Palestinian
 built up areas as well as Israeli settlements and military outposts,
 covers the remaining land.  Palestinians have responsibility for
 civil life in this area such as economics, health and education,
 however Israel retains control of security and power related to
 territory.  During the further redeployment phases, powers and
 responsibilities in Area C will be gradually transferred to the
 Palestinians, to be completed 18 months from the inauguration
 of the Palestinian Council.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 At this time, the Palestinian National Authority
 (PNA) has not been able to assume complete sovereignty on Palestinian
 land and the division of areas into A, B, and C hinders the potential
 of dealing with the Palestinian areas as a geographic integrity
 as an essential ingredient for sound environmental management.
 The final fate of Area C will be negotiated in the final status
 negotiation that began officially on May, 1996.<br>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Ramallah District measures approximately 84,362.1
 hectares.  This area is divided by the "Oslo II" interim
 agreement as follows:
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 "Area A", which includes the Ramallah and
 Al-Bireh cities in addition to Al-Ama'ri and Qaddura refugee camps,
 and covers 1,957.1 hectares (2.3%) of the district's land (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/fig13.gif">Figure
 1.3</a>).  Since January, 1996, the Israeli army has pulled out fully,
 and all responsibilities for internal security and public order
 are held by Palestinians.

 "Area B" is the populated villages, camps
 and the built-up area of the hamlets as shown in <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/fig13.gif">Figure 1.3</a>.
 It accounts for approximately 22,429.3 hectares (26.6% of the
 total area of Ramallah District).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 "Area C", which covers 71.1% of the district's
 land, includes areas of Israeli settlements, closed military areas,
 and military bases.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Functionally, there are eight major land use classes
 within the Ramallah District boundaries, serving both the Israelis
 and Palestinians.  These are Palestinian built­up areas,
 Israeli settlements, closed military areas and bases, nature reserves,
 forests, cultivated areas, and industrial areas (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/fig14.gif">Figure 1.4</a>).
 The Ramallah District occupies approximately 14.5% of the West
 Bank and 13.6% of Palestine (Gaza Strip and West Bank).  Currently,
 only 4.35% of the Ramallah District is inhabited by Palestinian
 built up areas, while approximately 20.3% is occupied by either
 Israeli settlements, nature reserves or closed military areas.

<h3>Palestinian Built-up Areas</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are 76 Palestinian built­up areas in the
 district.  Ramallah, Al-Bireh, Silwad, Bani Zeid, Bir Zeit, Deir
 Dibwan and Bitunia are the only communities designated as municipalities.
 Other built-up areas are governed either by village councils
 or village mukhtars.  In addition, there are four refugee camps,
 Al-Ama'ri, Qaddura, Al-Jalazone, and Deir A'mmar.  Due to the
 restrictions imposed by Israelis on giving building permits for
 the Palestinians, the Palestinian built-up areas are very limited
 and comprise only 4.35% of the Ramallah District area.  On average,
 the population density is reaching to more than 730 person/km<sup>2</sup>.
 Figure 1.5 shows the distribution and names of the various built
 up areas in the district.  These areas are mainly located on more
 than one soil association such as brown rendzinas and pale rendzinas
 soils, and terra rossa, brown rendzinas and pale rendzinas soils.
 These soil types constitute the most suitable land for agricultural
 purposes in the district.<br>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Israeli Settlements</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are 27 Israeli settlements in the Ramallah
 District, occupying approximately 1,438.5 hectares of the district's
 land (1.63% of the total district area).  Most of these settlements
 are located near the cease-fire line, to the west of the district.
 In 1992, it is estimated that at least 18,000 settlers are living
 in these settlements.  Giva't Ze'ev and Kokhav Ya'aqov settlements
 are located at the border between Ramallah and Jerusalem Districts.
 During the past two years, there was a gradual and progressive
 expansion in the Israeli settlements.

 and number of families for the settlements in Ramallah District
 and Figure 1.5 shows the distribution of these settlements.

<h3>Closed Military Areas and Bases</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Israeli army occupies approximately 10,725 hectares
 (12.7% of the total area) of the Ramallah District, claiming that
 these areas are important both as security zones and for military
 training purposes.  Furthermore, there are eight military bases,
 with a total area of about 235 hectares (0.28% of the total area).
 The closed military areas cover almost the entire eastern border
 while the military bases are distributed throughout the district.
 The closed military areas and bases are located on the following
 soil associations:<br>
 </p>
<ol>
 <li>Alluvial arid brown soil, on which irrigated
  crops can be grown;
  </li>
 <li>Brown lithosols and loessial arid brown soils,
  in which annual fieldcrops, mainly wheat and barley can be grown;
  </li>
 <li>Terra rossa, brown rendzinas and pale rendzinas,
  which are the most suitable soils for   agricultural purposes;
  </li>
 <li>Brown rendzinas and pale rendzinas, which are
  also suitable for agricultural purposes.
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Nature Reserves</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Israeli Authorities are used to declare a piece
 of land as a nature reserve in the West Bank in order to prevent
 the Palestinians from using this land for construction or agriculture.
 Experience has shown that land confiscated for being nature reserves
 became after a while an Israeli settlement.  There is a serious
 doubt about the true environmental significance of the currently
 declared nature reserves.  Currently, Israel had declared 15 nature
 reserves in Ramallah District with a total area of almost 4,724
 hectares ( 5.6% of  Ramallah District area), most of which are
 located within the Israeli-declared closed military areas.<br>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Forests</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are 6 forested areas in the district with a
 total area of about 308 hectares ( 0.36% of the total area ).
 Most of these forests are located on fertile soil types (terra
 rossas, brown rendzinas and pale rendzinas) and in areas of favorable
 climatic conditions for agriculture.  <br>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Cultivated Areas</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 During the 1993/94 growing season, cultivated areas
 in the Ramallah District covered approximately 23,831 hectares
 (28.2% of the total area)<b> (</b>Ramallah Agricultural department,
 1994).  Rainfed agriculture is dominant in the district, occupying
 approximately 23,737.7 hectares (99.6 % of the cultivated areas)
 while the rest is irrigated.  The agricultural areas are divided
 into the following:<br>
 </p>
<ol>
 <li><i> Fruit trees,</i> located mainly in the central
  mountains, occupying an area of approximately 18,959.6 hectares
  ( 79.7% of the total cultivated areas).  Olive trees are the dominant,
  occupying 15,186.64 of the area of fruit trees.  Fig trees are
  the next most common, covering an area of 1,170.7 hectares.  Grape
  trees, stone fruits and pome trees are also found in the district,
  they are grown on 811, 1,705 and 17.5 hectares respectively.
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Irrigated orchards of fruit trees are found on small
   amounts of land and in few villages.  Lemon trees cover the largest
   area (12 hectares), followed by other varieties such as pomegranate,
   orange, and guava.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
 </li>
 <li><i>Field crops and forages,</i> covering an area
  of 4,059.7 hectares (17% of the total cultivated area) in the
  1993/94 growing season.  Approximately 60% of the field crops
  and forages are grown in the eastern region of the district and
  the remaining 40% are distributed throughout the central and western
  regions.
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
 </li>
 <li><i>Vegetables </i>are located in the central and
  western regions of the district and covering an area of 791.7
  hectares for the rainfed and irrigated vegetables in the 1993/94
  growing season.  Tomatoes are the most common followed by squash
  and snake cucumber.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 <i><b>Roads</b></i>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Road network in the Ramallah district is in poor
 condition where it is not expanded or maintained for many years.
 There are 220.3 km of main roads and 250.1 km of secondary roads.
 These lengths include only the external roads that connect the
 cities with nearby villages until 1993.  Another road system is
 newly constructed by Israel within the West Bank area.  These
 by-pass roads are designed to link
 Israeli settlements within the West Bank with each other and with
 Israel.  These roads will be used only by Israeli settlers living
 in the West Bank.  The Israeli forces is confiscating thousands
 of hectares of Palestinian land for this purpose.  The by-pass
 roads are designed in a way that will hinder the future expansion
 of the Palestinian built-up areas and dividing Ramallah District
 into cantons (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/fig15.gif">Figure 1.5</a>).  The existing by-pass roads
 passing
 through Ramallah District have a total length of 64.7 km and the
 proposed by-pass roads are planned to include another 49.1 km
 (ARIJ, GIS unit).<br>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 <i><b>Industrial Areas</b></i>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are two industrial areas in Ramallah District,
 one is located to the south of Ramallah city and the other to
 the east of Al-Bireh.  Together they cover approximately 134.2
 hectares.
