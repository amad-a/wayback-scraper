<ol>
 <li>Lower Cretaceous Rocks
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   They are regarded as equivalent to the Pre-Aptian
   stage.  Their main composition consists of limestone, marl, shale
   and clay.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
 </li>
 <li>Upper and Middle Cretaceous Rocks
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   They are divided into the following formations:
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Kobar Formation:  It
    ranges in age from Aptian to Albian.  Outcrops exist in the west
    of Ramallah.  The formation consists mainly of brown ferruginous
    limestone, marl and sometimes of interbedded limestone.  The Albian
    rocks deposited with unconformity over the Aptian rocks.  Total
    thickness of this formation is approximately 180 m.
    <p align="JUSTIFY">
     &nbsp;</p>
   </li>
   <li>Lower Beit Kahil Formation:
    It forms the lower part of the lower Cenomanian.  It is composed
    mainly of thin bedded dolomitic limestone at the bottom which
    become massive towards the top. The total thickness is about 216
    m.
    <p align="JUSTIFY">
     &nbsp;</p>
   </li>
   <li>Upper Beit Kahil Formation:
    It forms the upper part of the lower Cenomanian.  The lower part
    of the formation consists of marly limestone with marly partings
    and of bedded limestone, somewhat dolomitic at the top.  The total
    thickness is around 180-205 m.
    <p align="JUSTIFY">
     &nbsp;</p>
   </li>
   <li>Yatta Formation:  It
    is the lower part of the middle Cenomanian.  The main composition
    of this formation consists of marl, limestone and chalk.  It has
    a thickness of about 110 m.
    <p align="JUSTIFY">
     &nbsp;</p>
   </li>
   <li>Hebron Formation: 
    It corresponds approximately to the upper part of the middle Cenomanian.
    The lower part of the formation consists of hard dolomitic limestone
    and dolomite.  While the upper part consists of dolomitic limestone.
    The total thickness is about 170 m.
    <p align="JUSTIFY">
     &nbsp;</p>
   </li>
   <li>Bethlehem Formation:
    It forms the upper Cenomanian.  It has the following lithological
    succession: well bedded cream-gray chalky limestone at the bottom,
    and recrystallized chalky limestone at the top.  It has a thickness
    of about 90-150 m.
    <p align="JUSTIFY">
     &nbsp;</p>
   </li>
   <li>Jerusalem Formation:
    It ranges from the upper Cenomanian to Turonian.  The lower part
    of the formation consists of massive limestone which is becoming
    more thinly bedded upwards.  The total thickness is about 75-130
    m.
    <p align="JUSTIFY">
     &nbsp;</p>
   </li>
   <li>Abu Dis Formation:
    It is composed mainly of chalk and cherts of Senonian age.  The
    chalk is usually white and in some parts of the formation takes
    the dark color due to the presence of bituminous materials.  The
    formation has a thickness of about 60-220 m.
    <p align="JUSTIFY">
     &nbsp;</p>
   </li>
   <li>Khan el Ahmar Formation:
    It extends from Maestrichtian to Danian stage.  Lithology and
    thickness vary greatly because of erosion.  Lithology changes
    from bituminous and phosphatic marl to variegated marl and soft
    limestone.  Total thickness is approximately 115 m.</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
 </li>
 <li>Quaternary Rocks
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   They are divided into the following formations:
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Lisan Formation: It
    consists mainly of thinly laminated marl with occasional limestone,
    marginally of gravel and poorly stored pebble beds.  The pebbles
    are sometimes siliceous or calcareous.
    <p align="JUSTIFY">
     &nbsp;</p>
   </li>
   <li>Nari Formation: It
    is well developed in the high rainfall areas.  Limestone forms
    the main composition of the formation.  It forms a thin coating
    over the limestone with a thickness of about 10-15  m.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Structural Pattern</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Ramallah District was affected by several tectonic
 movements which determined the general structure of the area.
 First, the compressive forces from northwest and southeast dominated,
 producing the main folds.  Second, the minor folds were formed,
 and finally, forces of shear dominated, producing the main faults.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Folding</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are many folds in the Ramallah area.  The most
 important one is the E'in Qinya anticline, which was formed by
 compressive forces from southeast and northwest.  It trends north-south.
 The general structure of the anticline is symmetrical, but near
 Biddu it becomes less or more symmetrical.  Between Beit Leqia
 and Beit U'r Al-Tihta, the western limb is steep, about 35<sup>o
 </sup>slope.  The western side of the anticline forms two minor
 folds trend northeast and southwest.  The eastern side also forms
 two pairs of syniclines trend northeast with the first begins
 north of Al-Bireh and dies near Deir Dibwan and the second passes
 through E'in Samia (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/fig41.gif">Figure 4.1</a>).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Faults</h4>
<br>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Most of the faults trend north-south and east-west.
 The northern part of the area, where the main faults exist, is
 more faulted than the southern part.  Majority of the faults extended
 for 5-6 km and have throws less than 50 m.  Large faults have
 throws of about (50-150)m, however, they are rarely in the area
 and die out over 1-2 km.  <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/fig41.gif">Figure 4.1</a> shows the distribution
 of
 faults and their directions.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Joints</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Joints are well developed in the dolomite and limestone
 especially in Lower Beit Kahil, Hebron and Bethlehem formations.
 Joints are often up to one meter wide at the surface.  Chalky
 and marly rocks are less affected with joints and solution channels
 than limestone and dolomite.  The presence of joints and karst
 caves make the formations good aquifers.<br>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Soils</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The soil classifications and references to major
 vegetation were adopted from the document entitled, <i>The Soil
 of Israel</i>, 1976.  The major soil associations found in the
 Ramallah District are as follows
 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol4/fig42.gif">Figure 4.2</a>):

 </div>
</center>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Grumusols</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 This type of soil association covers approximately
 817 hectares of the district.  It is found in areas with smooth
 to gently sloping topography.  The soil is originally formed from
 fine textured alluvial or aeolien sediments.  Primary natural
 vegetation was destroyed.  Today, what appears is segetal vegetation
 of the <i>Prosopis farcata - Scolymus maculatus</i> association.
 The use of this soil type for agricultural production purposes
 is currently limited to cultivating wheat.  The American great
 classification that represents this soil is<i>
 Xererts.
 </i>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Terra Rossa, Brown Rendzinas and Pale Rendzinas</h4>
<br>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 These types of soil associations occupy a total area
 of approximately 58,504 hectares, nearly 70% of the Ramallah District.
 Around 30­50% of these soils are outcropped with rocks.
 The major native vegetation cover are <i>Quercus calliprinos,
 Pistacia palaestina, Pistacia lentiscus, Pistacia atlantica, and
 Amygdalus korschinskii. </i> Particularly on valley shoulders,
 these soils are used to cultivate field crops, mainly wheat and
 barley, vineyards, olive and fruit trees.  The American great
 group classifications that represent these soil associations are
 <i> Xerochrepts and Haploxerolls</i>.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brown Rendzinas and Pale Rendzinas</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 These types of soil associations dominate the area
 of Deir A'mmar, Jammala, Al-Nabi Saleh, Beit Rima, Kafr Ni'ma,
 Beit U'r Al-Tihta, Beit Sira, Beit Leqia and Beit Nuba.  These
 soils cover an area of about 15,870 hectares.  Similar to the
 previous soil types, 30-50% of these soils are outcropped with
 rocks.  Major vegetation is <i>Pinus halepensis, Pistacia lentiscus,
 Pistacia palaestina, Quercus ithaburensis, Ceratonia siliqua </i>and<i>
 Ballotetalia undulatae</i>.  On such areas, cultivation of grapes
 and olives, field crops (wheat and barley), and grazing is the
 main land use, especially in shallow and steep sloping areas.
 The American great group classifications that represent these
 soil association are <i>Xerorthents, and Haploxerolls</i>.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brown Lithosols and Loessial Arid Brown Soils </h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 These types of soil associations cover an area of
 about 6,866 hectares of the Ramallah District.  These soils characterize
 the eastern slopes of the district and are mainly found on steep
 to moderate rocky and eroded slopes.  Brown lithosols are found
 in the pockets among the rocks.  Loessial arid brown soils are
 found on flat hilltops, plateau and foot­slopes.  The parent
 rocks of this soil association are chalk, marl, limestone and
 conglomerates.  Major vegetation is <i>Ballotetalia undulatae
 and Artemisietea herbae­albae</i>.  The American great classifications
 group that represent these soils are <i>Haploxeralfs Torriorthents
 </i>and<i> Xerochrepts</i>.    
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Loessial Arid Brown Soil</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 This type of soil association is found at the eastern
 border of the Ramallah District, covering an area of about 440
 hectares.  The soil is formed originally from conglomerate and/or
 chalk and mainly found on gently sloping plateau as well as dissected
 plateau with locally hilly topography.  The major vegetation type
 found in this region is <i>Achilleetum santolinae.</i> The dominant
 land use is cultivation of various field crops such as wheat,
 barely and sorghum which are grown as dry-farming crops and cultivation
 of some irrigated crops. The American great group classifications
 that represent this soil association are <i>Palexeralfs, Haploxeralfs
 </i>and <i>Xerochrepts.
 </i>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Alluvial Arid Brown Soil</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 This type of soil association is also located at
 the eastern border of the district.  It covers an area of about
 178 hectares.  It exists as alluvial fans and plains formed
 as a result of erosion of calcareous silty and clayey materials.
 This soil type supports Herbaceous vegetation of desert annual
 halophytes and glycophytes and responds well to irrigation, producing
 various crops, mainly subtropical and tropical fruits such as
 citrus, bananas, and dates, as well as winter vegetables. The
 American great group classifications that represent this soil
 association are <i>Haplargids </i>and Camborthids.
