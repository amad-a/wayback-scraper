<p align="JUSTIFY">Despite high temperature, evaporation, and low rainfall  (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/fig51.gif">Figure
 5.1</a>), the Jericho district is distinguished for its agricultural
 activities.  The success of agriculture in the area is related
 to the combination of its location below sea level, year-round
 warm weather and the availability of water (from springs and wells).

<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The warm winter temperature helps in cultivating vegetable crops
 which would not be possible during this season in other parts
 of Palestine, the Middle East and Europe.  Thus, agriculture in
 the Jericho district has a high economic potential both in the
 local and export markets.  Tropical crops are also possible, increasing
 the diversity of agriculture in Palestine.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Jericho district has three main agrarian regions: Jericho
 city, Dyouk and Nuwe'ma, and Al-Auja (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#28">Jericho Agricultural
 Station,
 1994</a>).  All plantations are irrigated from agricultural wells
 and springs located at the district.
 </p>
<h2>Plant Production</h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The area cultivated by Palestinians has not been expanded during
 the last 20 years due to the restrictions imposed by the Israeli
 occupation authorities on the land and amount of water permitted
 to be pumped from each agricultural well.

 In the 1993/94 growing season, the agricultural area in the district
 was approximately 2419.4 hectares (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#28">Jericho Agricultural
 station,
 1994</a>),  forming nearly 43% of the total irrigated agricultural
 area in the Palestinian part of the Jordan Valley and 23% of this
 area in the West Bank (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#43">SAAR, 1992</a>). Of the three agrarian

<h3>Vegetables</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 About 28 vegetable crops are grown throughout the Jericho district
 over an area of 1503.8 hectares and under different
 types of cropping systems.  This area is calculated on the basis
 of effective plantation per hectare.  Cropping systems are divided
 as: irrigated open field; low tunnels (crops grown under low plastic
 tunnels of 80 cm in height, usually used for early plantations
 to protect the crops from low temperatures during winter); medium
 and high tunnels (2-3.5 m in height); and plastic houses (more
 than 3.5 m in height) (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#28">Jericho Agricultural Station, 1994</a>).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Due to water resource limitations in the district, most vegetable
 crops are irrigated using drip systems.  Sprinklers and traditional
 flooding are also used in limited areas, especially in the basins
 cultivated with crops such as spinach, parsley and citrus. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The cropping season usually extends from September through June.
 During the rest of the year, land is being prepared for the coming
 season.  Obviously, this pattern varies depending on the cropping
 system, the crop, the needs of the land and the weather in a given
 year.  
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The planting dates in the Jericho district fall in two long periods,
 from September until January for early and winter cropping, and
 from February to April for summer cropping.  Farmers often plant
 some of the plots with short life cycle crops, so that they can
 cultivate a second summer crop, resulting in an increase in the
 effective cultivated area.  Recognizing the possibilities for
 increasing production through the intensification of agricultural
 techniques, farmers and business people have introduced modern
 technologies such as: plastic houses, high tunnels, low tunnels,
 plastic mulches, drip irrigation, improved varieties of plants
 and chemicals such as pesticides and hormones.  The combination
 of these have resulted in an increase in crop production, especially
 for prostrate varieties (i.e. cucumbers and tomatoes).  On the
 other hand, enlarging the vegetative cover per area has increased
 the water requirements where other alternatives of water resources
 should be found.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Of the total cultivated vegetables, tomato, squash, Jews mallow,
 cucumber, eggplant and sweet corn have the largest areas and production,
 comprising about 71.6% of the areas and 73.6% of production (see
 <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/fig53.gif">Figure 5.3</a>).
 </p>

   <i><a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/fig53.gif">Figure 5.3:  Total area and production of vegetable crops
   under different cropping systems in the Jericho district for the
   1993/94 growing season</a></i></p>
 </div>
</center>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Plastic houses and high tunnels cover up to 6.2 hectares, and
 are used to produce sweet and hot peppers, tomato, beans, cucumber,
 eggplant and Jews mallow.  Low plastic tunnels, occupying around
 161.2 hectares, and are used to plant the same types of vegetables
 planted in the open field irrigated areas, including all the 28
 vegetable crops.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The intensive irrigated vegetable production requires a continuous
 work during all stages of the growing season, providing more employment
 opportunities for the people.  Usually, farmers in the Jericho
 district tend not to own the land they cultivate but they always
 work through share-cropping or renting arrangements.  This is
 due both to the unpredictability of the produce market, making
 the farmers wary of investment in land, and also to the traditional
 land ownership arrangements.

<h3>Field crops and forages</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 All kinds of field crops and forages in the Jericho district are
 cultivated under irrigated conditions where sprinkler irrigation
 is commonly used.  High productivity is obtained from this cultivation,
 especially when compared with the same crops grown under rainfed
 conditions in other areas of the West Bank, especially the southern
 parts where there is limited annual rainfall. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Wheat and barley are the main cultivated field crops covering
 an area of 106.5 hectares in the Jericho district.  Green forages,
 such as alfalfa and Egyptian clover cover an area of      36 hectares,
 with an average production of 20 tons per hectare (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/fig54.gif">Figure
 5.4</a>).
 This area should be increased especially with forage varieties
 that can withstand salinity.  Increasing forage production will
 supply fodder to the livestock sector and reduce the dependency
 on Israeli green forages.  Most of these forages are also good
 for improving soil quality.

<h3>Fruit trees</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Seven different types of fruit trees are cultivated on an area
 of 771.1 hectares in the Jericho district with an average total
 production of 21,065.8 tons in the 1993/1994 growing season (see
 <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/fig55.gif">Figure 5.5</a>) (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#28">Jericho Agricultural

 </div>
</center>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Bananas have the largest cultivated area of all fruit trees comprising
 72.6%, and making up 79.8% of the total fruit production in weight.
 The banana is a profitable crop, both in terms of production
 and net revenue, but it requires large amounts of water, up to
 17,000 CM/yr/hectare.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are 6 cultivated types of citrus trees, totaling 17.8% of
 the fruit trees area and nearly 15.5% of fruit production (see
 <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/fig56.gif">Figure 5.6</a>).  Oranges have five different varieties (Joint,
 Valencia,
 local or Baladi, French, Shamoti), making up about 50% of the
 citrus area and 40% of its production.  Shamoti oranges and lemons
 cover the largest area of citrus and produce about 20 and 30 tons
 per hectare respectively.  However, the decrease in the economic
 value of citrus, especially for oranges, have led some farmers
 to cut down the citrus trees, replacing them with vegetables,
 and bananas.  The remaining 74.2 hectares of fruit trees are devoted
 to date palms (57 hectares), grapes, olives, and loquats (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/fig55.gif">Figure
 5.5</a>).

 Drip irrigation is the main system used for irrigating all types
 of orchards except for citrus trees.  Citrus are mainly irrigated
 through basins, which uses more water than other methods of irrigation.
 </p>
<h3>Crop Water Requirements </h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Crop water requirements vary from season to season depending on
 the amount of rainfall and planting date.  Low rainfall, high
 rates of evaporation, transpiration and radiation, low relative
 humidity and relatively high soil salinity in the Jericho district
 make the crop water requirements higher than other districts in
 the West Bank.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Calculating water requirements for different cultivated crops
 give a realistic estimation of the total water consumption for
 the cultivated area.  It also helps in projecting and planning
 the potential for the expansion of irrigated agriculture and modeling
 the types of crops to be grown, taking into consideration the
 amounts of available water and its sources.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are many factors controlling the water required by the plant
 through its life cycle such as: 
 </p>
<ol>
 <li>Climatic factors such as relative humidity, temperature, sunshine
  or radiation, rainfall and wind speed. 
  </li>
 <li>Soil factors such as the soil physical characteristics, water
  potential and hydraulic conductivity.
  </li>
 <li>Plant factors such as the planting date, growth stage, type,
  the size (coverage percent), the leaf orientation and the stomata
  numbers (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#32">Najem &amp; Badir, 1980</a>).
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The crop Zwater requirements based on water evaporation from the
 soil and transpiration of the plant are also calculated (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#14">Doneen
 &amp; Westcot, 1988</a>).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Several methods are used for calculating the crop water requirements.
 In this profile, the pan evaporation method was used to calculate
 the water requirement for different cultivated crops according
 to the cultivating period and cropping pattern (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#8">Water Data
 Base,
 ARIJ, 1995</a>).  Table 5.2 gives an estimate of the water requirements
 (evapotranspiration) based on estimates made using the pan evaporation
 method for different cultivated crops and cropping patterns in
 the Jericho district.  The average total amount of water used
 by all crops under different cropping patterns in the Jericho
 district during the 1993/94 growing season was, given evapotranspiration,
 18.42 MCM.  This amount did not include that needed to make up
 the losses due to soil or the irrigation system (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#7">Agricultural
 Data Base, ARIJ, 1995</a>).  Of all types of crops in the Jericho
 district, fruit trees have the largest crop water requirement
 with 63% of the total water use, followed by vegetables with 32.2%,
 and field crops with 4.8%.  Bananas alone consume approximately
 51% of the total amount of irrigation water. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Future plans for agricultural improvement in the district must
 take into consideration both water consumption and income per
 crop, so as to optimize the water consumption in the most economical
 manner.

<h3>Irrigation Ponds</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The irrigation pond is a water storage technique which allows
 for improving the  conservation and efficiency in water use in
 the agricultural water delivery. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The first irrigation pond was constructed in the 1970 as a demonstration
 at the Jericho agricultural station with a capacity of 1,650 CM
 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#28">Jericho Agricultural Station, 1994</a>).  The positive
 results achieved
 by this pond in increasing the productivity and improving the
 water use efficiency encouraged farmers to build these ponds and
 to use drip irrigation systems.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Soil irrigation ponds with plastic covers are most dominant in
 the Jericho district, with an average capacity of 3,403 CM/pond.
 Concrete irrigation ponds are less prominent and have a more
 limited capacity of just 300 CM/pond.  A total of 45 concrete
 ponds and 186 soil ponds are located in the Jordan Valley.   Of
 these, approximately 26 concrete ponds and 107 soil ponds are
 located in the Jericho district (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#28">Jericho Agricultural Station,
 1994 &amp;</a>; <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#1">Abed Al-Razaq &amp;</a>; 
 <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm">Abu Saleh, 1991</a>).  Most of these
 ponds were established between the years 1970 and 1980.  As shown
 in Figure 5.7, the rate pond construction in the Jericho district
 and Jordan Valley dropped in the 1980s (3.5 pond/year) and 1990s
 (1.3 pond/year) compared to the 1970s average of  6.1 pond/year
 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#1">Abed Al-Razaq &amp;</a>; <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm">Abu Saleh, 1991</a>).
 This is due to that in
 the 1981, the Israeli civil administration imposed constraints
 on building more ponds by requiring a license for each new irrigation
 pond.  This license has been rarely granted.  In addition to the
 high costs of construction and installation of an irrigation system
 using a pond.

 Most of the ponds in the Jordan Valley were designed and constructed
 by specialized engineers, reflecting the awareness of the Palestinian
 farmers about the importance of applying this technique in a proper
 manner.  Many factors affect the efficiency of this technology
 such as: pond location in the farm, natural slope of the land,
 location of the water resources, pond construction and plastic
 covering to prevent water seepage. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Irrigation ponds in the Jordan Valley get their water mainly from
 the springs.  Agricultural wells are used as well, and occasionally
 they are fed from the Mekorot, which is used as the last resort
 when other sources become dry, especially in the Al-Auja area
 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#1">Abed Al-Razaq &amp;</a>; <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm">Abu Saleh, 1991</a>).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Drip irrigation has been proven to increase water use efficiency
 by up to 90%. It is also known to increase agricultural productivity
 and solves the problems of water losses, which are often as high
 as 35% when traditional irrigation methods are used (especially
 furrow and contour furrow systems which use open canals) (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#1">Abd
 Al-Razaq &amp;</a>; <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm">Abu Saleh, 1991</a>). Also, drip irrigation
 has increased
 the average productivity of vegetable crops by 243%, citrus trees
 by 148% and banana trees by 125% (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#28">Jericho Agricultural Station,
 1994 &amp;</a>; <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#1">Abed Al-Razaq &amp;</a>; 
 <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm">Abu Saleh, 1991</a>).  More than 50%
 of the total cultivated area in the Jericho district are irrigated
 using these ponds.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Agricultural ponds and drip irrigation have played an important
 role in production improvement through the following factors:
 allowing better control of irrigation process and thus crop management;
 improving water use efficiency and at the same time reducing the
 time and effort needed for irrigation; allowing the possibility
 of improving water quality by mixing the saline water coming from
 agricultural wells with less saline water coming from springs,
 and thus increasing the size of cultivated areas; improving the
 planted area production; enhancing the summer crops cultivation
 during winter season; and increasing the farmers income.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Increasing the number of irrigation ponds will be one of the factors
 in improving plant production in the Jericho district.  Clearly
 this will involve alleviating the constraints on the installation
 of new ponds and finding sources of funding or credit for farmers.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 One promising prospect for this technology is to invest in aquacultural
 activities.  A recent study by Hosh showed that there is a potential
 to use these ponds for fish farming despite the fact that water
 quality is limited by many factors including high temperatures.
 Fish species which are suitable for the area such as, tilapia,
 carp and catfish, are available Besides increasing the income
 of farmers, this could improve the quality of irrigation water
 by supplying the water with nitrogen and phosphorus, and the production
 would help in improving the Palestinian animal protein intake
 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#20">Hosh, 1995</a>).

<h3>Livestock Production</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Because of the hot climate in the Jericho district, the design
 of the animal and poultry livestock farms is completely different
 from those in the high-lands.  Open shed system is the most prevalent
 in the area.
 </p>
<h4><b>Poultry:</b></h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are about 10-12 farms of broilers in the Jericho district,
 with an average capacity of 8,500 birds per farm per round.  Approximately
 4-5 rounds are reared during the year.  The number of broiler
 chickens produced was around 430,000 in 1994.  Layers are much
 less common than broilers due to their inability to produce well
 in high temperatures.  There is only one farm of layers in the
 Arab Development Society Project (ADS), with a total number of
 3,600 birds in 1994 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm">PARC &amp; Arab Thought Forum, 1994</a>).
 </p>
<h4>Sheep &amp; Goats:</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The numbers of sheep and goats in the Jericho district vary from
 one season to another.  Because of the district's warm winter
 and the availability of range plants for grazing, Bedouins (Palestinian
 nomad herders) graze their sheep and goats in the Valley from
 November until February, returning to the hills in the highlands
 in the remaining months of the year.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Local strains of sheep and goats are dominant in the district
 with a total number of 24,000 heads.  The majority of the sheep
 are Awasi while most of the goats are Baladi. There are  few improved
 strains such as Shami goats or Assaf sheep. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Like other livestock in the Jericho district, sheep and goats
 are facing problems associated  with hot climate.  The high temperature
 results in more water consumption per animal due to the increasing
 respiratory rates, which in turn affects the production and net
 profit.

<h4>Dairy cows:</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Approximately 451 dairy cows are reared in the district where
 almost 75% of these are at the ADS farm.  Ninety-five percent
 of these are Friesian and the rest are local dairy cows (Table
 5.3).  The average daily milk production for both strains is nearly
 15 Kg, which is 2.5 Kg/day below the average for the same strains
 elsewhere in the West Bank. This is due mainly to climatic conditions
 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm">PARC &amp; Arab Thought Forum, No.2, 1994</a>).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Beehives:</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are 7,540 beehives in the district, most of which are hybrid
 bees.  The annual production of honey reached 113 tons, with an
 average yield of 15 Kg of honey per hive (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm">PARC &amp; Arab Thought
 Forum, No.3, 1994</a>).

<h2>Agricultural Institutions</h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>1- Jericho Agricultural Station:</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 This station occupies an area of 8 hectares of which approximately
 4 hectares are planted with horticultural trees, such as bananas,
 date palms, and citrus.  The remaining area is usually used for
 vegetable production, especially for agricultural demonstrations
 and experiments.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The goal of the station is the improvement of agricultural activities
 and increase of of the  Jericho agricultural sector.  It is now
 operating under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture in
 the Palestinian Authority.  The office is staffed by agricultural
 engineers of different specialties working to rehabilitate the
 station's land and to provide services such as extension and research.
 Although the extension service and research are the main intended
 functions of this station, they have significantly deteriorated
 during the 27 years of occupation.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2- Arab Development Society Project (ADS):</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 This project was established in the mid-1940's by Mousa Al-Alami,
 on an area of 800 hectares.  The Israeli authorities confiscated
 around 300 hectares of the project area after occupation in 1967
 as most of this land was located in the Israeli declared military
 areas along the banks of Jordan River (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#9">ADS, 1992</a>).  The
 project
 aimed to achieve the following:
 </p>
<ul>
 <li>Improve the socio-economic conditions of the Arab farmers.
  </li>
 <li>Improve the agricultural industries.
  </li>
 <li>Encourage the agricultural cooperative system.
  </li>
 <li>Encourage the planting of all types of suitable trees. 
  </li>
 <li>Provide free agricultural and industrial training for poor
  people.
  </li>
 <li>Provide agricultural training on new technologies in agricultural
  production for  farmers. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The project includes the following sections:
 </p>
<ol>
 <li><i>cow farm:</i> There are approximately 300 heads of cattle,
  where approximately 117 of them produce 1.5-2.5 tons of raw milk
  daily.
  </li>
 <li><i>milk processing unit: </i>Usually operates as a training
  center for students about milk           processing to produce
  yogurt, labaneh and white cheese.
  </li>
 <li><i>poultry farm: </i>This section contains 3,600 layers and
  was established to train           students.
  </li>
 <li><i>Vocational Training Center: </i>The ADS runs a secondary
  school for boarding studentswhich provides certification for a
  Vocational Tawjehi in agricultural machinery,  carpentry and metal
  work. The association offers free lodging, food, clothes, medical
  care, and teaching.
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3- Jericho Agricultural Marketing Cooperative (JAMC):</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The JAMC was founded in the 1959 with the main goal of helping
 the Jordan Valley farmers to market their
 vegetable and fruit products and to protect them from losses caused
 by marketing crises.  With a current membership of 2,500 members,
 mostly farmers from the Jordan Valley, the cooperative has worked
 to find new markets outside the country to export excess production.
 Activities of the JAMC have included the following:
 </p>
<ol>
 <li>Helping to export agricultural products to Jordan and the Gulf
  markets.
  </li>
 <li>Providing permits and documentation so that agricultural products
  can be accepted by the Jordanian Authorities.  As part of this
  activity, the cooperative also compiled statistics of the annual
  cultivated areas and expected production in order to decide the
  volume of the exported vegetables and fruits (Jordanians often
  would allow imports based on estimated production and Jordanian
  absorption potential).  This activity has been ceased following
  the establishment of Palestinian autonomy over Jericho area .
  </li>
 <li>Distributing the money received from the PalestinianJordanian
  Joint Committeein order to provide support to Palestinian communities
  in the occupied territories throughout the 1980s.  For example,
  the cooperative used these funds to support the Palestinian farmers
  and to compensate them for crop loss due to frost damage in 1987.
  </li>
 <li>Initiation a farmstore in the Jericho district to provide farmers
  with agricultural equipment and chemicals at acceptable prices.
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4- Palestinian Agricultural Relief committee (PARC):</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 PARC is a Palestinian agricultural NGO operates through branch
 offices throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  One of the oldest
 branches is the Jericho branch, which was founded in the 1983.
 It carries out many activities such as:
 </p>
<h4>4.1  Plant production:</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The branch office contains a 40 hectares farm.  While most of
 this land was uncultivated when it was acquired, the area has
 been converted into viable farmland and is now used by PARC staff
 for plant production.  By the end of the 1994, approximately 7
 hectares were covered with plastic houses, including high tunnels.
 These houses will be used in the coming season.  Also, 5 hectares
 are cultivated with bananas and big part of the rest area is devoted
 to cultivating open irrigated vegetables.
 </p>
<h4>4.2 Training and extension programs:</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The farm is also used for training newly graduated agricultural
 engineers on the applications of the most modern of technologies
 in irrigated agriculture.  The training programs usually involve
 extension visits to farmers as well. 
 </p>
<h4><b>4.3 The women agricultural unit:</b></h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 This unit aims to improve the social status and standard of living
 of agricultural women.  It supplies funding to development projects
 that support women's activities especially at the domestic level.
 </p>
<h2>Major Problems and needs</h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In an attempt to improve the agricultural sector in the district
 of Jericho, many problems need to be addressed. These include:
 </p>
<ol>
 <li>Limited waer resources, in large part because of the restrictions
  on the amount of pumped water.
  </li>
 <li>Most of the spring's water is conveyed to irrigate lands through
  an open concrete or earthen channels.  This results in a very
  high water losses either through evaporation or seepage into the
  ground. 
  </li>
 <li> Water and soil salinity are continuously increasing due to
  the fact that soil leaching treatments are not often enough applied.
  </li>
 <li>Intensive agricultural techniques, while increasing short term
  production, have negatively affected the environment.  The intensive
  usage of pesticide, especially methyl bromide for soil fumigation,
  has had negative effects on humans, the environment in general,
  the ecological balance of soil profile and groundwater (see <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/chapter9.htm">Chapter
  9</a>).  Also, the increasing quantities of generated solid wastes
  resulting from the extensive usage of soil plastic mulches, tunnels
  and plastic houses have negative effects on the environment and
  livestock.  These covers are either left at the peripheries of
  the farm, leaving the risk that livestock might eat the plastic,
  possibly resulting in death, or burned on the farm causing air
  pollution.  Residues of plastic left in the fields may also hinder
  soil quality (see <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/chapter8.htm">Chapter 8</a>).
  </li>
 <li>Marketing crises due to lack of agricultural planning and controls.
  </li>
 <li>The ability to export produce is controlled by the continuously
  changing political situation, often causing heavy losses for
  farmers.
  </li>
 <li>Ineffective extension services which do not reach most of the
  farmers in the district.
  </li>
 <li>Directions of use on the pesticides and fertilizers containers
  is always written in either Hebrew or English language which is
  forming a problem for most of the farmers.
  </li>
 <li>The type of land tenure, where most of the lands are owned
  by wealthy holders of large areas, while farmers often work under
  share cropping arrangements.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Recommendations </h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The following recommendations may be important in contributing
 to the improvement of the agricultural activities in Jericho district:
 </p>
<ol>
 <li>Modern irrigation techniques should be introduced especially
  in citrus orchards.
  </li>
 <li>New crops of high potential productivity and profit should
  be introduced such as, flowers, prostrate tomatoes, certain salt-tolerant
  date palm varieties and grape varieties which mature early under
  plastic houses.
  </li>
 <li>Drainage systems like sub-surface lines should be applied to
  reduce land and water salinization.
  </li>
 <li>Effective plant rotations should be applied.  
  </li>
 <li>Suitable rules for protecting farmers and developing more
  fair systems of  land tenure should be put in place.
  </li>
 <li>An active extension and research system should be built to
  detect the farmer problems and find suitable solutions.
  </li>
 <li>Grading and storage centers for surplus production should
  be constructed to meet the international standards of marketing
  and exporting for agricultural commodities.
  </li>
 <li>New markets for exporting the surplus agricultural production
  should be opened.
  </li>
