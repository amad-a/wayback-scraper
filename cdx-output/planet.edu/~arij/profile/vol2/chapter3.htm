 The geology of Jericho district is characterized by the Jordan
 rift valley deposits which are mainly composed of Marl &amp; Pleistocene
 Alluvial formations.  The geologic formations in the Jericho district,
 as shown in the geological map (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/fig31.gif">Figure 3.1</a>), are:

<h4><font color="Black">I. Alluvium Formation:</font></h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="Black">
 This formation covers the area adjacent to the Jordan Valley starting
 by a width of 1 km in the north and 5 kms in the south.  It is
 of the Pleistocene to Recent in age.  It is bounded structurally
 by the Jordan rift regional fault in the east and another fault
 of 12 km long in the west. 
 </font></p>
<h4><font color="Black">II. Lisan &amp; Samra Formation:</font></h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="Black">
 This formation covers the greatest part of the Jericho district.
 It is of the Pleistocene to Recent age, and includes three local
 faults  of up to 3 kms long.  This area is bounded by the alluvium
 formation in the east and by a greater fault of about 13 kms long
 in the west.  It is mainly composed of marl, chalk and conglomerates.
 </font></p>
<h4><font color="Black">III. Chalk and Chert Formations:</font></h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="Black">
 These formations occupy the western part of the Jericho district.
 They are composed of the Senonian Chert and Chalk deposits and
 are covered structurally by minor faults.
 </font></p>
<h4><font color="Black">IV. Metamorphic rock formations of Senonian to Neogene
 ages:</font></h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="Black">
 These formations are composed mainly of calcium silicates.  They

<h4><font color="Black">V. Dolomitic Limestone Formation:</font></h4>

 This formation is composed mainly of limestone, dolomite and marl.
 It is of Cenomanian-Turonian in age, and occupies very small portions

<h2><b><font color="Black">Land use</font></b></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Jericho district has a total area of 35,330 hectares (353,300
 dunums).  Five major land use classes can be distinguished in
 the district.  These are Palestinian built-up areas, Israeli settlements,
 closed military areas and bases, nature reserves and cultivated
 areas (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/fig32.gif">Figure 3.2</a>).  Of the total area, the Palestinian
 and Israeli
 built up areas occupy approximately 1.7% and 1.5% respectively.

<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b><font color="Black">I.  Palestinian built-up areas</font></b></h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="Black">
 There are seven Palestinian built-up areas in the district.  The
 Jericho city is the only municipality in the district, while Dyouk
 El-Tahta, Dyouk El-Fuka, Nuwe'ma, Al-Auja are classified as villages.
 In addition there are Aqbat Jaber and Ein Al-Sultan refugee camps
 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/fig2.gif">Figure 2</a>).  These areas collectively account for approximately
 591 hectares.  The Palestinian built-up areas are located on either
 alluvial and brown soils, which are considered to be the most
 suitable soil for agricultural purposes in the district, or loessial
 serozems soils which are covered with pasture plants.
 </font></p>
<h4><font color="Black"><b>II. Israeli settlements</b>
 </font></h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="Black">
 There are 14 Israeli settlements in the district.  These are Gilgal,
 Netiv Hagedud, Niran, Yitav, Zori, Na'ma, Elisha', En Hogla, Bet
 Ha'erava, Lido Yehude, Atraqzia, Mizpe Yeriho, Vered Yeriho and
 Almog (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/fig2.gif">Figure 2</a>).  These settlements occupy approximately
 517.4
 hectares of land, and are located on different soil associations.
 Elisha', for example, is found on alluvial arid brown soils,
 which are considered to be the most suitable soil for agriculture
 in the district, while Atraqzia is found on Solonchalks, which
 is used for agricultural purposes if intensively managed.
 </font></p>
<h4><font color="Black"><b>III. Closed military areas and bases</b></font></h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="Black">
 Closed military areas take up approximately 5,844 hectares in
 the district.  The Israeli army claims these areas are of security
 importance and are used for military training purposes.  In addition,
 there are six military bases with a total area of approximately
 265 hectares.  These closed military areas and bases extend along
 the western border of the district and are located on the following
 soil associations:
 </font></p>
<ul>
 <li><font color="Black">Brown lithosols and loessial serozems, while not suitable
  for agricultural purposes, are important in terms of natural biodiversity
  and as a potential source for managed grazing.<br>

 <li><font color="Black">Brown lithosols and loessial arid brown soils, in which
  annual
  field crops, mainly wheat and barely, could be grown in these
  soils.
  </font></li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h4><font color="Black"><b>IV. Nature Reserves</b></font></h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="Black">
 Currently, there are four declared nature reserves in the Jericho
 district with a total area of about 1,965 hectares, mostly located
 within the declared closed military area in the district.  Because
 of the Israeli government's history of confiscating land through
 declaring an area 
 </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="Black">
 a nature reserve, there is suspicion about the true Israeli intentions
 and the environmental importance of the areas currently declared.
 </font></p>
<h4><font color="Black"><b>V. Cultivated Areas</b>
 </font></h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="Black">
 The culti</font>vated areas in the Jericho district cover approximately
 2419.4 hectares.  Due to the limited rainfall combined with the
 hot weather, irrigated agriculture is dominant in the district.
 The cultivated areas are concentrated in Jericho city, Dyouk,
 Nuwe'ma and Al-Auja including the following major types of cultivation
 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol2/refj.htm#28">Jericho Agricultural Station, 1994</a>): 
 </p>
<ol>
 <li>Fruit trees: The cultivated fruit trees occupy an area
  of 771.1 hectares.  Most dominant are bananas and citrus covering
  an area of 560 and 136.9 hectares respectively. 
  </li>
 <li>Field crops and Forages: The total area of the cultivated
  field crops and forages occupy approximately 144.5 hectares and
  include barley, wheat and sudan grass.
  </li>
 <li>Vegetables: The total cultivated area amounts approximately
  to 1,504 hectares, with 1,026 of the total area located at Jericho
  city and the rest distributed in Dyouk, Nuwe'ma and Al-Auja villages.
  For more information about cultivated areas see chapter five.

 It is exists of alluvial fans and plains, formed as a result
 of erosion of calcareous silty and clayey materials.  This soil
 type supports Herbaceous<i> </i>vegetation of desert annual halophytes
 and glycophytes and responds well to irrigation,<i> </i>producing
 various crops, mainly subtropical and tropical fruits, such as
 citrus, bananas, and dates, as well as winter vegetables.  The

 This type of soil association is found on moderate slopes to the
 west and northwest of the Jericho district, covering an area of
 about 1,290 hectares.  The soil is formed originally from conglomerate
 and/or chalk and mainly found on gently sloping plateaux as well
 as dissected plateaux with locally hilly topography.  The major
 vegetation type found in this region is <i>Achillea santolina,</i>
 and the main current land use consists of various field crops
 and some horticultural crops planted as irrigated crops.  Wheat,

 low plateaux and characterize large valleys and alluvial fans.
 The soil covers an area of approximately 800 hectares and it's
 parent materials are mainly of unconsolidated mixed stone and
 deposits.  The vegetation on this soil is restricted in a   few
 areas to rivulets.  In most areas dwarf shrubs such as <i>Anabasis

 mainly as a result of the flooding of the Jordan River.  This
 soil covers an area of about 2,400 hectares and  is originally
 formed from limestone, chalk and marl.  The vegetation it hosts
 is restricted to <i>Salsola vermiculata var vilosa</i> and its

 The soil parent rocks are recent alluvial deposits ranging in
 texture form sand to clay.  Its major vegetation cover is halophytic
 with species of <i>Tamarix, Suaeda, </i>and<i> Nitraria being
