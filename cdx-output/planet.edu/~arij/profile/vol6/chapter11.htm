<h3>The old city<br>

<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Old City, situated in the heart of East Jerusalem,
 was founded as early as 4000 BC.  The first impression you get
 when entering the city is its Middle Eastern appearance and architecture,
 with its narrow crowded streets and unique bazaars. <br>
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Old City is divided into four quarters, namely
 the Moslem, the Christian, the Jewish and the Armenian Quarter.
 The present walls surrounding the Old City were rebuilt by the
 Turkish Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in the 16th century, with
 a circumference of approximately 4 km and an average height of
 12 m ( <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol6/refj.htm#55">UNECEF &amp; Tamer, 1994</a>).<br>
