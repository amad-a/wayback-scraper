<h3>Historical Background
 </h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There is no exact dating for the beginning of the human settlements
 in Tulkarm City. Archeological findings reveal that an agglomeration
 has existed there at least since the Roman period.  It is believed
 that Tulkarm City was built on the ruins of the Roman village
 "Birat Soreqa", which means the well of the Mukhtar's
 vine.  Another explanation suggests that the name originated from
 the Aramaic word tur karma (Vineyard Hill).  This name
 was used by the Samaritan inhabitants of the Middle Ages and by
 the Crusaders.  The Islamic sources, based on Far'oun documents,
 show that early civilization was established in Tulkarm at the
 time of Canaanites.  In the 13<sup>th</sup> century and during
 the Mamluk's period, Daher Babers divided Tulkarm between two
 of his leaders.  Ibn Khaldon reported that the famous Ajnadeen
 Islamic battle occurred in Tulkarm which was formerly known as
 Ajnadeen.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Tulkarm district was established during the Ottoman period
 in 1892 and was called Bani Sa'ab district with Tulkarm City as
 its center.  In 1910, the Tulkarm district consisted of 44 villages
 and two cities, Tulkarm and Qalqiliya.  At the end of the British
 mandate, the Tulkarm district consisted of one city, Tulkarm City,
 and 70 villages including Qalqiliya.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Tulkarm strategic location between Nablus heights and coastal
 plains, gave the city a commercial and military importance.  Added
 to this, the two railway lines, which passed through the city,
 made it an important commercial station.  However, it had assumed
 the form of a small town that had been expanding with the increase
 in traffic passing through.  This development came to a halt in
 the 1930's, with the construction of the Petah Tiqva-Hadera highway
 which bypasses the town in the west and as a result of the Arab-Israeli
 war in 1948 when thousands of Palestinians were forced to evacuate
 their cities and moved to Tulkarm as refugees.  Tulkarm City was
 used as a base during the 1936-1939 Palestinian Revolution and
 by Iraqi soldiers during the 1967 war.
