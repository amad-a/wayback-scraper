<h3>Agriculture</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Tulkarm district is a semi-coastal
 region, located in the north-western part of the West Bank.  It
 lies between 40 to 500 meters above the mean sea level with 641
 mm average annual rainfall (Tulkarm Agricultural Department, 1995).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The district has good fertile soil,
 suitable climate, fair amount of good water quality for irrigation
 and relatively high annual rainfall.  These factors resulted in
 prosperous rainfed farming and irrigated agriculture in the district.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Agro-climatic Conditions
 </h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Considering the ecological map of
 the West Bank, Tulkarm district is located in two eco-zones. 
 The largest part of the district, including the Tulkarm and Qalqiliya
 cities, is located on semi-coastal region while a small part is
 located on the highlands but at a low elevation.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 It should be mentioned here that
 the geographical definition of the cultivated areas described
 in this chapter are according to the Israeli definition of the
 Tulkarm District and not as defined by ARIJ.  <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol8/fig1.gif">Figure</a> 1
 shows the
 Tulkarm district according to the Israeli definition where the
 Tulkarm district area is estimated at 62,000 ha, while <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol8/fig11.gif">Figure</a>
 1.1 shows the Tulkarm district as defined by ARIJ where the area
 is estimated at 33,453 ha (ARIJ GIS unit, 1996).   
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Depending on the kind of cultivating
 patterns, the Tulkarm district can be divided into two areas:
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. The Western Area (Semi-Coastal
 Strip)
 </h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 This strip extends along the western
 part of the West Bank, from Qaffin in the north to Qalqiliya City
 in the south.  The average annual rainfall ranges between 400
 and 700 mm.  Rainfed and irrigated fruit trees, wide areas of
 covered irrigated vegetable crops (plastic houses and low tunnels),
 open irrigated vegetables and limited areas of rainfed field crops
 and vegetables are planted in this part of the district.  This
 part also includes many of the agricultural villages such as Qaffin,
 Nazlat I'sa, Nazlat abu Nar, A'ttil, Deir El Ghusun, Dannaba,
 Tulkarm, Faro'un, Falame and Qalqiliya (See Map of the Tulkarm
 Build-up Area).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. The Eastern Area
 </h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 This area extends along the eastern
 parts of Tulkarm and Qalqiliya cities including Bala'a, A'nabta,
 Kafr El Labad and Beit Leed towns.  Water resources are limited
 in this area compared to the western area.  Rainfed field crops
 and olive trees are the dominant cultivation in this part of the
 district. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Plant Production
 </h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Various types of agricultural crops
 are planted in the district.  Warm temperatures and high rates
 of annual rainfall are the main factors contributing to the increased
 productivity and diversity of the planted crops.  For instance,
 27 various vegetable crops, 22 types of fruit trees and 12 types
 of field crops are grown through the district in 1993/94 growing
 season, covering an area of 36,511.9 ha.  Rainfed farming represents
 about 92% (33,577.4 ha) of the total cultivated area while the
 remaining 8% is irrigated.  The total plant production was approximately
 141,726.7 tons of which irrigated cultivation produces 74.5% of
 the total production and the remaining 25.5% is from rainfed farming
 (Tulkarm Agricultural Department, 1995) (See <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol8/fig61.gif">Figure</a> 6.1).

 Figure 6.1: Total
 Area and Production of Various Crops in the Tulkarm District for
 the 1993/94 Growing Season
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In the 1993/94 growing season, vegetable
 crops occupied the largest area, followed by fruit trees and field
 crops.  Fruit trees gave the highest amount of yield, followed
 by vegetable crops and field crops.  The average capacity of the
 plant production varies from 2.8 tons/ha for fruit trees to 2.0
 tons/ha for vegetable crops and 1.4 tons/ha for the field crops.
 The crucial factors resulted in increasing total capacity of
 production for various types of planted crops are the area of
 the irrigated lands and the level of technology being implemented.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Vegetable Crops
 </h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Throughout the Tulkarm district,
 vegetable crops occupy 45.3%  (2,794.8 ha) of the total cultivated
 area.  Irrigated vegetables occupy 1,427.3 ha with a total annual
 production of 52,850.1 tons while rainfed vegetables occupy approximately
 1,367.5 ha with a total annual production of 2,720 tons (See <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol8/fig62.gif">Figure</a>

 The area of irrigated vegetables
 is divided into open field vegetables (58%), plastic houses (32.1%),
 high tunnels (5.3%) and low tunnels (4.6%) ( See <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol8/fig63.gif">Figure</a>

 Figure 6.3:
 Distribution of the Cultivated Vegetable Crops and their Production
 under Various Cropping Systems in the Tulkarm District for the
 1993/94 Growing Season
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In general, the production potential
 of all vegetable crops increases significantly from 2.0 tons/ha
 in rainfed farming to 19.4 tons/ha in open field farming and to
 67.8 tons/ha in plastic houses.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Low tunnels are usually used either
 for protecting the planted seedlings from incidence of frost during
 the cold periods of winter where they are removed afterwards,
 or remain until fruit production is started.  In general, the
 potential of production under high tunnels is usually higher than
 that of low tunnels but in the case of the Tulkarm district both
 types of planting systems are used in limited areas and for limited
 crops (See <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol8/fig63.gif">Figure</a> 6.3).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Under plastic houses, cucumber is
 the dominant vegetable crop grown and occupies approximately 87.9%
 of the total area of plastic houses in the district.  This is
 followed by tomatoes, hot pepper, chilly pepper, jews mallow and
 eggplants.  The highest productivity obtained from eggplants was
 100 tons/ha and the lowest was for jews mallow (350 tons/ha).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Cucumber is the dominant crop planted
 under high tunnels.  It occupies 74% of the total area, followed
 by green beans and tomatoes.  The average capacity of production
 under high tunnels is half the productivity for the plastic houses,
 reaching 38 tons/ha for cucumber, 60 tons/ha for tomatoes and
 20 tons/ha for beans.  
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Eggplants occupy the largest area
 among the vegetable crops planted under low tunnels.  They occupy
 34% of the total area devoted for low tunnels, followed by green
 beans, cucumber, hot and chilly peppers and jews mallow.  The
 average productivity of planted crops under low tunnels is lower
 than that those under high tunnels and plastic houses for the
 same crops.  The highest productivity of eggplants was 90 tons/ha
 and 10 tons/ha for cucumber.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In the 1993/94 growing season,
 about 22 various vegetable crops were grown in open irrigated
 fields with a total area of 827.3 ha.  Cauliflower had the largest
 area (226 ha) followed by potatoes (201 ha), eggplants (48.7 ha)
 and cabbage (39.6 ha).  The average productivity varies between
 35 tons/ha for turnip to 10 tons/ha for cucumber, green beans,
 cowpeas, radish and parsley.       
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 For the same year, around fourteen
 types of vegetable crops were grown under rainfed conditions,
 occupying a total of 1,367.5 ha (49.9% of total vegetable area).
 Okra occupied the largest area (298.9 ha), followed by dry onions
 (211.9 ha), tomatoes (185.7 ha), garlic (121.9 ha), squash (124
 ha) and snake cucumber (98.9 ha).  The average productivity ranges
 between 2.7 tons/ha for potatoes and 0.4 ton/ha for both green
 beans and cowpeas (See <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol8/fif63.gif">Figure</a> 6.3). 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Fruit Trees</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In the 1993/94 growing season, approximately
 21 types of fruit trees were planted in the district on an area
 of 27,620.5 ha, with an average total production of 77,519.6 tons.
 Rianfed fruit trees are dominant with a total area of 26,151.3
 ha (94.7%) and  the remaining 5.3% were irrigated (See <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol8/fig64.gif">Figure</a>
 6.4).

 Figure 6.4: Total
 Area and Production of Fruit Trees in the Tulkarm District for

 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Olive trees are the dominant fruit
 trees planted in the Tulkarm district, holding 85% of the area
 devoted to fruit trees and 64.3% of the total cultivated area
 in the district.  This area includes 711 ha of unproductive olive
 trees, 22,757.3 ha of productive olive trees under rainfed conditions
 and only 7.5 ha under irrigation.  The average productivity of
 rainfed olive trees in 1993/94 growing season was 900 kg/ha compared
 to 3 tons/ha of the irrigated olive trees (Tulkarm Agricultural
 Department, 1995). 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Stonefruit trees are the next main
 fruit trees with a total area of 2,297.2 ha.  Almond trees occupy
 83% (1,905.7 ha) of this sector with an average production of
 300 kg/ha followed by apricots with an average production of 600
 kg/ha then plums with an average production of 500 kg/ha.  Peaches
 are the stonefruit trees grown under irrigation with a total area
 of 14.8 ha and average productivity of 2.5 tons/ha.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Irrigated fruit trees occupy 5.3%
 of the total fruit tree's area in the district and contribute
 by 67.8% of the total fruit tree's production.  Various types
 of fruit trees are irrigated including citrus (varieties of orange,
 clementine, lemon and mandarin), guava, peach and very limited
 areas of loquat, pecan, kiwi and avocado.  Citrus trees form a
 total area of 1,368.5 ha with a total production of 50,330 tons.
 Amongst the irrigated fruit trees, peaches have the lowest productivity
 of 2.5 tons/ha and both lemons and clementine have the highest
 productivity of 4 tons/ha.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In recent years, tropical trees have
 been introduced to the district offering a good economic opportunity
 for farmers to market fruits which are in great demand locally.
 Further expansion of the area planted with such trees should
 be carefully investigated in light of the high crop water requirment
 of these trees.  The remaining area of rainfed fruit trees consists
 of 278.7 ha of figs, 97.1 ha of grape vines, 22.5 ha of apples
 and pears and 30 ha of pomegranates.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Field Crops and Forages</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Field crops are totally cultivated
 under rainfed conditions, except for 38 ha of irrigated peanuts.
 Wheat has the largest area of 2,437 ha and a total production
 of 4,631 tons with an average productivity of 1.9 tons/ha.  This
 is followed by barley, which occupies 1,525.1 ha and produces
 3,050 tons.  Both crops form 65% of the total area devoted to
 field crops and forage and  to 88.9% of their production in the
 1993/94 growing season (See <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol8/fig65.gif">Figure</a> 6.5).  Food pulses,
 including
 dry broad beans, lentils and chickpeas, are planted in limited
 areas with an average productivity of 400 kg/ha.

 Figure 6.5:
 Total Area and Production of Various Field Crops and Forages in
 the Tulkarm District for 1993/94 Growing Season
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Wheat production in the Tulkarm district
 accounts for nearly 15.7% and 26% of both total cultivated area
 and production in the West Bank, respectively.  Tulkarm district
 ranks the first in wheat production followed by Jenin (19.2%),
 Hebron (18.25%), Ramallah (15.2%), and Nablus (12.7%).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The total area of seed forages comprises
 529.4 ha of bitter vetch and 426.4 ha of common vetch, with an
 average productivity of 400 kg/ha.  Sesame is usually planted
 in the district as a summer field crop.  In the 1993/94 growing
 season, 313.6 ha of sesame were planted with an average productivity
 of 350 kg/ha.  Some medicinal crops are cultivated on a limited
 area, such as dill, nigella and fenugreek, with an average productivity
 of 400 kg/ha. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Land Tenure and Farm
 Size
 </h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There is excessive fragmentation
 of land holdings in the Tulkarm district as a result of the traditional
 inheritance laws. Approximately 85% of the holdings have areas
 between 0.1 and 2 ha.  These small holdings provide insufficient
 income to the farmers, who are forced to look for additional sources
 of income.  Table 6.1 shows the distribution of holding size in
 irrigated lands in the Tulkarm district.  These results are based
 on a survey carried out by ARIJ (1994-1995).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Approximately 51% of the total irrigated
 lands are rented, 40% are planted by the owners, and 9% are shared
 (ARIJ - Water Data Base, 1995).  Renting and sharing systems are
 done in the following patterns:
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Sharing system</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In addition to providing land and
 water, landlords provide 50% of all other production inputs while
 the partners provide the other 50% and labor costs.  
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cash rent</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 It is the most dominant system for
 intensive plantations of vegetable crops in the district.  The
 rent is around $ 700 per hectare per year.  In this system, landlords
 provide nothing for production input.   Most of the farmers pay
 the money of rent at the beginning of the growing season.

<h3>Irrigation Practices</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 New techniques of irrigation such
 as sprinkler and drip irrigation are adopted in 65.5% of the total
 irrigated lands in the district while 34.5% are irrigated by traditional
 methods such as: furrows and basins (ARIJ - Water Data Base, 1995).
 Approximately all of the irrigated vegetable crops in the district
 are irrigated by modern irrigation techniques (90% drip and 10%
 sprinkler). 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Of the total area of irrigated fruit
 trees, 31% are irrigated by modern irrigation techniques and the
 remaining 69% irrigated by furrows and basins especially in citrus
 orchards.  Table 6.2 shows the distribution of irrigated areas
 under various irrigation methods in the Tulkarm district.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Modern irrigation methods need to
 be introduced into the fruit trees' orchards especially for citrus
 where large amount of water is lost.  Such adaptation will serve
 25-30% of the water used for irrigation, providing an economic
 benefit for farmer as well as enable further expansion of irrigated
 areas.

<h4>Crop Water Requirements</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 ARIJ has conducted an evaluation
 of the crop water requirement for the various irrigated crops
 in the West Bank districts as part of the Irrigation Management
 Project which is funded by the Canadian IDRC and conducted by
 the water research unit at ARIJ.  A full report is expected soon
 but highlights of the findings for Tulkarm district will be presentd
 here.  The Penman method has been used in estimating crop water
 requirements, taking into account the climatic (adapted from Tulkarm
 Weather Station), soil and plant factors.  Table 6.3 gives an
 estimation of water requirements for the main cultivated crops
 in the open field and plastic houses in the Tulkarm district.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In order to determine the actual
 quantity of irrigation water required by the various irrigated
 crops and cropping systems, several factors should be taken into
 account such as the amount of effective rainfall, irrigation method
 efficiency, soil texture and salinity, water required for some
 agricultural practices such as soil fumigation and water quality
 parameters including salinity, chloride and sodium content, etc.

<h3>Forests </h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Approximately 18,100 ha of natural
 and human-made forests exist in the Tulkarm district.  Natural
 forests seize approximately 43.1% of the total forest areas while
 13.8% are man-made forests, and the remaining 43.1% are considered
 as unplanteor deforested land. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Calcotome villosa, Pistacia lentiscus
 and Ceratonia siliqua are the most dominant and well-known
 species of forest trees in natural forests.  Allepo pine (Pinus
 halepensis) is the most dominant forest tree in the human-made
 forests, followed by cypress trees and Cupressus spp. 
 These areas need maintenance and development through replanting
 deforested areas with suitable species of forest trees (Tulkarm
 Agricultural Department, 1995).   
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Pesticide usage in the Tulkarm
 district
 </h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Approximately 58.8 tons of pesticide
 were used in the Tulkarm district in the 1993/94 growing season.
 The total area treated with pesticides was 9,190.3 ha (25% of
 the total cultivated area in the district), of which 59.4% was
 cultivated with fruit trees, 22% with vegetables and 18.4% with
 field crops.  The total treated area of rainfed farming was about
 6,425 ha and required 17.6 tons of pesticides, while 2,765.3 ha
 of irrigated lands were treated with 41.2 tons of pesticides.

<h3>Livestock, poultry and

 </h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cattle</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are 816 heads of the local
 cattle breed and 679 head of the Frisian breed in the Tulkarm
 district, together representing about 12.7% of the total number
 of cattle in the West Bank.  <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol8/fig67.gif">Figure</a> 6.7 shows the distribution
 of both breeds of cattle according to age and sex.  The number
 of milk-producing cows from both breeds forms 71.6% of total cattle
 in the district, followed by the heifers (16.5%), calves (10.6%)
 and bulls (1.3%).  The main target of rearing cattle is for  milk
 production.  Hence, the number of females forms 88.2% of the total
 number of the cattle in the district.   Moreover, the strongest
 and most healthy bulls and calves are usually selected for studding
 and the rest are usually raised for meat production.  Around 37%
 of the cows are inseminated naturally while the rest are inseminated
 artificially (Tulkarm Agricultural Department, 1995).

<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Figure 6.7:
 Number of Cattle in the Tulkarm District According to Sex and
 Rearing Stage for 1994
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The average daily production of milk
 ranges between 27.6 liters for the Frisian cows and 4.7 liters
 for the local breed.  Also there are hybrid cows resulting from
 crossing between both breeds, giving an average productivity of
 15.5 liters per day each.  According to the milking method, 86%
 of producing cows are milked manually while 14% are milked by
 milking machines.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Nearly 45% of total daily produced
 milk is consumed as fresh milk while the rest (55%) processed
 into various milk products as follows: 53% for cheese, 46% for
 yogurt and 2.0% for producing sour cream (labaneh).  About 16%
 of fresh milk and milk products are sold in the locations of production
 and 84% in the markets of the district.  The women farmers are
 usually responsible for processing the produced milk manually
 at their homes (ARIJ Data base, 1995, PARC and Arab Thought Forum
 1994, Vol.2, No.2).   
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Sheep and Goats</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are approximately 29,235 sheep
 and goats in the district.  Sheep form about 61% of the total
 number of the small ruminants including 16,364 heads of local
 breed and 1,460 heads of the Assaf breed.  The number of goats
 is smaller than that of sheep and forms only 39% of the total
 small ruminants.  Most of the goats in the district are of  local
 breed and few are Shami and hybrid goats.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The distribution of sheep and goats
 according to the grazing months during the year shows that 1.8%
 are totally fed on concentrates (confined system), 3.3% are mostly
 dependent on the range lands and 79.4% graze and supplemented
 with concentrates (PARC and Arab Thought Forum 1993, Vol. 1, No.
 6.).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Poultry</h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are approximately 480 farms
 of broilers in the Tulkarm district.  The number of broiler chicken
 produced in the Tulkarm district was 3.5 millions in 1994 (Tulkarm
 Agricultural Department, 1995).   Moreover, there are approximately
 160 layer chicken farms with a total number of laying hens of
 137,000, of which 67% are egg producers (PARC and Arab Thought
 Forum 1994, Vol.2, No.2).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Apiculture
 </h4>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are about 3,000 modern beehives
 in the district, forming about 14.7% of the total number of beehives
 in the West Bank.   Approximately 22.2% of total number of the
 bee- hives contain local breeds, 29.8% are of Italian breed and
 48% are of hybrid breeds.  The average capacity of annual production
 for local, Italian and hybrid breeds is estimated at 7.5 kg, 21.2
 kg and 15.9 kg of honey per year respectively.  The average total
 production in 1994 was 46.8 tons of honey.   
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Approximately 93.2% of existing beehives
 are extracted using electric extractors. About 9.3% of the total
 produced honey is exported to the Israeli markets, either directly
 and/or through marketing agents, and the rest is sold locally
 in the markets of  the West Bank and Gaza Strip (PARC and Arab
 Thought Forum, 1994, Vol. 2, No. 3).

 &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 1. About 29% of total irrigated area
 in the West Bank is located in the Tulkarm district, therefore,
 the development of all inputs of plant production is required
 to improve this sector in this district.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 2. Introduce and increase the cultivated
 areas with high quality crops to compete in local and outside
 markets. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 3. Start new activities and encourage
 investment in the agricultural sector to attract both agricultural
 workers and business people.  Establishing new projects such as
 grading and storage centers, exporting and introducing new methods
 of cultivation are essentials.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 4. Establish food factories and develop
 the Palestinian agro-industry.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 5. Improve extension activities in
 order to develop farmer's experience, mainly in management and
 crop types.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 6. Protect farmers and products during
 marketing crisis.
