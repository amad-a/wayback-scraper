  <h2>Demography and Population</h2>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The total area of Nablus district was approximately
   2,474 km2 before 1967.  In the year 1944, the total population
   of Nablus district was around 89,200 persons (Palestinian Statistical
   Abstract, 1984/86), later in the early 1960s, the total population
   reached 170,000 persons (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#14">Encyclopedia Palaestina, 1984</a>).
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   According to official Palestinian statistics the
   estimated total population of Nablus district is 333,295 in 1994
   including the four refugee camps: Balata, Askar, Ein Beit El Ma'
   and Far'a (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#34">PCBS, 1994 and UNRWA, 1994</a>).
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The population of the rural areas is approximately
   182,463 representing 54.7% of the total population.  The population
   of the four refugee camps is approximately 37,846 representing
   11.4% of the total population.  The population of urban and semi-urban
   areas is 112,986 representing 33.9% of the total population of
   Nablus district (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#34">PCBS, 1994 and UNRWA, 1994</a>).
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Nablus city is the only city in the West Bank where
   one can find the congregation of the three  religions, Moslems,
   Christians and Samaritans live together.  The Samaritans live
   in the south-western part of Nablus city.  There are approximately
   400 Samaritans living close to Nablus, 60% of them are below the
   age of 20 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm">Al-Awda, 1995</a>).  Over the years, the Samaritans
   have
   come to live as part of the Palestinian society.  The Palestinian
   leadership recognized their rights to vote and to represent themselves
   in the Palestinian Legislative Council by assigning them one permanent
   seat in the council.

  <h3>Population Density</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The population density of Palestine varies greatly
   between areas.  The district of Nablus has a population density
   of approximately 211 people/km<sup>2</sup>.  In Nablus district,
   at least 70% of the land is still controlled by Israel and Palestinians
   are not allowed to live there.  Therefore, in reality the population
   density is more like 700 people/km<sup>2. 
   </sup>
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Economics
   </h2>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Most of the economic assets of the West Bank are
   concentrated in Nablus city.  What distinguishes Nablus city from
   the other Palestinian cities is the type of land ownership.  There
   are many families who held large tracts of land, while land is
   fragmented into small pieces in the other cities.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Major industrial activities in Nablus district include
   aggregate quarrying, stone and marble cutting and a wide range
   of manufacturing and processing industries.  Processing and manufacturing
   industries include food products, clothing, leather products,
   furniture, printing, workshop fabrication, mixed concrete, terrazzo
   tiles and cement blocks.  These industries are found in Nablus
   municipal industrial zones (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#10">Center for Engineering and Planning,
   1993</a>).
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The unemployment rate in Nablus district for 1994
   was approximately 23%.  Due to the Israeli continuous closure
   of the West Bank and the limited opportunities for employment
   in the West Bank, the unemployment has increased significantly.
   Approximately 60% of the employed persons have permanent job,
   20% have seasonal jobs and 20% have part-time jobs (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#2">PARC
   &amp; Arab Thought Forum, 1994</a>).
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Infrastructural Services
   </h2>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The level and extent of infrastructure in the region
   vary between urban and rural areas.  Nablus city and other secondary
   urban centers generally enjoy open access to internal road networks,
   relatively sufficient water and electrical power supply, and adequate
   municipal services such as waste collection and disposal.  However,
   a large proportion of villages in the region suffers from lack
   of adequate infrastructure, particularly in the areas of sanitation
   and sewage, water distribution and regular  electric power supply.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The district contains a large number of charitable
   and non-governmental organizations that fill the gaps in services
   that the formal institutions are yet unable to provide. Appendix
   1 shows the major associations and institutions in the district.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Sewage Disposal Facilities</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   According to the survey which was conducted by ARIJ
   in November 1995, the wastewater network covers only 38% of Nablus
   district.  Almost 70% of Nablus city is served by the sewage network.
   The remaining parts of the city use cesspits to dispose their
   wastewater, or simply drain the wastewater in the nearby wadis.
   Open sewerage channels are usually used in the refugee camps.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Piped Water Supplies</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Approximately 75% of the population in Nablus district
   receive piped water supply.  However, water supply is irregular
   and the network suffers from frequent dry periods which sometimes,
   especially during summer, last for several days or even months.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Solid Waste Disposal Services</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The disposal of solid waste and its management is
   a crucial problem that is of great concern to the local authorities.
   Nearly 61.4% of the solid waste is collected in Nablus district,
   while 38.6% of the garbage is dumped randomly on the road sides,
   backyards and in the open spaces in the rest of the district.
   The Nablus municipality is responsible for collecting 23% of
   the garbage, while 22% of the solid waste is collected by the
   village council.  Solid waste collection in the refugee camps
   is administered by  UNRWA.  Around 14% of the solid waste in Nablus
   district is collected by the UNRWA.  The remaining 2.4% of the
   garbage is collected by several cooperatives in the district.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Electricity Services</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   In 1957, the Nablus Municipality Electricity Undertaking
   (NMEU) was established by the Municipality of Nablus.  Due to
   the obsolescence of old generating units and inadequate maintenance
   of the new units, the NMEU is supplied by the Israeli Electric
   Cooperation (IEC) through two link-up points.  One point is in
   the vicinity of the town of Anabta, while the second is near Askar
   refugee camp (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#10">Center for Engineering and Planning, 1993</a>).
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Nablus, Anabta, Beit Eiba, Zawata, Talloza, Askar,
   Balata Tell, Jeneid, Kafr Qallil, E'inabous, Quza and Huwwara
   are the only sites which are supplied by electricity through the
   NMEU.  Other towns and villages in Nablus district which are not
   connected to the NMEU network are either supplied directly from
   the transmission lines serving the Israeli settlements in the
   region, or depend on local generators for providing minimal domestic
   requirements of electricity during a limited number of hours each
   day.  These local generators are usually owned and operated by
   local village committees and cooperatives, or by private groups
   and individuals (Center for Engineering and Planning, 1993). 
   Most of the electricity used in Nablus district is imported from
   Israel, this amount represent 108.8 GWH/y, while those generated
   is only 25.2 GWH/y.  According to 1995 index, the price of electricity
   in Nablus district was 0.51 NIS/KWh which is the highest price
   of electricity in the West Bank (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#36">PERC, 1995</a>).
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Transportation and Communication
   </h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Nablus district is located on the major north-south
   road.  From Nablus the road leads to the northern part of Palestine
   and the southern part through Jerusalem.  The road system in Nablus
   district, as in the other districts of the West Bank, is divided
   into two categories, those mostly for Palestinian use and the
   others for the Israeli settlers living in the district.  For the
   most part, the Palestinian road system has not been expanded or
   repaired for many years and is mainly classified into three main
   categories: paved roads with two or more lanes, single lane paved
   roads, and dirt roads.  There are 365.8 km of main roads and 313.2
   km of secondary roads that connect Nablus city with its nearby
   villages. 
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   After the signing of the Oslo agreement, new road
   system was established to connect the settlements throughout the
   West Bank.  Confiscation of thousands of hectares of Palestinian
   land was the negative consequence of this process.  The new bypass
   roads have a total length of 39.699 km (until March 1996) and
   proposed bypass roads are expected to include another 73.0 km.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h2>The Health Sector in Nablus District</h2>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Since the onset of Israeli occupation, the Israeli
   military authorities have implemented policies that neglected
   the existing governmental health services and led to the disintegration
   of health-care infrastructure in Palestine.  The natural development
   of this sector was impeded by tight restrictions, including the
   denial of funds, the blocking of further development and the linkage
   of health-care institutions to their Israeli counterparts.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   On 13 September 1993, a declaration of principles
   was signed by the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and
   the Israeli Government.  As stipulated by this agreement, a transfer
   of authority took place from the Israeli Military Government and
   its civil administration to the authorized Palestinians.  One
   of the areas that was transferred to the Palestinian authorities
   is the health sector.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Health care services are provided by the three main
   operators in the Palestine: 
   </p>
  <ol>
   <li>The public sector - The current organization
    of the public health care is similar to the previous situation
    with the important and fundamental exception, that the responsibility
    now lies on the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
    </li>
   <li>UNRWAS's health department - mainly towards refugees.
    </li>
   <li>Non-Governmental sector - involving local and
    international charitable organization, non-governmental organizations
    (NGOs) and private entrepreneurs.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Both the level and extent of health services need
   substantial improvements in order for the Palestinian to attain
   an acceptable level of health and enable them to participate fully
   and effectively in socio-economic development and reconstruction.
   </p>
  <h3>
   </h3>
  <h3>Primary Health Care Clinics</h3>
  The primary health care in Palestine operates by public health
  offices.  These offices supervise and are responsible for the
  preventive health services in the urban and rural areas.  There
  are 53 primary health care clinics in Nablus district, which are
  distributed as follows: 19 clinics are operated by NGO's; 30 clinics
  are run by public sector; and UNRWA operates 4 clinics for the
  refugees (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#35">PCH, 1994</a>).
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Hospitals</h3>
  There
  are four hospitals in Nablus district.  Two are public hospitals
  with a total of 208 beds.  The other two hospitals are operated
  by NGO's and have a total of 157 beds (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#35">PCH, 1994</a>). 
  There are
  four rehabilitation centers, one for motor rehabilitation, one
  for vision impaired, one for hearing disabilities and one for
  mental disabilities (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/35">PCH, 1994</a>).
  <h3>
   </h3>
  <h3>Medical and Health-Care Personnel</h3>
  Nablus district possesses the highest rate of medical and health-care
  personnel among all the districts of the West Bank.  The total
  number of human health resources in Nablus district is as follows.
  <ul>
   <li>282 physicians, representing 23.9% of the total
    physicians in Palestine (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#25">Medical Associations, 1996</a>).
    </li>
   <li>331 nurses, representing 15% of the total number
    of nurses in Palestine (PRC, 1993).
    </li>
   <li>93 dentists representing 22.1% of the total dentists
    in Palestine (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#25">Medical Associations, 1996</a>).
    </li>
   <li>170 technicians representing 14% of the total
    number of technicians in Palestine (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm">PRC, 1993</a>).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h2>The Education Sector in Nablus District</h2>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The education sector in Palestine has traditionally
   been subjected to numerous conflicting external factors.  The
   early formulation of the present school system was established
   during the British mandate period.  Since the end of the mandate
   period, and due to the political situation in the region, the
   Palestinian people have been deprived of their right to freely
   develop their education and culture.  Between 1948 and 1967, the
   education received by the majority of the Palestinians in the
   West bank was influenced greatly by the Jordanian System.  After
   1967, the West Bank education system was altered and limited by
   the Israeli occupiers.  In 1994, Palestine got, for the first
   time in the history, the right to define its educational curriculum.
   The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provided
   education services to the Palestinian refugees in Palestine and
   other Arab countries, formulated its own education system and
   structure.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   In 1944, there were 9 government schools in Nablus
   district.  By the school year 1966/67 the number of schools had
   grown to 29.  The district had 3 private schools in 1944 and by
   1966/67 the number reached to 16 private schools (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#14">Encyclopedia
   Palaestina, 1984</a>).
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Literacy rates of all the Palestinians are lowest
   among females in the West Bank, where 32% of women report that
   they are not able to write and only 8% of the men cannot write
   (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#15">FAFO,  1993</a>)
   </p>
  <h3>

  <h3>Pre-School Education (Kindergarten)
   </h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   There are approximately 71 kindergartens in Nablus
   district, all of which are supervised by the private sector. 
   Around 5691 pupils are found in all kindergartens, 52% are males
   and 48% are females (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#34">PCBS, 1995</a>).

  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h3>General Education
   </h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   According to the 1994/95 Palestinian statistics,
   there are now 245 schools in Nablus district, 136 are basic, 38
   are secondary and the remaining 71 are kindergartens (PCBS, 1995).
   Around 148 schools are administered by the government, 16 by
   UNRWA, and the remaining 81 schools are owned and administered
   by the private sector (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#34">PCBS, 1995</a>).
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The total enrollment in all schools is estimated
   to be nearly 59,957 students.  The number of students studying
   in the community colleges is around 661 pupils (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#34">PCBS, 1995</a>).
