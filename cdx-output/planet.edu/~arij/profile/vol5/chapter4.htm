   Rock outcrops in Nablus area range in age from Cretaceous
   to Quaternery. Jurassic rocks also have limited outcrops. Cretaceous
   and Tertiary rocks are marked by marine carbonate sediments such
   as limestone, dolomites, chalks and marls (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#40">Rofe and Raffety,

  <h2>Geological Formations</h2>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h3>1- Jurassic Rocks:</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   They are exposed in wadi Maleh, and composed mainly
   of limestone. Jurassic rocks are divided into the following formations
   (Table 4.1)
   </p>
  <ul>
   <li><i>Lower Maleh formation:</i>
    It consists mainly of limestone which is affected by instrustive
    basalt. The limestone is massive and it has a light-brown color
    which is due to limonate. The formation is marked with vertical
    joints.
    </li>
   <li><i>Upper Maleh Formation:</i>
    The lower part of this formation is marked with marl and chalky
    limestone, while chalk and chalky limestone mark the upper part.
    The limestone of the lower formation is suddenly transformed from
    massive to a sharp topographic feature. Weathered limestone and
    Karst caves make the formation a minor aquifer.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h3>2- Cretaceous Rocks:</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   They are divided into the following formations: 
   </p>
  <ul>
   <li><i>Ramali Formation:</i>
    The Ramali Formation, in Nablus area, consists of sandstone series
    occurring between the base of the Beit Kahil and the Maleh formations.
    The Ramali formation is exposed in the core of the Judean anticline
    in three distinct areas. The most extensive outcrop is in wadi
    Maleh area where the sandstone is the main component. The two
    other exposures of this formation are in wadi Far'a and Luhuf
    Jadir and are composed mainly of a prominent craggy limestone.
    Ramali formation is an excellent aquifer, the cemented sandstone
    is well jointed and the bulk of the sand is porous (Table 4.1).
    </li>
   <li><i>Lower Beit Kahil Formation:</i>
    It forms the lower part of lower Cenomanian. The main outcrops
    are in wadi Far'a and in the north of the anticline axis area.
    The lower part of the formation consists mainly of thick, massive
    iron-stained limestone. The formation passes up through sandy
    marls and shales into thin-bedded porcellanous limestone. The
    formation has a thickness of 230 m (Table 4.1).
    </li>
   <li><i>Upper Beit Kahil Formation:</i>
    This formation is considered to be as equivalent to the upper
    part of the lower Cenomanian. The main outcrops are in wadi Far'a
    and Beit Furik and in the core of Ein Qinya anticline. It consists
    of dolomitic and sometimes chalky, and marly limestone. This formation
    has a small outcrop area because of its steep dips. It has a thickness
    of about 120-250 m. The formation is marked by joints and includes
    Carvenous limestone, thus forming a good aquifer (Table 4.1).
    </li>
   <li><i>Yatta Formation:</i> It
    forms the lower part of the middle Cenomanian and is exposed on
    both the east and west sides of the Judean anticline. This formation
    consists mainly of marl, chalky limestone, clay and thin interbedded
    dolomitic limestone. It has a thickness of about 150 m (Table
    4.1).
    </li>
   <li><i>Hebron Formation:</i>
    This formation is regarded as equivalent to the upper part of
    the middle Cenomanion. It is exposed in the west, southwest and
    southeast of Nablus district, and consists mainly of blue-green
    limestone and dolomitic limestone. The lower part of its outcrop
    is massive while the upper part is well bedded. The Hebron formation
    rocks have karst caves and joints, therefore it is an excellent
    aquifer (Table 4.1).
    </li>
   <li><i>Bethlehem Formation:</i>
    It is approximately equivalent to the upper Cenomanian and is
    exposed on the flanks of both the Far'a and Anabta anticlines.
    The bottom of the formation consists of dolomite, limestone, chalk
    and marl. It has a thickness of about 30-100 m (Table 4.1) (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#40">Rofe
    and Raffety, 1963</a>).
    </li>
   <li><i>Jerusalem Formation:</i>
    This formation belongs to the Turonian period. It is exposed in
    the west along the axial area of the Anabta anticline and in narrow
    strips flanking the Far'a anticline. It consists mainly of massive
    limestone, dolomite and, sometimes chalk. The formation varies
    in thickness and lithology and has a thickness of about 50-100
    m (Table 4.1).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h3>3- Rocks of the Cretaceous-Tertiary Transition
   Chalk with Chert:</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   This formation is composed mainly of chalk and ranges
   in age from approximately Coniacian at the base to Palaeocene
   at the top. The chalk is usually cream, buff or white, and occasionally
   dark colored due to the presence of bituminous materials. In some
   places of the formation, the chalk is associated with chert, therefor
   it tends to be phosphatic with some fish remains.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h3>4- Tertiary Rocks:</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   These consist of the following formations. 
   </p>
  <ul>
   <li><i>Jenin subseries:</i> It
    consists of Eocene aged rocks which are found in Nablus and Jenin
    areas. Outcrops are widely spread covering one third of the total
    area. Rocks of the Palaecene age consist mainly of chalk. In this
    formation, five facies of limestone and chalk have been described.
    These facies are chalk with minor chert, chalk with interbedded
    limestone, limestone with minor chalk, bedded massive limestone
    and Reef limestone. The total thickness of this formation is about
    500 m. Rocks of the Jenin subseries are caved and have joints,
    therefore they are considered as a major aquifer (Table 4.1).
    </li>
   <li><i>Bayda Formation:</i> It
    consists mainly of conglomerate resting on the exposed formations
    of the Cretaceous rocks. The formation is marked by rounded features.
    The area of Bayda was subjected to folding, faulting and uplifting.
    Recent erosion has cut down the solid rocks leaving capping on
    the interfluves (Table 4.1).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h3>5- Quaternary rocks:</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   They are divided into the following formations :
   </p>
  <ul>
   <li><i>Lisan formation:</i> It
    consists mainly of laminated marls and gypsum, marginally of gravels
    and poorly sorted pebble beds, occasionally calcareous and limestones.
    Total thickness is about 200 m (Table 4.1).
    </li>
   <li><i>Alluvium:</i> This formation
    is composed of alluvium consisting of unconsolidated marls with
    some siliceous sand. The derivation of the alluvium from the limestone
    gives it the red color and fine texture (Table 4.1). 
    </li>
   <li><i>Nari formation:</i> It
    occurs over all rocks especially in areas of high rainfall, where
    the carbonate rocks are dissolved by percolating water penetrating
    the upper zone of the outcrops. It forms a thin coating over the
    limestone with a thickness of about l0 m.
    </li>
   <li><i>Igneous rocks:</i> There
    was two periods of igneous activity. The first occurred between
    the Maleh and Ramali formation, at the end of the Jurassic to
    the early Cretaceous, and the second post-dates nummultic limestones
    of Eocene age. Outcrops are found in both wadi Far'a and wadi
    Maleh. In wadi Far'a basaltic layers are inter bedded with yellow-red
    sandstone.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Structural patterns:</h2>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Folds:</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The following folds exist in Nablus district:
   </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <h4><i>Anabta Anticline:</i></h4>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">
     It extends to about 25 km, and trends north-south.
     Its northern part has southerly pitch but the southern part is
     broken by faults. The Anabta anticline is symmetrical in structure.
     </p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">
     &nbsp;</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <h4><i>Nablus-Beit Qad Syncline:</i></h4>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">
     It covers an area of about 1500 km. The axis trends
     NNE-SSW, but near Jammaa'in it bends sharply westwards. The northern
     part has a northerly pitch except for the last few kilometers
     where it tilts southwards. The syncline is symmetrical with a
     gentle dipping west limb and a steep east limb (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/fig41.gif">Figure 4.1</a>).

    <p align="JUSTIFY">
     &nbsp;</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <h4><i>Ein Qinya Anticline: </i></h4>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">
     It passes through the area around Deir Es Sudan,
     then swings sharply eastwards to pass through Khirbet Qeis. It
     trends NE-SW and it is symmetrical in structure (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/fig41.gif">Figure 4.1</a>).
     </p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">
     &nbsp;</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <h4><i>Far'a Anticline:</i> 
     </h4>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   It is considered as one of the main folds in Nablus
   district. It trends NNW and extends to about 10 km. The east and
   west limbs of the anticline form two minor folds, Rujeib Monocline
   and Khirbet Fasayil Monocline. It's board axial area is distinguished
   from the flanks. The anticline has a symmetrical structure (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/fig41.gif">Figure
   4.1</a>).
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Faults: </h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   In Nablus district, the main depressed areas, like
   Far'a, Tubas and Tayasir Grabens are boarded by complex fault
   systems. Majdal Bani Fadil fault and Beit Furik fault also form
   major structures in the district. Most of faults trend NW - SE
   (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/fig41.gif">Figure 4.1</a>). Towards the west, the faults become more
   hummock
   and their impact therefore, becomes less visible. 
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Joints:</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Joints and solution channels are best developed in
   the lower Maleh, Hebron, and Jerusalem formations, as well as
   Nummulitic limestone facies.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   &nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Earthquakes:</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Several earthquakes happened during the last 2,000
   years. Records show that about 500 persons were killed and more
   others injured. In Nablus district, at least 33 earth movements
   have been recorded, some of these earthquakes were severe, others
   are moderate or weak.

  <h2>Soil</h2>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The soil characteristics and references to major
   vegetation were adopted from the document entitled, <i>The Soil
   of Israel (1976)</i>. The major soil associations found in Nablus
   district are as follows (Table 4.2 and <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/fig42.gif">Figure 4.2</a>).
