  <h2>Historical Background
   </h2>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Nablus is a Palestinian city located between Mt.
   Gerizim and Mt. 'Ibal. It is the site of an ancient city which
   was continuously occupied from Bronze age until the present. 
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Nablus city was built by the Canaanites on the remains
   of a Stone Age city. Its name was derived from the Canaanite word,
   Shekheim, which means a hilly area. Ruins of ancient Shekheim
   has been found on Tell Balata at Shekheim's east outskirts. Excavations
   have uncovered remains from the Chalcolithic to Roman periods,
   including city walls, towers and temples, a cuneiform Akkadian
   inscription and an Iron age seal (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#14">Encyclopedia Palaestina,
   1984</a>).
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   During the Canaanite period, prophet Abraham passed
   through the city in his way to Iraq. The Ya'coub well near Nablus,
   is the well which, Ya'coub, Ishaq's (Abraham's son) son bought
   when he traveled to Shekheim. Also it is the same well mentioned
   in the Bible, where Jesus spoke to the Samaritan woman (John,
   verse 4: 7-27). 
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Alexander the Great allowed a Samaritan temple to
   be built on Mt. Gerizim. In 129 BC, John Hyrcanus (Maccabean leader)
   seized Shekheim and destroyed the temple. In 72 BC Vespasian (a
   Roman leader) completely destroyed the old city and built a new
   city between Mt. Gerizim and Mt. Ebal, calling it <i>Flavia Neapolis</i>
   which means the new city (hence Arab name: Nablus). The Roman
   Emperor Zeno, built a church there and Justinian built several
   churches within the city proper (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#14">Encyclopedia Palaestina,
   1984.</a>)
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   In 636, the city was liberated by the Moslem commander
   'Amr Ibn Al'as and became one of the most famous and richest cities
   in Palestine. Moslems called it the Small Damascus because it
   was a very fertile land with plenty of water. Near the church
   ruins, there is a mosque-cut-tomb called Sheikh Ghanam, named
   after Ghanam Ibn Ali, senior minister of Salah Al-din.

    site for Christians and is called the Samaritan well, because
