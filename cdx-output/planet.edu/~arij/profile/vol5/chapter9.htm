  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   <b>Wastes range from the materials which are discarded
   in household dustbins to the by-products of industrial, chemical
   and agricultural activities. Public awareness of the dangerous
   effect of these wastes in human health and the environment has
   increased efforts to control waste disposal and management. Unfortunately,
   these efforts have not begin in the West Bank.
   </b></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><b>
   Proper solid waste management is one of the biggest
   environmental problems in the district. For example, types of
   refuse produced in Nablus city are brought to an uncontrolled
   dumping, located in an industrial area approximately 6.5 kilometers
   from the city.
   </b>   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Domestic Waste</h2>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The quantity of solid waste collected from houses,
   communities and markets varies from 0.9-1.0 kg per person every
   day. This estimated amount is based on normal values of many countries
   of the Mediterranean region. Sources of solid waste other than
   municipal waste may include wrecked cars, metal materials, demolition
   and construction waste, gardens refuse and other various materials.
   There is no accurate information regarding the composition of
   the solid waste generated in Palestine. However, an approximate
   estimation of the composition is shown in Table 9.1.

   Clearly, solid waste contains a large amount of organic

  <h2>Collection Service and Responsibility</h2>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Collection of domestic waste in Nablus district is
   either the responsibility of the municipalities, village councils,
   associations, the refugee camps administration (UNRWA). Several
   areas have no party responsible for waste collection, where most
   of the waste is dumped randomly. ARIJ survey of solid waste practices
   in the West Bank shows the distribution of responsibilities for
   domestic waste collection and disposal as in the following table.

   According to ARIJ survey, 60% of the waste is disposed
   of in public dumping sites, while 40% of the solid waste is disposed
   of randomly near houses, or in open spaces on road sides. Often
   the waste dumped at designated dumping sites or random sites is
   burned without control.

  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Collection containers and vehicles currently used
   by the municipalities, village councils, and UNRWA, vary in number
   and size. There are approximately 829 collection containers in
   Nablus district, of which 94% have a capacity of 1.0-4.9 CM and
   6% of the containers have a capacity of 5.0-10.0 CM. Vehicles
   which are used for collection in Nablus district, include 49 hand
   carts, 16 agricultural tractors and 14 trucks..

  <h3>Waste Disposal System</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The solid waste produced in Nablus city is brought
   to a dumping site located in the industrial zone, approximately
   6.5 km from the center of the city (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/fig91.gif">Figure 9.1</a>). The diverse
   solid
   waste produced in Nablus city can be classified as follows:

  <ul>
   <li>Refuse from houses, restaurants, hotels and businesses;

   <li>Refuse from hospitals, clinics and laboratories;
    and 
    </li>
   <li>Demolition, construction debris, wrecked houses,
    old cars and refrigerators.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Presently, no efforts are made in the West Bank to
   prevent air pollution from solid waste disposal. Unloaded refuse
   is burned in the open air. Air pollution created from burning
   could cause enormous dangers to the health of the citizens, in
   particular for those people living close to dumping sites.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   According to a survey conducted by the World Service
   in November 1994, 8 cases of lung cancer were discovered among
   the inhabitants of the Beit Dajan village, the nearest village
   to the existing dumping site. It is expected that the lung cancer
   is due to air pollution from open burning (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#29">Nablus Municipality,
   1994</a>). Dumping sites are not adequately designed to protect surface
   ground water. Often waste is dumped into wadis and leachate then
   percolates to the water system below. Also, the existing dumping
   sites are not fenced so stray animals are continuously scavenging
   in the site. More information is given in <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/appendix2.htm">Appendix 2</a>.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Industrial Waste</h2>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Major industrial activities in Nablus district include
   sweet factories, lathes and blacksmiths, shoes factories and workshops,
   textile, stone-cutting facilities and quarries, vegetable oil,
   ghee and detergents industry. There is no separate system for
   collecting or disposing of industrial wastes, hazardous or nonhazardous.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Around 49 olive mills, either old or semi automatic
   are operating machines in Nablus district. Four mills are single-lined
   fully automatic and 6 are double-lined fully automatic. These
   olive mills play an important role as supplier for the soap and
   detergent industries, as these consume most of the olive pulp
   which is generated from the milling process. All generated wastes
   are discarded on vacant lands or road sides. The rest of the olive
   residues (pulp) are either reused by people for heating, burned
   or discarded in nearby spaces.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   According to the survey conducted by ARIJ, around
   forty-five percent of the industrial facilities in Nablus district
   are located in industrial areas, 28% are located in residential
   areas, and 27% are located in commercial areas. The quantities
   of solid waste generated from the industrial facilities surveyed
   by ARIJ (excluding quarries and stone-cutting facilities) are
   shown in table 9.3.

   Eighteen out of 31 Quarries
   and stone cutting facilities in Nablus district produce approximately
   40,384 tons/yr of solid waste and  approximately 13,486 tons/yr
   of solid waste mixed with a large amount of water.  Forty-two
   percent of the solid waste is randomly dumped, negatively affecting
   both the human and the environment.  The remaining 58% of the
   generated solid waste is reused as building material in constructions.
   Table 9.5 shows the amounts of solid waste and wastewater generated
   by quarries and, <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/fig91.gif">Figure 9.1</a> shows the location of quarries
   in
   Nablus district.  Liquid wastes, either the slurry or sludge,
   are usually not treated before disposal.  Moreover, some farmers
   believe that adding slurry to olive trees will improve the soil
   texture.

   Large amounts of dust are released

  <h2>Medical Waste</h2>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Most of the medical waste generated
   from health institutions in Nablus district ends up in the municipal
   garbage.  Little of the generated medical waste is treated before
   disposal, thereby causing a threat to the human life.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Any proposed project to reduce
   the threat from medical waste must manage the waste safely from
   production to final destruction.  This means, the surrounding
   environment should not be polluted and the risks of infection
   for the people taking part in handling and disposing hospital
   waste should be minimized. 
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Four hospitals and twenty-one
   laboratories were surveyed by ARIJ.  Based on the survey results,
   approximately 42% of the medical centers are located in residential
   areas and 58% are located in commercial areas.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   None of the surveyed medical
   centers had any adequate treatment system to get rid of the medical
   waste.  Most of the waste is mixed with the municipal garbage
   in collection and disposal.  For example,  64% of the surveyed
   medical facilities disposed of the blood samples directly into
   the garbage without any previous treatment, 12% of the facilities
   incinerate the blood samples, 16% sterilized blood by autoclaving,
   and 8% sterilized blood samples by adding chlorine or alcohol
   (chlorination method).
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Transmission of pathogens to
   people is most likely to happen when handling sharp objects. 
   Approximately 64% of all the surveyed medical centers dump their
   sharp objects without any proper treatment.  This increases the
   risk of infection for the people who are collecting and handling
   the garbage. 
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Most of the medical centers
   use septic solutions for cleaning bed sheets.  But, only a few
   of them isolate the sheets and the instruments used by patients
   with infectious diseases from the rest.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   All the surgery wastes from
   the hospitals are held in plastic bags and disposed of in the
   domestic garbage bins.  Most of the lab technicians in hospitals,
   clinics and laboratories do not use safety tools such as gloves
   or masks.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   During the 28 years of Israeli
   occupation, the Health Department did not perform any periodical
   inspection for the medical and health centers.  For example, approximately
   52% of the medical centers had never been subjected to any kind
   of inspection. 
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Recently, the Palestinian Ministry
   of Health took over the health issues and started to conduct a
   periodical inspection to all medical centers in the West Bank.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Recommendation</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>The collection system needs
    to be upgraded to eliminate random dumping of wastes.
    </li>
   <li>A modern sanitary landfill
    should be constructed for Nablus district, taking into account
    environmental impacts on the site and leachate monitoring and
    control.
    </li>
   <li>A composting program should
    be established to use the large percentage of organic matter.
    </li>
   <li>Waste materials should be
    reused and recycled to the largest degree possible.
    </li>
   <li>Medical waste and industrial
    hazardous waste should be properly controlled to protect human
    heath and the environment.
    </li>
   <li>Public awareness about proper
    solid waste management should be increased.
