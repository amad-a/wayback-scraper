The Applied Research Institute - Jerusalem
 (ARIJ)  launched a two year project in July 1994 to produce a
series of environmental profiles for each district in the West
Bank.  The aim of this project was to assess the status of the
environment in Palestine and to reflect the special characteristics
of the environmental problems and the measures required to safeguard
and preserve our environment for the future generations.  This
project is supported and financed by the Federal Government of
Austria, Department for Development Cooperation, through the Society
for Austro - Arab Relations (SAAR).  This volume is the fifth
in this series.  It describes the status of the environment in
Nablus district.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
The Nablus District Environmental Profile
addresses the natural resources and describes the scope and extent
of the environmental problems facing the district.   Moreover,
it provides data which are helpful for planning and initiating
the needed projects to rehabilitate environmentally stressed areas
and prevent future deterioration.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
Information concerning land use, topography,
climate, geology, soil, water resources, agriculture, wastewater
and solid waste collection and disposal, air and noise pollution
is presented in this profile.  In addition, it covers the socio-economic
situation and the existing historical and archeological sites
existing in the district and their current status and state of
repair. 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
As the extension of the flora and fauna
are unrestricted to the boundaries of the district, they will
be addressed collectively with those of the other districts in
the Comprehensive Environmental Profile for the whole West Bank,
at the end of the year 1996.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
Most of the information and data used
in this report were collected by the project team and  based on
primary field research, questionnaire, investigations, personal
interviews and meetings with officials from municipalities, village
councils, the United Nations for Relief and Work Agency (UNRWA),
the agricultural institutions, weather station and hospitals.
 Maps and information related to land areas are all prepared by
the Geographic Information System unit team ARIJ.
