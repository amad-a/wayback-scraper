   <b>Nablus district has varying agro-climatological zones,
   ranging from the Jordan Valley in the east which is as low as
   250 meters below the sea level with only 244 mm average annual
   rainfall, to a mountainous zone in the central and western parts
   with an annual rainfall which reaches 663 mm (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#28">Meteorological

  <h2>Areas of Plant production
   </h2>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Depending on the agro-climatological conditions of
   Nablus district, the areas of plant production can be classified
   as follows.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>The Mountainous Area</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   This area includes Nablus city and the surrounding
   towns and villages, and contains the fertile and the rainfed cultivated
   lands.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>The Northern Part of the Jordan Valley
   </h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   This area extends from Fasayil in the south to Ein
   El Bayda and Bardala in the north, and from Froush Beit Dajan
   in the west to the Jordan River in the East. Most of the agricultural
   lands in this area are recognized as flat or gently sloping towards
   the east. Soil of this area can be classified as sandy, clay,
   or a mixture of both. The soil formation in this region improves
   the cultivation conditions. The climate of this area is hot in
   summer and relatively warm in winter. Precipitation rates are
   low and the potential evaporation is high, thus rainfed agriculture
   in this part is not effective. 
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Ghor El Far'a
   </h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The agricultural land in this area is fertile, with
   good water quality for irrigation. Most of the cultivated areas
   are under irrigation. 
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Plant production
   </h2>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   In the 1994 growing season, the agricultural land
   of the district was approximately 28,992 hectares. The area cultivated
   with rainfed crops was approximately 25,634 hectares, while the
   irrigated agriculture covered approximately 3,358 hectares. Rainfed
   agriculture produced 24,342 tons of cultivated crops, compared
   to 67,072 tons produced from the irrigated crops. <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/fig61.gif">Figure 6.1</a>

  <h3>Fruit trees:</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Fruit orchards cover a total area of approximately
   20,062 hectares, with an average total production of approximately
   28,267 tons in the 1994 growing season.  Rainfed fruit trees are
   dominant in Nablus district, covering approximately 19,719 hectares.
   Only 341 hectares of fruit trees area is irrigated.  Although
   irrigated trees have a limited area, they account for nearly 30%
   of the total production of the 1994 growing season, as shown in
   <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/fig62.gif">figure 6.2</a> (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#13">Department of Agriculture

  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Olives trees cover approximately 85% of the total
   area for fruit trees.  This area includes 400 hectares of unproductive
   olive trees and 16,718 hectares of productive olive trees under
   rainfed conditions, and only 15.4 hectares under irrigation. 
   Olive trees contribute 58.1% of the total fruit production.  
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Stone fruit trees, including almonds, plums, and
   apricots are cultivated under rainfed conditions only.  They cover
   approximately 1,903 hectares and produce about
   530 tons/y.  Almonds have the lowest productivity of 170 kg/hectare
   and plums have the highest productivity of 1,500 kg/hectare.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Fig trees make up a total area of approximately 5,174
   hectares producing around 2,328 tons per year.  These trees are
   totally cultivated under rainfed conditions.  The average productivity
   of fig trees in the 1994 growing season was approximately 4,500
   kg/hectare.  Although the figures indicate that fig trees have
   a good productivity, applying improved methods of cultivation,
   picking, packaging and marketing may increase or double the productivity.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Rainfed grape vines cover approximately 113 hectares
   with total production of 283 tons.  Irrigated grapes cover only
   8.9 hectares and have a total production of 213.3 tons.  Irrigated
   grape vines are mainly cultivated in the eastern part of the district.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   In addition, there are 61.9 hectares planted with
   apples, pomegranates, and other fruit trees which are grown under
   rainfed conditions.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Irrigated fruit trees, which are cultivated in the
   lower eastern parts of the district, include citrus, bananas,
   olives, date palms, grapes and avocado orchards.  There are 5
   types of cultivated citrus trees that cover a total area of 276.8
   hectares and produce 7,844 tons/year.  The average productivity
   of the citrus trees in the 1994 growing season was 2.8 tons/hectare.
   There are different orange varieties (joint, Valancia, local
   or baladi, French, and Shamoti), which make up about 50% of the
   citrus area and 43% of its production.  The remaining area of
   citrus trees is devoted to lemon, mandarin, clementine, and grapefruit.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Field crops and forages:</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   In the 1994 growing seasons, the total area used for field crops
   in Nablus district was approximately 6,166 hectares (21.3% of
   the total cultivated area) with a total production of 7,509 tons.
   Rainfed field crops and forages cover an area of 5,597 hectares,
   while irrigated field crops and forages make up only 569.5
   hectares (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/fig63.gif">Figure 6.3</a>).

   </center>
  </div>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Approximately 91% of total field crops and forages
   are cultivated under rainfed conditions.  Most of planted rainfed
   field crops are located in the central and western
   parts of the district.  Soil fertility decreases gradually from
   the west towards the east, and so does the average annual rainfall.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Wheat is the most prominent crop under rainfed cultivation,
   making up approximately 2,835 hectares (about 50% of the total
   area of rainfed field crops and forages) and producing 60% of
   the total yield.  Barley, broom corn, bitter vetch, common vetch,
   chickpeas, lentils, dry broad beans, sesame, fenugreek and dill
   form the rest of the rainfed production.  On average, barley has
   the highest grain yield ranging between 500 kg/hectare in the
   eastern parts of the district to 1,200 kg/hectare in the mountainous
   area of the district.  This is followed by wheat producing  610-840
   kg/hectare (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/fig64.gif">Figure 6.4</a>).

  </div>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Irrigated field crops and forages are cultivated
   only in the eastern parts of the district.  These include wheat,
   barley and green forages.  In the 1994 growing season, irrigated
   wheat had the largest area (364.2 hectares), followed by barley
   (125.8 hectares).  Barley has the highest grain yield (6,000 kg/hectare)
   followed by wheat (5,000 kg/hectare), while the planted crops
   that are used for green forages (e.g. alfalfa and Egyptian clover)
   produced 15,000 kg/hectare (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/fig64.gif">Figure 6.4</a>).

  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Vegetables</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Vegetables cover approximately 2,764 hectares (9.5%)
   of the total cultivated area in the district.  Irrigated vegetables
   have the largest area, approximately 2,446 hectares (88.5% of
   the total vegetables area), while rainfed vegetables cover only
   318 hectares (11.5% of the total vegetables area).  Almost 98%
   of the total vegetable production come from   irrigated vegetables
   (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/fig65.gif">Figure 6.5</a>).

  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Cultivation of the irrigated vegetables can be divided
   into three systems:
   </p>
  <ul>
   <li>vegetables cultivated under plastic houses, covering
    0.6% of the area for irrigated  vegetables; 
    </li>
   <li>vegetables covered with low plastic tunnels, covering
    17% of the total area for irrigated vegetables; 
    </li>
   <li>and vegetables cultivated in the open field, covering
    82.4% of the total area of irrigated vegetables.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Tomatoes, cucumber, green beans, and eggplants are
   the main crops cultivated under plastic houses.  The average productivity
   differs for each crop: 150 tons/hectare for tomatoes; 70 tons/hectare
   for cucumber;  and 30 tons/hectare for green beans.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Low plastic tunnels are usually used for early season
   planting, to protect the crops against low temperatures during
   winter.  About 9 different crops are usually planted under low
   plastic tunnels.  Tomatoes and squash are the main crops, occupying
   approximately 158 hectares and 141 hectares respectively.  The
   average productivity, under low plastic tunnels, varies from 15.8
   tons/hectare for squash to 6 tons/hectare for
   okra and pumpkin.   
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Twenty-five types of vegetable crops are grown using
   the irrigated open field system.  Squash, cucumber, sweet maize,
   and tomatoes are the most dominant vegetables.  The average productivity
   of the open field vegetables ranges between 30.6 tons/hectare
   for turnip and 7.3 tons/hectare for green beans (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/fig66.gif">Figure 6.6</a>).

  </div>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The variation in productivity between different cropping
   systems is related directly to the planting date, the duration
   of growing period, and the micro-climatic conditions existing
   around the growing plants.  Most of the irrigated vegetables are
   planted in the eastern parts of the district, especially in Ghor
   El Far'a.  
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   About 10 different vegetable crops are cultivated
   under rainfed conditions.  Dry onions have the largest area, approximately
   79 hectares, followed by snake cucumber using 76 hectares.  Average
   productivity varies between 5 tons/hectare for muskmelon to 0.8
   tons/hectare for garlic.  Most of the rainfed vegetables are concentrated
   in the mountainous areas of the district.
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Land Tenure</h2>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Most of the agricultural lands that are located in
   Ghor El Far'a and the northern parts of the Jordan Valley are
   owned by families from Nablus city.  The majority of the local
   population work as employed farmers and utilize most of these
   lands through a sharing system.  In other agricultural lands in
   the district, the farmers and their families own and cultivate
   their lands.  
   </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Irrigation methods
   </h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The currently used irrigation methods can be classified
   into ways:
   </p>
  <ol>
   <li>Traditional methods, using furrows or basins.
    These have an efficiency rate of approximately 45%.
    </li>
   <li>Modern techniques of irrigation, such as sprinklers
    or drip irrigation systems.  The sprinkler system increases the
    water efficiency rate to 60-70%, and drip system has an efficiency
    rate exceeding 80%.  Modern techniques minimize water losses through
    evaporation, seepage and deep percolation, and
    thus save 25-35% of the irrigation water.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The application of the above systems varies according
   to the crop type, soil texture, water quality and soil slope.
   Modern techniques are rarely used by local farmers for irrigating
   citrus orchards.  On the contrary, traditional methods are more
   popular and used by all farmers.  Modern techniques are, however,
   much more commonly used for vegetables and field crops.

   When estimating the real of water requirements for

  <ul>
   <li>Effective rainfall;
    </li>
   <li>Irrigation method efficiency;
    </li>
   <li>Soil texture and salinity; and
    </li>
   <li>Water quality parameters (including salinity,
    chloride, and sodium).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The quality of the applied water
   plays a major role in determining the quantities of water needed
   for irrigation.  In Ghor El Far'a, Nablus city and the surrounding
   towns and villages, the quality of water is good for irrigation.
   As a result, adding additional water for leaching the salts from
   the root zone is not necessary.  On the other hand, in the northern
   parts of the Jordan Valley, water which is extracted from wells,
   suffers from salinity problems as represented by high values of
   electrical conductivity and/or total dissolved solids, chloride,

  Approximately 43.2% of the forested areas in Nablus
  district are located in "Areas C", thus being totally
  under the Israeli control.  The 70 hectares of the forested area
  (Table 6.3) which are currently under Palestinian
  control, are located in steep and rocky areas.  These areas have
  not received any maintenance or development (replanting, pruning,
  or protection) since 1971.  The lack of management has made this
  area vulnerable to disease, insects, fire, and cutting, as well
  as natural destruction from heavy snow or high winds.

  <h3>Pesticide usage in Nablus district</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The total quantity of pesticides (excluding methyl
   bromide) used in Nablus district in 1994 growing season, was around
   73.0 tons.  The annual treated area with pesticides is 5,524 hectares,
   43% of which is rainfed farming, and 57% under irrigated conditions.
   Irrigated agriculture forms about 81%  of total pesticide consumption.
   <br>
   Irrigated vegetables make up the largest percentage
   of treated area with 43%, and consumed up to  57 tons' pesticides,
   annually.

  <h3>Livestock, Poultry, and Apiculture
   production
   Cattle</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Over the West Bank, the largest number of cattle
   is found in Nablus district.  There are approximately 2,239 dairy
   cows, of which 75% are of Friesian breed and the remaining 25%
   are local (Table 6.4).  Natural range lands provide feed for nearly
   60% of the local breed of cattle, usually for a period extending
   from the end of the summer to mid winter.  Cereal grains are used
   as complementary feed when range pasture production is insufficient.
   Friesian cattle are usually fed cereal grains and forage crops
   in barns all year.

   up 65.5% of the total number of small ruminants.  Goats account
   for nearly 27.5%, and hybrid Assaf only 7% (Records of the Nablus
   Department of Agriculture, 1995).

  <h3>Agiculture</h3>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   Nablus district houses approximately 1,160 permanent
   beehives and 2000 seasonal ones.  The seasonal beehives are temporarily
   moved to the Jordan Valley during the flowering season of citrus
   trees (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#13">Records of the Nablus Department of Agriculture,
   1995</a>).

  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The Italian breed predominates with approximately
   61% of beehives in the district, 35% are of hybrid breeds, and
   the remaining 4% are of local breed, known as Baladi.  On average,
   the productivity of honey for the different breeds of bees ranges
   between 11 kg/year for the local bees and 16 kg/year for the Italian
   bees, per beehive (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol5/refn.htm#2">PARC and Arab Thought Forum 1994</a>).

  <h2>Recommendations</h2>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   The following recommendations may be important in
   contributing to the development of the agriculture in Nablus district:
   </p>
  <ol>
   <li>Investigating the best methods to improve irrigated
    agriculture in terms of water use efficiency, environmental sustainability,
    productivity and marketing.
    </li>
   <li>Improving the currently agricultural research
    and extension programs in the district.
    </li>
   <li>Developing integrated pest management programs
    with farmers to help them manage agricultural pests without harming
    the environment, human health, or the market potentials of crops.
    </li>
   <li>Establishing a Grading and storage center for
    surplus production should be constructed to meet the international
    standards of marketing and exporting for agricultural commodities.
    </li>
   <li>Opening new markets for exporting the surplus
    agricultural production</li>
