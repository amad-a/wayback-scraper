<h2><font color="Black">Introduction</font></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Solid waste management is
 an essential urban service which is provided to achieve the following
 objectives:
 </p>
<ul>
 <li>protection of public health,
  </li>
 <li>promotion of hygiene,
  </li>
 <li>recycling of materials,
  </li>
 <li>avoidance of waste,
  </li>
 <li>reduction of waste quantities, and
  </li>
 <li>reduction of emissions and residuals.
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 A healthy city must
 have a planned program for effective 
 collection and proper handling
 and disposal of solid waste so as to create a safe and pleasant
 urban environment.  Hence there will be national, regional and
 local issues to be addressed and, increasingly, an international
 dimension to be considered in formulating an environmentally sound
 program for solid waste management.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 An organized program for solid
 waste management in urban areas is essential if cities are to
 be healthy places to live, and environmentally attractive to visitors
 and residents.  Institutional planning is the key to achieving
 an acceptable and affordable system, but the success of any scheme
 will depend on the cooperation of the people and their aspirations
 for a safe and aesthetically pleasing urban environment.  
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The amount of waste per household and the volume of industrial waste
 are growing rapidly. The content of waste is also changing, requiring
 greater care in handling and disposal.  Many municipal waste collection
 systems currently provided are inadequate, leading to waste dumping
 in wadis, road sides and open spaces.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The responsibility for waste
 collection in the Hebron District is divided between the municipalities,
 town or village councils and UNRWA in the refugee camps.  There
 are common methods for waste disposal in the district: municipal
 or village council waste is disposed in waste dumps, or open dump
 sites, and a large amount of individual waste is disposed randomly
 in nearby open spaces or road sides.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Over the past decades the
 responsible parties have paid little attention to improving the
 financial and technical management of their solid waste operations
 and have made no attempt to encourage re-use and recycling of
 materials.  Lack of public cooperation is also a significant obstacle
 to effective solid waste management.  
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font color="Black">Risks to Human Health</font></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="Black">
 Solid waste is likely to contain human pathogens, from disposed baby
 diapers, paper handkerchiefs, contaminated food and waste from
 pets.  Handling and disposal of solid wastes could present a potential
 for disease transmission similar to that of collection and disposal
 of excreta and sewage.  In addition, inadequate storage and collection
 and poor disposal practices serve as breeding sites for rats,
 flies, mosquitoes, cockroaches and other vermin which can act
 as passive vectors in transmitting diseases.
 </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="Black">
 Apart from the potential
 health risks arise from the possible presence of infectious agents
 in solid waste.  General public, workers employed in solid waste
 collection and disposal are exposed to health risks.  Thus, the
 public health concerns and safety risks which might be associated
 with solid waste are:
 </font></p>
<ul>
 <li><font color="Black">exposure to pathogens,
  </font></li>
 <li><font color="Black">exposure to toxic and hazardous substances, and
  </font></li>
 <li><font color="Black">physical injury.
  </font></li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font color="Black">Domestic Waste</font></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Collection of domestic
 waste in the district is either the responsibility of the municipality,
 town and village councils or UNRWA in the refugee camps.  Table
 9.1 shows the distribution of responsibilities for domestic waste
 collection and disposal.

 The quantity of the generated domestic solid waste in the district
 of Hebron is estimated to be 260 tons/day excluding the refugee
 camps. According to UNRWA officials, the two camps Al-'Aroub and
 Al-Fawwar generate close to 10.3 tons/day of domestic waste. The
 camps dispose of  their waste in a dumping site near Beit Ummar
 village, this dumping site is nearly 15 km away from Al-'Aroub
 R.C. and 25 km away from Al-Fawwar R.C.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Collection containers and
 vehicles that are currently used throughout the municipalities,
 towns, and camps vary in number and size.  In the Hebron District
 there are approximately 680 containers of which close to 83% are
 1.0-4.9 m3 in volume, 11% are 0.4-0.9 m3, 3.0% are 6.1-9.0 m3,
 and 2.0% are 5.0-6.0 m3.  The vehicles used for collection include
 hand carts, agricultural tractors, and trucks of various types
 and capacities.  There are 22 carts, 3 agricultural tractors,
 and 15 trucks used throughout the district.  More information
 is shown in <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol3/apendix4.htm">Appendix 4</a>, Table 9.2.

<h2><font color="Black">Industrial Waste</font></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Hebron District is distinguished in its industrial
 activities. Quarrying, leather  and metallic industries are the
 core of Hebron's industrial base.  Leather industries which include
 leather tanning, shoe factories, and workshops constitute approximately
 40%, stone cutting factories and quarries constitute approximately
 15%, and the metallic industries form about 14% of the total industries
 in the district (Hebron Chamber of commerce, 1995).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 According to ARIJ survey, approximately 31% of industrial facilities are located
 in residential areas, 19% in industrial area, 26% in commercial
 areas and the remaining 24% are located in agricultural areas.
 The major quarrying sites are found near Sa'ir and Yatta.  Processing
 and manufacturing industries, mainly food and agro-processing,
 clothing, textile, leather products and furniture are concentrated
 in Hebron City.  Units for tile production, and other construction
 materials are found in several locations in the district. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font color="Navy"><b><font color="Black">Quarrying and Stone Processing</font></b></font></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="Black">
 Quarrying and stone processing are considered
 the leading industries in the West Bank, and are also major contributors
 to environmental degradation and pollution.  Air pollution in
 these areas is of great concern as enormous quantities of dust
 and particulate matter are released into the air causing potential
 harm to the nearby residents and land.
 </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="Black">
 According to the Hebron
 Chamber of Commerce, 60 stone processing facility exist in the
 district. The generated solid waste from these facilities is
 approximately 110,000 tons/year., the majority is stone debris,
 about 20,000 tons/y is stone slurry.  The stone debris is dumped
 on nearby road sides or vacant land adjacent to the facilities.
 The generated slurry is disposed either in open areas where it
 clogs the soil pores resulting in soil and plant damage or into
 the wastewater network system causing many technical problems
 to the network or the pumping station.  As mentioned earlier,
 the pumping station at Hebron City was damaged after only a few
 months of operation due to slurry disposal from the stone cutting
 facilities.  The slurry in the district is not treated before
 disposal, unlike some other areas of the West Bank.
 </font></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><font color="Black">Tanning</font></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Tanning of leather and hides has been an important industrial activity
 in the district.  There are 10 tanning factories in the district
 located mainly in the industrial area of Hebron City.  The produced
 leather is exported to Israel, the United States of America, and
 Turkey along with the local market.  Irrespective of the immediate
 economic benefits of production, pollution from tanneries has
 a considerable negative long-term environmental impact.  In addition
 to the traditional problems of air and water pollution, there
 are other environmental concerns such as chemical safety, contamination
 of land and groundwater, and the general nuisance of odor and
 noise of installations.  Many of these impacts are on the health
 and safety of workers.  The generated solid waste which is mainly
 of animal origin is a powerful pollutant in water and is also
 highly odorous when it decomposes.  The generated solid waste
 from this industry is usually dumped and burned on vacant lands
 adjacent to the factories (Photo).  The wastewater which contains
 large quantities of carcinogenic Chromium and Sulfide are disposed
 untreated in the wastewater network of the Hebron City which is
 subsequently disposed freely in the adjacent wadi.  Table 9.3
 shows the composition of a typical tannery effluent (UNEP, 1991).

<h2> <font color="Black">Other Industries</font></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The analysis of approximately
 20% of the industries in the district, other than quarries and
 stone cutting facilities, revealed that the solid waste is generated
 either when the materials are produced or during packaging.  Packaging
 material, composed of paper, carton, metal, plastic, wood and
 Jute, constitutes considerable amount out of the total generated
 waste.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The major contributors to solid waste is the metallic and
 leather industries.  Plastic factories generate small quantities
 of solid waste because most of the generated waste is recycled
 back in the production line.  The seasonally generated olive pulp
 in the district is approximately 9000 tons/year.

 Medical Waste There is
 a growing awareness, on a worldwide scale, of the need to impose
 strict controls over the disposal of wastes generated by hospitals
 and other health care services.  Medical wastes are typically
 classified as follows.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
 <li>Pathological waste.  Including all human tissue (whether
  infected or not) such as limbs, organs, blood and other body fluids,
  and tissue from laboratories.
  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
 </li>
 <li>Infectious waste. This consists of used surgical dressings,
  swabs, cultures and stocks of infectious agents from laboratory
  work; dialysis equipment, apparatus and disposable gowns, aprons,
  gloves, etc.
  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
 </li>
 <li>Sharp objects. This category includes needles, syringes,
  scalpels, blades, saws, nails, broken glass and any other items
  which could cut or puncture.
  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
 </li>
 <li>Pharmaceutical waste.  This includes pharmaceutical products,
  drugs, and chemicals which have been returned from wards, spilled
  or soiled, or to be discarded for any reason.
  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
 </li>
 <li>Chemical waste.  Examples are discarded solid, liquid
  or gaseous chemicals from laboratories or other sources such as
  diagnostic work, experimental work, cleaning, housekeeping and
  disinfecting procedures.  Hazardous chemical waste includes: toxic
  materials, corrosive (acids below pH 2.0 and alkalis above pH
  12.0), highly flammable materials, reactive (explosive, shock
  sensitive, water reactive, air reactive), and genotoxic (carcinogenic,
  mutagenic).
  <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
 </li>
 <li>Aerosols and pressurized containers.  Included those used
  for treatment, instruction or demonstration purposes, those containing
  innocuous or inert gases and other containers which may explode
  if incinerated punctured.
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The medical waste  generated in the Hebron
 District is a threat to the population of the area, as little
 of the generated medical waste is properly treated before disposal
 and most ends up with the municipal garbage. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Before starting any
 proposed project to reduce the threat from medical waste, it must
 be considered that the waste should be disposed safely in all
 terms, from production to final destruction. This means, the surrounding
 not be polluted and that risk of infection for the people taking
 part in handling and disposing hospital waste should be minimized.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Three hospitals, ten private laboratories and three clinics in the district
 were surveyed by ARIJ. Approximately 25% of the medical centers
 are located in residential areas, 67% are located in commercial
 areas and 8% are located in industrial areas.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 None of the medical
 centers which were visited have any special dumps or incinerators
 for the medical waste. Most of the waste is disposed and mixed
 with municipal garbage.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 For example, nearly 86.7% of the blood
 samples are disposed directly into the garbage without any previous
 treatment to guarantee the prevention of microbial or viral contamination
 and infection, 6.6% usually incinerate the blood samples and 6.7%
 dispose of the blood samples in the sewage network.  All other
 medical objects and tools are discarded with the municipal waste.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The sharp objects such as needles and lancets should be covered or
 placed in special containers before being disposed. More than
 87% of all medical centers surveyed  dump these sharp objects
 without any special treatment. This increases the risks of infection
 of those people who are dealing with such objects during collection
 of the garbage.  Most of medical centers use septic solutions
 for cleaning bed sheets.  On the other hand, only a few of them
 isolate sheets and instruments used by patients with infectious
 disease from the rest.  
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The only exceptional item sterilized by
 autoclave before disposal is petri dishes which are used for bacterial
 growth.  Around 47% of the medical centers in Hebron District
 use autoclaving to treat petri dishes while 7% of them usually
 burned.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 All the surgery wastes, from the general and hospitals,
 are held in plastic bags and disposed of into the garbage bins.
 Most of the lab technicians in hospitals, clinics and laboratories
 don't use safety equipment such as gloves or masks.  Most also
 lack medical or health insurance coverage.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The health department
 does not perform any periodical inspection to medical and health
 centers.  For example, around 87.5% of the medical centers were
 never subjected to any kind of inspection by the health department.
 A program needs to be implemented to manage medical waste in
 a way that reduces risks of infection, pollution, and protect
 the personnel responsible for handling and disposing of the medical
 waste.  The major risks facing personnel are as follows:
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>Personnel handling waste containing blood-soaked objects
  from patients in dialysis units must be protected against the
  transmission of hepatitis. Special arrangements are necessary
  for the isolation, separation, collection and disposal of this
  waste.<br>
  </li>
 <li>Custodial personnel, maintenance staff and porters could
  be at risk from waste that contains sharp items such as syringes
  and needles, if these have not been kept separate and safely packaged
  for disposal.<br>
  </li>
 <li>Personnel involved in the final disposal of waste may
  be exposed to risk from pathological waste, especially if the
  wrapping or storage sacks are punctured or torn.<br>
  </li>
 <li>Custodial personnel could be exposed to risk on any premises
  where leaks or obstructions in drain system result in the escape
  of gases or hazardous solvents that may be inhaled.  Exposure
  to H2S escaping from blocked sewers is a well known hazard.<br>
  </li>
 <li>Personnel working in or visiting clinical laboratories
  where pathogenic micro- organisms, infectious agents or pathological
  materials are examined, handled or stored could be at great risk
  from wastes which may be generated there.
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font color="Black">Recommendations</font></h2>
<ul>
 <li>Sanitary landfill should be constructed for the Hebron
  District, taking into account environmental impacts on the site
  and leachate monitoring and control.<br>
  </li>
 <li>Treatment of solid waste should be introduced to reduce
  the mass or volume of the waste and achieve one or more of following
  objectives:- improvement of its acceptability in environmental
  terms,- separation and recovery of recyclable material or energy,
  and- reduction of transport costs.<br>
  </li>
 <li>Public awareness about proper waste management should
  be increased.  Health and hygiene instructions must include home
  and community hygiene and stress the health implications of poor
  solid waste storage, collection and disposal practice.<br>
  </li>
 <li>Hazardous waste, including medical waste, should be collected
  and disposed of separately.<br>
  </li>
 <li>Municipalities and village councils need to have solid
  waste storage facilities and vehicles.
  </li>
</ul>
