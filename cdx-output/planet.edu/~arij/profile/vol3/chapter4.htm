<p align="JUSTIFY">Water shortage is a serious problem
facing the Hebron District, 
not only due to the arid and semi-arid
climatic conditions and 
rainfall variability in the area, but
also due to the Israeli strict 
control over the Palestinian water
resources.  The &amp;Taba Agreement 
&amp; which signed on September
28, 1995, contains an undertaking on the 
part of Israel to increase
the amount of water allocated to Palestinians by 28.6 mcm/year.
Any further addition to either side will be based on an increase
in the available water resources to be developed through international
funding and channels. The agreement provides for the establishment
of a Joint Water Committee that will manage water resources and
enforce water policies, protecting the interests of both parties
by the prevention of uncontrolled drilling by enforcing standards.
The agreement provides Hebron and Bethlehem Districts with one
million cm/year from the above mentioned quantity (Documents of
Taba Agreement 1995).

<h3><font color="Black">Groundwater Aquifers</font></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Hebron is located on the crest of the anticline structure extending from
 Beer Sheva' area in the south to Jerusalem area in the north forming
 the Hebron mountain series.  There are two main aquifer systems
 in the district:
 </p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <h4><font color="Black"><b>Lower Cenomanian Aquifer System</b></font><font color="Maroon"><b></b></font><b></b></h4>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   This system feeds the Herodion and Jerusalem boreholes and the springs in
   the Dead Sea area.   The geologic formations of this aquifer system
   are Lower &amp; Upper Beit Kahil  (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol3/refh.htm#r28">Rofe &amp; Raffety,
   1963</a>) and
   are mainly composed of Dolomite, Limestone, Marly and Chalky Limestone.

 </li>
 <li>
  <h4><font color="Black"><b>Upper Cenomanian Aquifer System</b></font><font color="Maroon"><b></b></font><b></b></h4>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">
   This system feeds Al-'Aroub, Sa'ir and Dirwa springs, as well as other springs
   in the area.  It also
   feeds Al-Fawwar, Beit Fajjar, Samu', and Rihiya well fields. This
   aquifer system is mainly composed of Limestone, Chalky Limestone,
   and Dolomite.

<h2><font color="Black">Sources of Water</font></h2>
<h3><font color="Black"><b>Groundwater Wells</b></font><b></b></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are four licensed groundwater wells in the Hebron District
 which are used for domestic purposes.  As mentioned previously,
 these wells are controlled by the following: 
 </p>
<ul>
 <li>The Hebron Municipality and West Bank Water Department
  which includes Fawwar wells No.1 and No.2 and whose total discharge
  to the network is approximately 105 m3 /hr.<br>
  </li>
 <li>The Mekorot (Israeli Water Company) uses Samu' and Rihiya
  wells and the total discharge is undeclared to the Palestinians.
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are also 64 traditional shallow groundwater wells which are un-licensed
 and used for irrigation purposes.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b><font color="Black">Proposed Deep Groundwater Well in Sa'ir Area</font></b></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 To increase water supply to the Hebron District
 and reduce water shortage, Hebron Municipality requested permission
 from the Israeli military authority to construct a deep groundwater
 well to tap the Lower Beit Kahil formation (Lower Cenomanian Aquifer)
 in the Herodion area (Wadi Sa'ir).  The Municipality has succeeded
 in 1995 in obtaining the necessary permission to drill this new
 well in Wadi Sa'ir close to Taquo' Area (13 km north of the city).
 The project will enhance the Municipality's own water recourses
 to meet the minimum demand currently estimated at about 70 l/c/day.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The well is planned to be 700 meters deep and 18 inches in diameter,
 and will have all the necessary electro-mechanical accessories
 and a 13 km conveyance pipeline (16 inch diameter) which will
 carry the water to the central reservoir in Hebron. The site is
 selected by the West Bank Water Department (WBWD) near the two
 operating wells at Herodion (Batn El-Ghoul 4 &amp; 5).  The estimated
 well's yield will be approximately 300-400 m3/hr, and will tap
 the Lower Beit Kahil geologic formation. Tahal (1979) had recommended
 to drill two wells at the same site, one in the upper and one
 in the lower Cenomanian aquifer.
 </p>

<h3><font color="Black"><b>Springs</b></font><font color="Maroon"><b></b></font></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are approximately 57 springs, see <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol3/fig42.gif">figure 4.2</a>, in
 the Hebron District which are freely
 used by the surrounding population without restrictions for small
 scale domestic and irrigation purposes.  Table 4.1 shows the main
 springs of the Hebron District and their discharge rate.  The
 springs and their discharge rate can be seen in table 4.2 of appendix
 3.

<h3><font color="Black">Rainwater harvesting</font></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Rainwater harvesting is a common practice
 in the West Bank.  During the winter, the rainwater is collected
 from the roofs of the houses and stored in cisterns.  Two types
 of rain water catchment systems are used.  One system works on
 a large scale to collect storm water runoff from the ground. 
 This water is then stored in large reservoirs. The other system
 collects rain water on a small scale from controlled surfaces,
 such as a roof.  This water is stored in small reservoirs, known
 as cisterns, constructed underneath or next to house. The average
 capacity of the existing cisterns is 70 m3.  According to Hebron
 Municipality, 60% of the inhabitants of the city have cisterns
 in their houses. In rural areas, the percentage of inhabitants
 using cistern collection systems is higher than in the city. 
 This is because some of the small villages and khirabes are not
 connected to water   distribution networks, thus experiencing
 a shortage of water.  Also, if connected, rural areas suffer from
 frequent shortage in water supply.
 </p>
<h2><font color="Black">Current Water Situation</font></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The responsible authorities for water supply in the Hebron District are:
 </p>
<ul>
 <li>The Hebron Municipality which is responsible for supplying
  water to the Hebron City as well as the nearly 50,000 inhabitants
  of Dura, Raboud, Abu Azja, Der Razeh, Tarrameh, Karmeh, Al-Fawwar
  and Al-'Aroub Refugee camps. The water is abstracted from two
  wells located 7 km south of Hebron City (Fawwar wells No.1&amp;2).
  </li>
 <li>The West Bank Water Department &amp; Mekorot (The Israeli
  Water Company) which are responsible for supplying water for few
  municipalities and villages in addition to the Israeli settlements
  in the district.  The water is extracted from two wells located
  in the Hebron District, Al-Samu' and Al-Rihiya.
  </li>
 <li>Those not served by any of the above mentioned water authorities
  rely on rainfall water collection in cisterns for domestic and
  agricultural use.

</ul>

 Table 4.3 below shows the results of routine chemical analysis for major cations
 and
 anions of Al-Fawwar wells which are operated by Hebron Municipality.
 Water sampling and physical water quality measurements, pH, Temperature
 (Temp) and Electrical Conductivity (EC) where conducted by the
 Applied Research Institute of Jerusalem (ARIJ) and analyzed at
 the laboratories of Abu Dies University in December, 1994.  ARIJ
 was not given access to the Mekorot wells to analyze the water
 quality.  The results of the water testing shows that all of the
 measurements fall within the international standards for drinking
 water.

<h2><font color="Black">Recommendations</font></h2>
<ul>
 <li>Distributed drinking water should be potable and should
  meet the international standards.
  </li>
 <li>Periodic quality control of water in abstraction wells,
  cisterns and distribution networks is needed.
  </li>
 <li>Drinking water distribution networks should be rehabilitated,
  and installation of new networks is very necessary in small and
  rural communities.
  </li>
 <li>Development of springs protection and management programs
  on both state and local levels, as well as the creation of an
  organizational structure to implement these programs and coordinate
  activities of the various agencies and levels is needed to cover
  the district water shortage.
  </li>
 <li>Allocation of the district water supply should be increased
  to cover the severe shortage in the district, bearing in mind
  that the proposed quantity from "Taba Agreement" will
  not solve the problem.   
  </li>
</ul>
