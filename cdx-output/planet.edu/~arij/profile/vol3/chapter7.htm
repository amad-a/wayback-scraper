<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Hebron, Al-Khalil, in full Al-Khalil Ar-Rahman (the beloved of
 God, a reference to Ibrahim), is one of the oldest continuously
 inhabited cities in the world.  Canaanite Arabs came to this area
 around 3000 B.C.  Their settlements are the foundations of many
 of the towns and villages in the Hebron District.  The villages
 of Arba-Al-Khalil, Halhoul and Carmel are some of the Palestinian
 cities whose origins are traceable to Canaanite settlements.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Originally, Hebron was known by the name of Karyat Arba.  It was
 named after a leader of an Arab tribe whose name was Arba.  He
 was of the Anakite Tribe which lived in the hills that stretch
 from Hebron to Jerusalem.  The Anakites were described by those
 who knew them as "mighty ones".
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Canaaites were visited by the Prophet Ibrahim about 1900 B.C.,
 when he came to dwell in the city.  The city was destined to contain
 his remains, and those of his family; Sara, Isaac, Rebkah, Jacob
 and Leah.  Legend has it that Adam and Eve are also buried here.
 The location of their tombs was the reason that Hebron became
 the second holiest place in Palestine for Muslims.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Al Haram Al Ibrahimi (where the Tomb of Ibrahim El Khalil is located)
 was built in the days of Herod and expanded during the Crusader
 period.  During the Mamluk period it was divided into several
 mosques, embellished with slabs of marble, colored plaster and
 inscriptions (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol3/refh.htm#r21">I.M.D.&amp; Carta 1993</a>; <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol3/refh.htm#r12">Encyclopedia
