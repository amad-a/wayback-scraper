  Socio-economic Characteristics</h2>

<h2><font color="Black">Demography and Population</font></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The estimated total population of the Hebron District is 257,691
 per the year 1994, representing 12% of the total population of
 Palestine.  The district center, Hebron City, has a population
 of approximately 85,980, representing 33% of the total population
 of the district (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol3/refh.htm#r25">PBS, 1994</a>).  According to the Hebron
 Municipality,
 the city has a population of around 123,000 people per the year
 1994. Despite the PBS underestimation of the district population
 the PBS figures are used in this volume, because population statistics
 was not conducted Since 1967.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Approximately 42% of the population of the Hebron District (108,547
 people) live in  rural areas. 5% (approximately 11,675) lives
 in refugee camps and 53% (approximately 137,467) lives in communities
 under municipalities administration (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol3/refh.htm#r26">PBS, 1994</a>).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Hebron is an agricultural marketing and trade center, with glass
 and leather manufactures.  Productive agricultural activities
 exist only in the western parts of the region where the climatic
 and soil conditions are favorable.  The eastern part of the region
 has desert-like conditions with barren steep hills, sloping towards
 the Dead Sea shores.  Except for grazing, there is a very limited
 potential for productive agricultural development.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Major industrial activities in the district include stone and
 aggregate quarrying, stone and marble cutting, tanning industry,
 manufactures a distinctive type of blue, hand-blown glass, shoes
 making and a wide range of manufacturing and processing industries.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are no figures or studies concerning the per capita Gross
 National Product (GNP) or Gross Domestic Profit (GDP) for the
 district.  According to the World Bank official statistics, the
 overall economy in Palestine is characterized by a per capita
 GNP of US$ 1,715 and a GDP of US$ 1,275 for 1991 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol3/refh.htm#r35">World
 Bank,
 1993</a>).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 According to a 1994 study, Approximately 68% of the employed persons
 have permanent jobs, 17% have seasonal jobs and 15% have part-time
 jobs. The unemployment rate (aged 16 to 59) is around 30% which
 includes all persons who don't work at all for one reason or another
 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol3/refh.htm#r3">PARC &amp; Arab Thought Forum, 1994</a>).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font color="Black">Infrastructure Services</font></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Provision of services for the district inhabitants is not limited
 to the governmental and civil administration institutions.  The
 district contains a large number of charitable and non-governmental
 organizations that fill the gaps in services that the formal institutions
 are not able to provide. <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol3/appendix2.htm">Appendix 2</a> shows the most
 important associations
 and institutions.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font color="Black">Sewage Disposal Facilities:</font></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 According to the survey conducted by ARIJ in May 1995, around
 55% of Hebron City is connected to the sewage disposal network.
 The remaining 45% depends on cesspits for sewage disposal.  There
 is no sewage collection network in any of the villages in the
 district.  The village inhabitants depend on cesspits for sewage
 disposal. In the refugee camps there is no access to a sewage
 system or collection in cesspits.  The sewage waste is carried
 away in open channels. 
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font color="Black">Piped Water Supplies:</font></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Although 82% of the population in the district has access to piped
 water, there are many problems with water quality and continuity
 of supply. During summer, people in the villages, camps and even
 in Hebron City, suffer from water shortages.  Future plans to
 Rehabilitate the networks and to increase supply rates is prepared
 by municipalities and village councils.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font color="Black">Solid Waste Disposal Services:</font></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Solid waste disposal and management is an increasing  problem
 which local authorities must address.  Solid waste can be seen
 on road sides, backyards and in open space.  The waste collected
 by municipal or village councils is deposited in open, uncontrolled
 dumps.  Nearly 78% of the solid waste is collected in the Hebron
 District, while the remaining 22% of the garbage is dumped randomly
 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol3/refh.htm#r7">ARIJ 1995</a>).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font color="Black">Electricity Services:</font></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The Israeli Electric Company (IEC) supplies the Hebron District
 with electricity. On average about 63% of households receive electricity
 on 24 hours basis.  In rural areas, electric supply is erratic
 with less than 50% of rural households receiving a 24 hours/day.
 One of the major problems faces the rural areas is the disconnection
 of electricity supply because of poor maintenance, or as a result
 of commulative bills which are not paid by the municipalities
 or village councils.  Rural communities which do not have access
 to electricity supplies are dependent on either local community
 generators or on home generators which are used by some or all
 households in the communities (Heiberg, M. and Ovensen, G. 1993).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font color="Black">Transportation and Communication:</font></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The level of infrastructure in the Hebron District varies between
 urban and rural areas.  Many of the rural communities are accessible
 only through unpaved narrow roads.  Access roads to most villages
 suffer from rapid deterioration, and internal road networks in
 some of these villages are rated as very poor.  Furthermore, the
 small and scattered village communities have poineering or road infrastructure
 (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol3/refh.htm#r10">Center for Engand Planning, 1993</a>).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Not only the roads in the district lacks proper pavement and design,
 but also poor organization and management of the traffic system;
 for example, traffic lights are not allowed by the occupation
 military laws and traffic police is not available. Three types
 of transportation services are available in the district: buses,
 taxis, and private cars.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In the urban areas approximately 24% of households have access
 to telephone network, while 7% of villages and rural areas are
 connected (Heiberg, M. and Ovensen, G. 1993). In rural areas,
 most of the time, telephones are non-functioning due to network
 problems or cables theft.
 </p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><font color="Black">Health Sector</font></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Since the onset of Israeli occupation, the Israeli military authorities
 have implemented  policies that neglected the existing governmental
 health services and led to the disintegration of health-care infrastructure
 in the territory.  The natural development of this sector was
 impeded by tight restrictions, including the denial of funds,
 the blocking of further development and the linkage of health-care
 institutions to their Israeli counterparts.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are four main branches supporting the health sector: the
 government, the private Palestinian sector, charitable and non-government
 organizations (NGO's), and  UNRWA which is directed primarily
 towards refugees.  In August 1994, the Israelis gave back responsibility
 for the health care sector to the Palestinian Authority as part
 of the agreements made in the Oslo Accords.

<h3><font color="Black">Health Services</font></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 <font color="Maroon"><b><font color="Black"><i>Primary Health Care clinics:</i></font></b></font>
 Sixty-three
 primary health
 clinics serve the Hebron District and are distributed as follows:
 Twentyfive clinics are operated by NGOs; thirty-one clinics are
 run by the public sector, and UNRWA operates seven clinics for
 the refugees (PCH, 1994).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 <font color="Maroon"><b><font color="Black"><i>Hospitals:</i></font></b></font>
 There are five hospitals in the
 Hebron District;
 two are public hospitals, one is operated by the government and
 the remaining one by NGO.  There is also a pediatric hospital
 operated by NGO's sector and two private maternity hospitals.
 Six rehabilitation centers serve Hebron District (PCH, 1994).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 There are 14 ambulances in the Hebron District, out of which 8
 belong to the Red Crescent, 3 are owned by the Patient's Friends
 Society, one belongs to the government hospital and two are owned
 by the Hebron Municipality (PCH, 1994).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 <b><font color="Black"><i>Medical and Health-Care Personnel:</i></font></b> The
 total
 number of
 human health resources in the Hebron District is: 
 </p>
<ul>
 <li>159 physicians, representing 12% of the total physicians in
  Palestine.
  </li>
 <li>125 nurses, representing 5.5% of the total number of nurses
  in Palestine.
  </li>
 <li>52 dentists representing 15% of the total dentists in Palestine.
  </li>
 <li>140 technicians representing 11% of the total number of technicians
  in Palestine (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol3/refh.htm#r1">Abu Libdeh, 1993</a>).
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font color="Black">Education Sector</font></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Since 1967 the education sector was controlled by the Israelis
 military law.  Recently, in August 1994, after the "Cairo
 Agreement" between Israel and Palestinian Authority,  the
 education sector has been the responsibility of the Palestinians.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In 1942/43, there were only two schools in the district, they
 were classified as elementary schools, one for boys and one for
 girls.  By 1966/67 the number of schools had grown to 25 this
 included governmental, UNRWA, and privately operated schools (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol3/refh.htm#r13">Encyclopedia
 Palaestina, 1994</a>).
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 According to the official Palestinian statistics for the year
 1994/95, the total number of schools in the district was close
 to 312, of which 203 are primary schools (elementary and intermediate),
 44 are secondary schools and 65 are either kindergartens or community
 colleges. These schools host close to 103,271 pupils (excluding
 universities) (<a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol3/refh.htm#r26">PBS, 1995</a>).  The following table shows
 the total
 number of pupils in the district and the distribution by education
 level and sex.

 Although governmental schools which were established after 1967
 comprise the largest sector of the school system in Hebron District,
 (there are 215 government schools, 79 private schools and 18 UNRWA
 schools), the educational system is in great need for attention
 and review.  Overcrowding in classrooms greatly affects the levels
 of both education and literacy among pupils, as shown in <a href="/planet.edu/~arij/profile/vol3/fig31.gif">figure
