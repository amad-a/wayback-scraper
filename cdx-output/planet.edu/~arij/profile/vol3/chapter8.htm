 <h2>Chapter  Eight <br>
  Wastewater</h2>
 <hr size="4" width="80%">
</center>
Raw wastewater originates from domestic and industrial sources.
The characteristic of wastewater is impacted by water consumption
rates, population density, industrial practices, and habits of
the population.  The discharge of raw wastewater can present a
major potential health hazard as it carries disease causing pathogens,
and toxic elements.  Disposal of raw wastewater mixes with seasonal
surface water, percolates into the ground and may contaminate
the groundwater.  In arid and semi-arid regions, treated wastewater
has potential for reuse for irrigation purposes.
<h2><font color="Navy"><b><font color="Black">Domestic Wastewater</font></b></font></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Domestic wastewater originates primarily from residential, commercial,
 institutional and public buildings.  Once domestic wastewater
 is discharged into the sewer, dilution and/or contamination may
 occur by added industrial wastewater and storm water.  These together
 determine the final hydraulic and waste load at the treatment
 facilities.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The amount of domestic wastewater produced per capita per day
 is usually 80-90% of water consumption.  The quantity of domestic
 wastewater produced in the Hebron District was calculated based
 on an assumption that sewage is 80% of the average water consumption,
 multiplied by the estimated population. The total annual produced
 wastewater is approximately 1.86 mcm.  
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 As is the case in the rest of the West Bank districts, water quality
 and quantity data for the Hebron District is scarce.  Few studies
 and measurements concerning the quality and quantity of wastewater
 have been conducted.  In a recent study, carried out in August
 1994 for the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and
 Reconstruction (PECDAR), wastewater samples were taken from different
 locations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including the Hebron
 District.  These samples were analyzed at the Islamic University
 in Gaza City. The results of this study revealed
 the characteristics of raw domestic wastewater in Hebron District
 (Table 8.1).

<h2><font color="Black">Industrial Wastewater</font></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Industrial wastewater is the water produced by different types
 of industries which often contains heavy metals or organic loads
 and can have a negative impact on the environment.  The major
 industries in Hebron City are: leather, tanning, shoe making,
 quarrying, and stone cutting.  The most hazardous industrial waste
 comes from the tanning industry where its discharged wastewater
 contains Chromium ions. Industrial waste water is discharged into
 the sewer system or disposed into the wadis and open spaces without
 any preliminary treatment.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font color="Black">Wastewater Disposal System</font></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Wastewater disposal constitutes a major threat to health human
 and the environment in the Hebron District.  The wastewater sector
 has been neglected in the district, and as a result, sewage is
 managed poorly.  Only 55% of the population are connected to the
 sewer system located in Hebron City, the rest of the population
 disposes of sanitary waste in cesspits and open drains.  Cesspits
 are used by all residents in the rural areas.  Open drain system
 is used by some residents in the refugee camps.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font color="Black">Cesspits</font></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Cesspits are a common alternative for wastewater disposal in the
 absence of sewage system. Cesspits are usually designed to serve
 a single household or a multiple apartment building. The volume
 of the cesspit depends on the availability of land space and the
 economic status of the owners.  They range from 5 to 25 cubic
 meter.  Cesspits are usually emptied by vacuum tankers owned and
 operated by either the municipalities, UNRWA, or the private sector.
 Contents are disposed of at any available location, in many cases,
 in the streets and wadis. Sewage is apparently disposed of without
 consideration to the natural habitat, soil fertility, groundwater,
 or built-up areas.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font color="Black">Open drains</font></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="Black">
 Open drains are most common in refugee camps, which are not served
 by a sewer system. Open drains are used at both of the district
 refugee camps, Al-Fawwar and Al-'Aroub.  Domestic wastewater and
 storm water is collected in the open drains, it then flows outside
 the camp boundaries onto unattended land without any treatment.
 Overflow of the drains is predictable, especially during the
 winter time.
 </font></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><font color="Black">Sewage network</font></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The present wastewater network in the Hebron District serves only
 50% of the Hebron City. The present network is very old and has
 many problems, such as: accumulation of solid waste from stone
 cutting factories, workshops, and slaughterhouses causes regular
 clogging and flooding of the sewer system; and the absence of
 a storm water drainage system causes overload of the network,
 which results in blockage and flooding thereby leaving stagnant
 pools at the streets.  Wastewater from the network is transferred
 through a main pipeline to the south of the city near wadi As-Samn,
 where the pumping station is installed.  It should be pumped to
 the sedimentation ponds located to the east of the city, but for
 several reasons, the pumping station is non-functioning.  The
 wastewater flows through wadi As-Samn to the south-west, impacting
 the crops, fruits and vegetables which are freely planted and
 irrigated along the sides of the wadi.  Infact, the current situation
 encourged several several farmers to utilize the flowing sewage
 in irrigating their crops along both sides of the vally.  Livestock
 also use the flowing wastewater for drinking.

<h2><font color="Black">Wastewater Treatment</font></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The main objective of wastewater treatment is to protect the environment
 from:
 </p>
<ul>
 <li>high amounts of solids;
  </li>
 <li>excessive organic matter;
  </li>
 <li>low oxygen level in the disposed wastewater;
  </li>
 <li>high concentration of nutrients (N and P);
  </li>
 <li>toxic amounts of hazardous compounds; and
  </li>
 <li>contamination with pathogenic organisms.
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 This is done in order to: 
 </p>
<ul>
 <li>prevent the environmental nuisance;
  </li>
 <li>prevent the transmission of water borne diseases;
  </li>
 <li>utilize the effluent as a highly economic water resource for
  meeting the ever-growing water demand; and
  </li>
 <li>establish or maintain a healthy aquatic habitat for flora
  and fauna.
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In the Hebron District, no treatment plant is available.  Algal
 ponds were constructed and a pump station was installed in 1988.
 As mentioned above, the pumping station was clogged after 2 months
 of operation, and from that time, the pumping station and the
 ponds have not been used.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 Simple primary treatment is performed in some of the stone cutting
 factories in the district by collecting the generated wastewater
 in adjacent ponds to allow separation of particles by natural
 settling.  The treated water is then collected from the top of
 the pond for reuse in the stone cutting process.
 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font color="Black">Environmental-Related Problems</font></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The major environmental-related problems found during the field
 survey in the district are as follows.
 </p>
<ul>
 <li>Frequent flooding of cesspits throughout the district, and
  wastewater flow in wadi As-Samn, which crosses many villages in
  the district.  There are major environmental and health problems,
  which can potentially lead to transmission of infectious diseases,
  in addition to foul odors and habitat for mosquitoes.<br>
  </li>
 <li>Absence of a storm water drainage system causes overload of
  the existing sewage network, in Hebron City, which results in
  blockage and flooding.<br>
  </li>
 <li>Contamination of groundwater aquifers and springs as a result
  of wastewater percolation from cesspits and wastewater flow in
  the wadis is possible.<br>
  </li>
 <li>Irrigation with raw wastewater is another problem found primarily
  in the Wadi As-Samn area (Photo).  This practice has great potential
  for problems because the irrigated crops including tomatoes, cauliflower,
  squash, eggplants, grapes, and other field crops, are often eaten
  fresh.<br>
  </li>
 <li>Almost all of the car oil-changing facilities in the Hebron
  District, as well as the rest of the West Bank, dispose of their
  used oil in the open fields. The disposed used oil imposes a serious
  threat to the quality of groundwater and the fertility of the
  land.
  </li>
</ul>

<p align="JUSTIFY">
 The challenge of an adequate wastewater collection and disposal
 system requires immediate attention from the authorities and official
 institutions.  Public awareness and education about the need to
 properly manage wastewater must be increased, especially among
 farmers and consumers.  The potential danger of improper sewage
 disposal to human health and welfare should be stressed.  Authorities
 must enforce regulations that require proper wastewater disposal
 by individuals, the commercial sector and industrial facilities,
 to prevent pollution. 
 </p>
<h2><font color="Black">Recommendations</font></h2>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
 To improve the existing situation the following recommendations
 are presented:
 </p>
<ul>
 <li>A professional committee in the fields of sewage, including
  specialists in hydrology, health and environmental protection,
  should be affiliated to the national administration.<br>
  </li>
 <li>Installation and upgrading of sewer systems and treatment
  facilities is needed to produce effluents meeting required standards.
  Those effluents meeting the standards can be used for irrigation
  purposes or to recharge the aquifer.<br>
  </li>
 <li>Systems and cesspits to collect rural waste should be upgraded.
  People should be educated about the proper use and management
  of the cesspits.  Disposal of waste removed from cesspits should
  be regulated to stop indiscriminate dumping.<br>
  </li>
 <li>Installation of a separate drainage system for rain water
  which discharges to a well controlled and protected area is recommended
  in order to recharge the aquifer, and/or to be used for irrigation
  purposes.<br>
  </li>
 <li>Industrial wastewater should be treated before disposal to
  the sewer network.<br>
  </li>
 <li>Open channels should be replaced by collection systems.
  </li>
</ul>
