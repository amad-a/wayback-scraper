<p>City planning is one of the tools to distribute community resources; it is a political act whenever it is performed. 
Political planning presupposes that : </p>
<ul>
<li>Resources will be distributed on a relatively equitable basis. 
</li><li>The goals of the plans will be clearly stated. 
</li><li>The entire citizenry will benefit.
</li></ul>
<p>
In Arab East Jerusalem, these principles have been flaunted: 
Distributing resources in East Jerusalem:</p>
<ul>
<a name="land"></a><li><a name="land"><b>Land take-over: </b></a>
<p>Land is the major resource of East Jerusalem and its distribution is the primary concern of the governmental planning function. Almost all of the land being distributed (estimates range from 85% to 90% of the land of East Jerusalem) belongs to the Palestinians and is being awarded through the tools of planning to the Israelis. 
A map of East Jerusalem showing the location of each government-prepared town planning schemes (TPS), will delineate the boundaries of 10 large-size neighborhood plans and 13 small-size neighborhood plans. These are scattered over the land area of East Jerusalem, separated by considerable swatches of land where no planning exists. </p>
<p>These unconnected spots on the map indicate which neighborhoods for Israelis and which for Palestinians. The large-size neighborhoods are for Jews, the small for Palestinians. </p>
<p>All of the Jerusalem neighborhoods are new, that is, they were planned on vacant land that was expropriated by the government after the 1967 war. Not one new Palestinian neighborhood has been planned in East Jerusalem since then. All of the Palestinian neighborhoods were in existence before the war, but their size has been reduced by the spot zoning plans. For example, Issawiye was 10,000 dunums [one dunum is about four acres] in size before the war; but only 666 dunums are included within the zoning plan. In other words, 9,300 dunums of land cannot be used by their Isssawiyan owners. 
None of the large swatches of unplanned land that separate one spot neighborhoods plan from another may be used by their owners. They serve as a land reservoir for future Jewish neighborhoods. This has been the case in the past and undoubtedly will also be the case in the future. A few of the many examples: unplanned land owned by residents of Beit Hanina-Shu'fat (4,400 dunums) was expropriated in 1980 for the planning and construction of the new Jewish neighborhoods of Pisgat Ze'ev; unplanned land owned by residents of Um Tuba and excluded from the boundaries of the plan for the Palestinian neighborhood were expropriated for a new Jewish neighborhood to be called Har Homa. It was approved this year (1995). The municipality keeps unplanned Palestinian land vacant until the time is ripe for expropriation. The law enables the municipality to demolish any houses built on unzoned land and the municipality is a consistent enforcer of the law, at least in East Jerusalem if not in West Jerusalem. </p>
<p>By a system of spot zoning that reduces the size of existing Palestinian neighborhoods, allocates land for new Jewish neighborhoods, and leaves large quantities of land unplanned andvacant, the land resources of East Jerusalem have been completely redistributed. Staged spot zoning made it possible for the State to achieve control of 87% of the land of East Jerusalem. In other words, during a period of only 28 years, it has been possible to effect a near complete turnaround in the matter of land control in East Jerusalem, from 1967 when the Palestinians owned approximately 90% of the land of East Jerusalem to 1995 when the Israeli government is in control of 87% of the land. The Palestinians may now live on and develop only 13.5% of the land in East Jerusalem. </p>

<a name="house"></a></li><li><a name="house"><b>How High a House? </b></a>
<p>Not only has the land itself been distributed for the benefit of one group over another, but also the benefits to be accrued from using the land have been distributed inequitably. The Town Planning and Building Law that permits designation of a variety of housing zones, ranging from low-to high-density zones (15%, 25% and 50% of the size of a building lot) is applied to Palestinian neighborhoods. By contrast, building plots in Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem have enjoyed building rights as much as 200%. </p>
<p>Similarly, building heights in Arab neighborhoods are confined to one or two stories, whereas building heights of as many as eight stories have been approved in the Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem. </p>
<p><b>Two illustrations: The municipality approved a TPS for a section of Ras el-Amud neighborhood. It provides for Jewish housing in the heart of the neighborhood, with building rights of 112% in four-story buildings; the plan for Palestinian housing in Ras el-Amud, on land that "kisses" the Jewish neighborhood, will provide 50% building rights in two stories. The new Levi neighborhood, planned on the lands of Jabal al Mukabber, was granted building rights of 185% in three-to five-story buildings. On the adjacent Palestinian lands, which are exactly alike topographically, 25% in one-story is permitted.</b></p> 
<p>Low-density housing zones in Palestinian neighborhoods of East Jerusalem prevent landowners from enjoying the economic benefits of using their land for the construction of housing for sale or rental. High-density construction in the Jewish neighborhoods reduces the cost of each housing unit and spreads the cost of infrastructure development among several families. This benefit is denied to Palestinian landowners. </p>

<a name="green"></a></li><li><a name="green"><b>Greening the Land:</b></a>
<p>Every parcel of land within the boundaries of a planned neighborhood is color-coded to indicate permissible land use. Land painted green on the planning map is designated for public open space or for the preservation of unhindered view of the landscape. It may not be used for construction. The color green predominates in most of the Palestinian neighborhood plans.<b> For example the TPS for Beit Hanina-Shu'fat assigns the color green to 3,000 dunums, or one-quarter of the land area within the spot-plan boundaries (known locally as the Blue Line).</b> The Government has recently decided to rescind this land use designation and to remove the land thus leaving it unzoned. In light of the history of unplanned Palestinian lands that have been expropriated for new Jewish neighborhoods, the residents of Beit Hanina are justifiably fearful of this change. </p>
<p>The liberal application of the color green might imply that the planners, in the best tradition of their profession, wish either to preserve existing planted areas and/or "green" others. A look at the history and processes used till now to "green" East Jerusalem belies this implication. </p>
<p>None of the land designated for open space in Palestinian neighborhood plans is in fact planted areas; on the ground they are beige rather than green. Two large open spaces in East Jerusalem that were actually "greened" have been or soon will be destroyed and the land used to build new Jewish neighborhoods: "Reches" Shu'fat, where a forest on more than 1,220 dunums was cut down and the land used to build 2,000 apartments for ultra-Orthodox Jews; "Har Homa", where another forest will be cut down to provide space for 7,500 apartments. 
Last May, "Mayor Olmert" announced his intention to build a new prison and police headquarters on land designated for open space in Beit Safafa, promising the people of Beit Safafa that the land-use designation "open space" on the remaining land will be changed to housing so that they can use their land for construction and thus be more ready to swallow the bitter pill of a prison in their neighborhood. </p>
<p>In fact, the color green is used on a spot-plan map not to "open" space but rather to "close" space. The purpose of applying green paint liberally to Palestinian neighborhood plans was publicly admitted by mayor Teddy Kollek in October 1991 during a meeting of the Municipal Finance Committee where City Council members were asked to approve an appropriation for planning a new neighborhood on land designated for open space in "Reches Shu'fat." When asked to defend the loss of 1,262 dunums of public open space, Mr. Kollek stated that the green paint was applied to the map of "Reches" Shu'fat in order to prevent Palestinian construction on the land until the time was ripe to build a new neighborhood for Jews. (This statement is recorded in the protocol of the meeting).</p>

<a name="dunum"></a></li><li><a name="dunum"><b>A Dunum Here, a Dunum There</b></a>
<p>In the Arab lands of East Jerusalem, no lot larger in size than one dunum, even though zoned for housing, may be built on before a reparcellation TPS which divides the land no larger than one dunum in size, is prepared and approved. This is true of parcels that are as little as four sq. meters larger than one dunum. This ruling does not apply to "Jewish owned" land. 
A master plan for Beit-Hanina-Shu'fat was approved in 1993. It zones 850 dunums of land for residential use. The plan stipulates that no housing may be built on this land until a detailed plan has been prepared and approved. A detailed plan was duly submitted for government approval by the municipality. The plan stipulates that no housing may be built on this land until a third plan - a reparcellation scheme - is duly submitted and approved. This reduces the size of each parcel and concentrates the land thus obtained in a single location to create new parcels for public building construction. The plan has not been approved as of this writing (April 1995) and the reparcellation scheme cannot be prepared by the landowners. The land of Beit-Hanina have been waiting for 28 years to obtain the right to use their land. The legal planning process itself has been used to deny them that right. </p>
