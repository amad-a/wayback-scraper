<h2>PALESTINE</h2>
<hr>
<p>Palestine is an emerging country with the potential to develop into a fully fledged country that matches many others who gained their independence decades ago.  Palestine is the Holy Land, its people are generous, welcoming, forgiving, they are hard workers, quick to learn, and builders.</p>

<b><p>Despite the long years of occupation, or perhaps, as some say, because of it, our people developed the resilience and the ability to withstand and overcome many challenges.  In the digital world we live in, the Palestinian people are not behind, they are conversant with the new technologies and able to adapt them to their advantage.</p>
<p>In this page our purpose is to provide essential information on Palestine, to open dialogue between us and those who agree and do not agree with what we say here, in order to contribute towards a civilized dialogue, conducive to fostering peaceful existence in the land of Palestine.</p></b>
