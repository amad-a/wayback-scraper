<b><hr><a href="main.html">Back to Main Page</a><hr>
<p>This paper was written in 1995 for the purpose of acquainting its readers with the history of Jerusalem, its past and present.  It puts the issue of Jerusalem in perspective and exposes the Israeli manipulation of the city's history by shedding light on events that occurred in the city this century.  The paper shows Israel's abuse of its occupation power to affect topographic and demographic changes on Arab East Jerusalem in order to Judaize the city - make it Jewish.  As Jerusalem is a top priority on the Palestinian agenda for the final status talks with Israel, this paper will assist the reader to understand the Palestinian position towards their city.</p>
