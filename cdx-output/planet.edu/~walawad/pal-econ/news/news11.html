<b></b><h2><b>FIRST PALESTINIAN PUBLIC DEBATE FORUM</b></h2><p></p>
Palestine Trade Centre is organising the first public debate forum on the relations between the Palestinian private and public sectors.  Participants will include Ministry of Economy and Commerce, Ministry of Industry, representatives from the World Bank, and PECDAR.
This debate forum will open the opportunity for the public sector to raise its concerns vis a vis all aspects of the economic sphere in Palestine; and will allow the private sector to prepare working papers on the current economic policies and means to improve it further in line with  developments taking place around the world.
