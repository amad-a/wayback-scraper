<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In cooperation with CARE International, and
in coordination with the Ministry of Youth and Sport and various Palestinian
NGOs, Panorama has been working on the Youth and Democracy Project since
the beginning of October 1996.&nbsp; This project is divided into phases.&nbsp;
Panorama has just entered the third phase of the project.&nbsp; The third
phase will continue until the end of June 1999.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goals of the project include, but are not limited
to the following: 1) to reach out to children and youth in order to introduce
democratic principles and values into their lives and language; 2) to introduce
democratic practices in the family and school; 3) to create a core group
of Palestinians who are committed to teaching democratic principles and
values; 4) to help mobilize Palestinian youth to take a positive and active
role in the development process through establishing a Youth Network.&nbsp;

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the focus of this article is to update readers
about activities undertaken during the Second Phase of the Project, it
is important to briefly mention the accomplishments of the first phase.&nbsp;
First phase activities include: conducting 70 workshops; ‘What is Democracy’
poster exhibition and competition; ‘Everything is on Remote Control’ theater
play performances; ‘Another Time’ music tape; and finally, the production
of 3 booklets for students, parents and teachers.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; During the second phase, Panorama conducted 59 additional
workshops, published two additional workbooks for children and parents,
and conducted a training program with the Ministry of Youth and Sport with
the aim of upgrading the officers’ skills, and started the Youth Leadership
training program.&nbsp;

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ‘Youth Leadership’ training program was undertaken
with the aim of establishing the Palestinian Youth Network.&nbsp; Seventeen
female and male youth between the ages of 15 and 18 years old were recruited
for the training program.&nbsp; This program itself consisted of 71 hours
of training.&nbsp; After the training, the Youth Network was established
and a number of activities were initiated and prepared by its members.&nbsp;
<br>These activities include the following:&nbsp;
</p><ul>
<li>
Participation in the General Palestinian Handicapped Union (GPHU) campaign
to collect signatures in order to support the law proposed by the GPHU
to the Palestinian Legislative Council</li>

<li>
Conducting research on child labor which was then published in the second
edition of the Youth Network's newsletter (lana Al-Ghad/ We Have Tomorrow)
and in Al-Quds newspaper</li>

<li>
Organizing a workshop entitled “The Political Parties, the Palestinian
Case: Where To?” where three national figures from the three main political
parties spoke.&nbsp; Almost 80 people attended this 3 ½ hours&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Preparing the ‘Palestinian Youth in Pictures and Words’ photo exhibition
which included 67 photos of female and male Palestinian youth and summary
sheets about the 67 youths’ opinion on the role of youth, youth's dreams
and problems, etc.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third phase of the project consists of similar activities
to the ones conducted in the past two phases.&nbsp; Panorama will continue
to offer workshops on democracy to youth between the ages of 11-15 years
old, to parents and to teachers.&nbsp; In addition, Panorama will conduct
two more youth leadership training program in other regions.&nbsp; The
youth who participate will then join the Palestinian Youth Network&nbsp;</td>
