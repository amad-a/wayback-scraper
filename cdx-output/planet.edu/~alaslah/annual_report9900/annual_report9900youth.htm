Wi'am recognizes that the youth are a vital part of the Bethlehem community and
therefore is engaged with investing in them as a group, by building cordial
relationships. Through learning about non-violence and mediation techniques, the
youth play a key role in helping to prevent conflicts in the community.<br>
<br>
Volunteerism is a doctrine that Wi'am has adopted since its inception. We have
conducted a lot of voluntary activities ranging from cemetery cleaning, public
services, helping build community centers, preparing for the Pope's visit,
hospital visiting, cultural activities, helping children, and responding to the
needs of the local community.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
At the beginning of 1999, Wi'am began a program for the youth called, "Know
Your Country". Many of the youth in the Bethlehem area have never or very
rarely been able to see and know much of Palestine because of the restrictions
on movement imposed by the Israeli government. A part of the aim for the project
was to allow the youth a chance to expand their knowledge of the land, their
history, their culture and traditions. But, Palestinians are not the only ones
who live in the land, so it was also a way for them to get to know and slowly
understand others who live in the land. Hopefully through knowing and
understanding it will help create neighbors. The project had lots of success
with trips to Solomon Pools, Jericho, Haifa, Jerusalem, and Tiberias. Besides
from their educational aspect, these trips offered the youth an insight into
life beyond the abnormal they are accustomed to in the West Bank.&nbsp;

Another area is the ecumenical movement of Wi'am youth. This group has been
active in arranging lectures, panels, and workshops to enhance the spirit of
ecumenism and pluralism in the Palestinian youth. Such a group has enhanced
dialogue with the religious leadership aimed at strengthening the ties between
laity and the religious establishment. It has furthered the importance of
openness and the spirit of inclusivity and democracy.<br>
<br>
<b>
Wi'am youth have been active at different levels:&nbsp;</b>
</p><ol>
<li>It strengthens the roots of
the youth and so they work on the grassroots level targeting political, social,
economic, and religious activities.</li>
<li>It enhances the cross-cultural youth
activities. So we have our youth ambassadors in workshops, conferences, and
visits to the USA, Norway, Germany, Canada, Sweden, England, and Latin America.</li>
<li>The cross-generational activities through activism between the youth of the
heart and the youth of the age, helps to build community and strengthen ties.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Through networking with other organizations, Wi'am has been actively involved in
the Youth Action Plan. It is a program bringing youth together from Norway,
Sweden, Israel, and Palestine in an exchange dialogue about Human Rights.&nbsp;<br>
