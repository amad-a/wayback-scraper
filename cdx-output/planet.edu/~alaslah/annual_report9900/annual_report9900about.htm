<p align="left">"The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step." (Lao Tse)<br>
<br>
Known as "Wi'am" in Arabic (which means 'cordial relationships' or
'harmony') the Center helps to resolve disputes within the Palestinian community
by complementing the traditional Arab form of mediation called Sulha, with
Western models of conflict resolution.<br>
<br>
Wi'am began its formal efforts between the years of 1994 and 1995, in the homes
of its founder and with the help of many volunteers. It was said, 'all that was
needed- was a place and a phone'. Wi'am conducted many a Sulha from the friendly
confines of their private homes, some early in the morning and some late in the
evening. Wi'am soon grew beyond the capacity of homes and moved into an office
on Manger Street. It transformed what once was an apartment, into a three-room
office. We have converted the fourth room into a meeting area for workshops and
training.<br>
<br>
Wi'am mediators have intervened in over 3,000 conflicts. In about 80% of these
cases, hostilities were ended and the dispute was substantially resolved. Since
these conflicts frequently involve clans and extended families, thousands of
people have benefited directly and indirectly from the work of the Center.<br>
<br>
As Wi'am's involvement in conflicts became ever more present and in demand, it
was seen fit to take a more pro-active role in preventing conflicts. Along with
direct mediation, Wi'am has taken on the role of training individuals in the
community to resolve conflicts- and to be aware about human rights and democracy
issues. Resolving and preventing conflicts has become a community effort,
involving families, youth, and the local government. Disputes can be diminished
through cooperation and education.&nbsp;<br>

<br>
Wi'am as a grassroots organization, strives alongside other democratic forces
present in the larger Bethlehem community to build a democratic and just
society. The Center aims to improve the quality of relationships by: addressing
injustices rather than avenging them; dignifying persons on both sides of the
conflict; promoting human rights and advocating for peace among all people.<br>
