Although Wi'am mainly focuses on Palestinians in the Bethlehem area, we have
also participated and partnered with Israeli groups who try to promote peace and
understanding through dialogue and interaction. Our newest project is an
Interfaith project called "Track II &amp; III Anti-Incitement through
violence prevention by Emerging Leadership". For this project, we have
partnered with the Catholic Relief Services and the Harry S. Truman Institute
for Peace (Hebrew University).<br>

Reflection written by Lucy Thaleigh, Women's Coordinator, about her experience
at EMU.<br>
<br>
I became more aware and familiar with the basic literature available in the
field of conflict resolution, understanding conflict, definitions, and dynamics
of communication and the negotiation process. The course I took are used to
promote accurate international awareness regarding the identity, presence and
witness, while encouraging groups from around the world to work for justice,
comprehensive, and enduring peace, informed by truth and empowered by prayer and
action.<br>
<br>
<b>
<a name="People to People Workshop">
People to People Workshop</a></b><br>
During the ongoing dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians, it has been
decided to hold joint workshops. In general, these workshops are designated for
Israelis who place themselves in the center of the political spectrum,
especially new immigrants, moderate religious groups, and residents of
development towns and neighborhoods with certain&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
leadership abilities or potential. The Palestinians are from different domains
(students and working youngsters), so as to discuss the Israeli - Palestinian
conflict and dialogue on one hand, and on the other, to promote maximum
interchange, interaction, peace values and mutual understanding between the
participants. Concentration is placed on final status issues: Jerusalem,
refugees, and settlements.<br>
<br>
Wi'am has trained over 100 volunteers in conflict mediation - use of Sulha,
various other mediation methods, and the application of these techniques. Wi'am
is instrumental in sponsoring educational and awareness workshops. Last year we
conducted workshops for:

<p><img border="0" src="/planet.edu/~alaslah/annual_report9900/community_meeting.jpg" width="264" height="170" align="right">Wi'am has also conducted in-service training for those interested in Sulha.
In-service training is provided so individuals can have a hands-on, practical
learning experience without feeling as though they have been thrown into the
lion's den all alone. Individuals are asked to be a part of Sulha by observing
what is said and done. After the Sulha meeting concludes, Wi'am staff sits down
with the trainees to evaluate the Sulha process.&nbsp;<br>
