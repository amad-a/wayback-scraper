I wondered why someone did not do something about peace. Then I realized I was
somebody. (an)<br>
<br>
Sulha practice has been present in Middle Eastern cultures since ancient times.
It had its historic emergence in early Semitic writings and in later Christian
records dating from the first century, A.D. It continued in Arabic desert
culture and literature through the pre-Islamic period (Jahiliyah) and the common
historic era. Sulha met the test of time because it is based on common legal
principles and collective wisdom recognized within pluralistic communities and
formed across religious, political and ethnic differences.<br>
<br>
The Sulha of today has adapted to the contexts of modern life. Wi'am employs
Sulha as an addition to, rather than replacement of, the civil and criminal law
practiced by the state; while under tribal law, it was once the only means for
passing and enforcing rulings. Nevertheless, the underlying purposes have
remained the same through the centuries: restoration of peaceful relationships
between individuals, families, family groups and villages, and the redressing of
wounds between disputing parties.<br>
<br>
Arabic tradition holds that, "Nobody can carry blood, it is so heavy. Even
the earth cannot absorb [it]... It will remain a stain" (Jabbour, 1996).
Conflicts, which in the most severe cases result in assault, physical injury or
homicide, leave a "stain" on the community, and so it is understood
that no member of the community can spill blood with impunity. Thus, in order to
prevent acts of revenge and disastrous feuds, the elements of Sulha have been
employed as a means to redress conflict.<br>
<br>
The success or failure of the mediation effort in Palestinian society falls
squarely on the shoulders of the Jaha, the delegation of community leaders
recruited to mediate the conflict. It is a role demanding the utmost in
sensitivity, patience, communication, attention to detail, and sense of justice.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A Wi'am mediator is uniquely trained to serve the community in this archetypal
role of Peacemaker. The Jaha has served each generation of Palestinian society
not only as a mediator in incidental conflicts, but as a model of community
peacemaking. And the chaos in Palestinian life with the Israeli occupation has
made the need for this traditional body all the more acute.<br>
<br>
Wi'am integrates the traditional Arabic form of reconciliation, Sulha, with
contemporary western mediation techniques. As a conflict emerges, mediators
respond by going to the scene of a conflict. Their purpose is to bring the
conflicting parties together while saving face, to address the wrong, and to
create relationships between the disputants and Wi'am's mediators. Since 1994,
Wi'am has intervened in about 3,000 cases ranging from personal conflict,
conflict over land, to domestic violence. The problems handed to us were well
treated and solved. The Center successfully mediated around 80% of the
conflicts. Especially in the second part of the year, the number of domestic
incidents and other kinds of violence increased - mirroring the growing
frustration and impatience of people due to the abnormal life conditions in the
West Bank.<br>
