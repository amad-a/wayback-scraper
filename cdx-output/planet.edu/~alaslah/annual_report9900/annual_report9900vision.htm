<br>
Although Wi'am has found success over the last year, the Center is not without
faults and challenges where improvements and development can be made.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Resolving conflicts using Sulha will remain a vital part of the work for Wi'am
throughout the years to come. Because of the number of confrontations and
arguments due to the tense political situation, people from the Center have been
overwhelmed with work. This increase in demand for our Center's help shows a
need for more mediators.&nbsp;<br>
To recruit more mediators we plan to conduct various training in conflict
resolution. The training will be for two purposes; to train volunteers with
Wi'am, and train individuals in the community to develop the skills necessary to
resolve their own conflicts.<br>
<br>
In the upcoming years Wi'am would like to take a more active role in the local
schools by creating an in depth Peace Education program. Wi'am staff,
volunteers, and resource people would facilitate programs working with both
younger and older students. By the end of the year, the goal would be for
college students from the university to be actively involved with the younger
students.<br>
<br>
Some of the topics that would be addressed throughout the year include:
Self-Esteem, Internal Conflict/Identity, Gender Issues and Roles, Relationships,
Decision Making, Listening Skills, Peer Mediation, and Leadership skills. Many
times these topics are dismissed from the classroom. Often the classroom only
focuses on academics, and forgets that the biggest classroom is the 'Classroom
of Life'. Young people need to be given some type of knowledge in this area for
a foundation in understanding, accepting, and questioning things of everyday
life.<br>
<br>
Another area which Wi'am would like to expand is in the interest of women. The
Palestinian society is traditionally patriarchal in nature, but things have
begun to change. In the past couple of years Wi'am had started to work with
women, but projects still need to expand to address more of the needs and reach
more people. Conflicts between women are still being resolved by their male
relatives and neighbors. Wi'am has already conducted training for women, but we
feel that a new method where women can take control needs to be developed. In a
society that is changing this will be very important.<br>
<br>
The vision of Wi'am is to continue to grow and lead by being humble, listening
to the people, understanding the concerns, and always being ready to learn.
Along with more mediators, Wi'am will have to hire more qualified individuals to
support the ongoing and expanding programs. To reach the many conflicts and
workshops, the office will need to purchase a vehicle to meet these needs.<br>
