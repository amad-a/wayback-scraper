fools." (Martin Luther King Jr.)<br>
<br>
The continued deadlock in the 'Peace Process' reflects very clearly in some of
our cross-cultural projects. The deteriorating conditions in the West Bank
resulted in increasing reluctance among a considerable part of the Palestinian
population to participate in joint activities with the Israeli side. This posed
the challenge to Wi'am of how to proceed with these efforts, when listening to
the concerns of people from our community, but also to follow our belief in the
necessity of working together for an inevitable common future. In one of our
projects, it took us two months of shuttle diplomacy to write a joint article on
the situation of the Palestinian political prisoners, that at the end, doesn't
say much, we feel. However, it was a good learning experience of how difficult
it is to arrive to acceptable compromises in situations of great power
imbalance.<br>
<br>
Through some of the cross-cultural activities, Wi'am was not afraid of taking
the risk of trying new techniques. Through guided discovery of the creative
energies that lie hidden in individuals trapped in everyday struggle under the
tense political situation, people broke out from conventional ways of thinking.
They dared searching for alternative options of the reality here in the West
Bank.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Over the past year Wi'am has been working on a project with the Truman Institute
called H.E.A.L.- Healing Early Action Link. Its purpose has been to bring
individuals on both sides together beyond dialogue. Its hope is to have people
walking in the shoes of the other, learning empathy and understanding. Its
current focus is attending to the issue of the Palestinian Political Prisoners.
We will issue a training manual for trauma healing.<br>
<br>
Anti-Incitement through cross-cultural workshops has been a project we have been
involved in over the past year. In cooperation with the Catholic Relief Services
and the Truman Institute for Peace (Hebrew University), we have brought young
adults together to focus on ethno-religious conflict resolution through
anti-incitement and aggression prevention and preemption. Students who
participate will produce a manual, and help in establishing a new NGO to work in
this field.<br>
