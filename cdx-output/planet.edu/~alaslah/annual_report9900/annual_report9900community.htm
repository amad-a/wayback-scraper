<br>
Over the last 6 years Wi'am has committed itself to be a gift giver. This year
had been one filled with smiles on the faces of children. Near the end of
November 1999, Wi'am began the campaign of raising funds. Generous donations
were received from many loving hearts around the world. A few days before
Christmas, staff members and volunteers went out to purchase gifts from
different stores. After Christmas and into the New Year, staff and volunteers
went to homes and distributed the gifts directly with Santa to needy families.
Children jumped with joy as Santa came to visit them. Smiles glowed from ear to
ear; not only on the children's faces, but on their parent's faces as well. As
visitations sojourned from house to house, parents also joined in the
celebrations of giving.<br>
<br>
Over 1,000 children were visited in the Bethlehem area during this celebration.
Many volunteers gave of their time to purchase gifts, organize, and distribute
them with the use of their own cars. Children of volunteers also rejoiced in the
spirit of giving to other children.<br>
<br>
Along with the gifts given to children, Wi'am made some special visits to
families. Families needing blankets or extra funds to cover rent and heat were
received with warm hearts by staff and volunteers.<br>
<br>
While resolving interpersonal conflicts, personal social issues become apparent.
Wi'am, when possible, tried to address these needs. Sometimes it only involved
sitting down and listening, while other times it took getting involved with the
family. The social cases varied in nature, but all revolved around basic needs.
Wi'am distributed a small amount of funds to individuals and families who had
certain needs. The money went to pay bills, rent, food, school fees- or anything
else that was needed. This little amount of money may have just been the amount
to prevent a huge conflict from forming and help families whom otherwise may not
have been able to survive.&nbsp;<br>
