is keep us out of war" (Maria Montessori)<br>
<br>
Wi'am recognizes that there are no borders to conflicts and no borders to peace.
The doors of the Center are open for visitors to come and learn about the work
of Wi'am and the conditions Palestinians live under. Through learning at the
Center they are able to understand a little better about the people and issues
than listening or reading the news. Many visiting groups from abroad ask to meet
with the staff of Wi'am. Over the last year, the Wi'am staff met with over 20
medium to large groups, and over 10 small delegations. Talking with the groups
is an important project for the Center, to be able to share experiences and tell
family stories.<br>
<br>
Along with opening our doors to share, Wi'am has also been involved with setting
up group itineraries when asked. Because of Wi'am's work in the community, we
have been able to develop many contacts in the local community as well as
networks with other organizations throughout Palestine. This allows the staff to
set meetings and trips for groups who are interested in learning more about the
Palestinian situation. Throughout the year Wi'am hosted two groups in this
fashion.<br>
<br>
"If we cannot end our differences, at least we can make the world safe for
diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all
inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our
children's future. And we are all mortal." (John F. Kennedy)<br>
