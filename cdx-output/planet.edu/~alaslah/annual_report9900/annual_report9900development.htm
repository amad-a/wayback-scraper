Relations abroad provide models of how other societies solve their internal
conflicts, and also allow for gaining a different perspective on the Palestinian
situation through looking at it from the 'outside'. Last year, various members
of the Center participated in conferences and training in Europe, United States,
and the Middle East- while others visited both the United States and Canada.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Wi'am has hosted two interns from the United Methodist Church's General Board of
Global Ministries (GBGM). Through their Mission Intern Program, they have been
able to help the center in it's advocacy work, disseminating information to
contacts around the world about the situation on the ground, and the projects
and seminars taking place at the center. The valuable experiences they have in
the center allow them to better understand the situation of the Palestinian
community in the Bethlehem area. Upon their return to the United States, they
are able to continue their work to promote truths about the situation they
witness on a first-hand basis during their time spent working at the center.<br>
<br>
Peacequest in Sweden hosted two youth from the Center for training on conflict
resolution, democracy, and human rights. Another youth visited Swedish schools
with an Israeli youth to talk about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Later in
the year, Wi'am sent a youth to participate in a six month course focusing on
'Peace Studies'.<br>
<br>
Five people from Wi'am, together with other youth from Jordan, Syria, Iraq, and
Lebanon participated in workshops on conflict mediation and peacemaking
organized by MECC in Cyprus, followed by a sequel in Lebanon. They learned
skills in leadership development, and youth empowerment. Participants were
introduced to new methods of conflict mediation through models from Sudan and
Egypt ("Rubbish City"). Our colleagues returned to Wi'am reenergized
by not only the newly acquired knowledge, but also by the new web of friendships
woven during the conference providing them with continuos support and window to
the world outside Palestine.<br>
<br>
As a response to the visit of Native Americans to Palestine, a delegation from
Wi'am traveled to the Native American reservations of Pine Ridge (South Dakota),
Hollow Water (Winnipeg), Chechashite (Labrador). They visited families, shared
stories and cultures. While learning about the similarities between the history
of Palestinians and Native Americans, both felt the need for further
collaboration and support of each other.<br>
<br>
In March, the director participated in a conference in Ireland, entitled
Researching Violent Societies, where he gave a lecture on the new trend among
Israeli historians to rewrite history. Later that same month, he joined a group
of doctors from the United States, England, Australia, and Canada (International
Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War) to Iraq to bring medicine and
books for the medical schools and children affected by the sanctions. As he put
it, "I was shocked by the number of children&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
suffering from malnutrition, by the sight of so many children affected by the
use of chemical weapons. In one of the hotels we stayed in Baghdad, people asked
for milk for their children, and I felt guilty that I didn't bring any with
me." Despite these severe conditions, he was pleasantly surprised by the
religious pluralism existing in Iraq.<br>
