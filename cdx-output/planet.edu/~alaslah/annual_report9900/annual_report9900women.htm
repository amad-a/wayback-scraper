Wi'am recognizes the importance of women in the society. As the times are
changing and gender roles are being re-examined, Wi'am has taken a role to help
through training and personal support. Women are trained in conflict resolution,
so they can take an active role in resolving conflicts that arise around them.
Local outreaches to village residents are undertaken to build a community of
support. Educational sessions are held about 'Family Planning' and raising
children. Women are also encouraged to further pursue their educational studies.<br>

Women's movements need to develop their own culture and identity, and people can
get strength through identifying with the group. When oppressed groups can
reclaim their identity, redefining it in a positive way, it is an important step
in the process of empowerment.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
During the year, Wi'am did many training workshops, focusing on Women's Issues:
</p><ul>
<li>Violence &amp; Non-violence</li>
<li>Gender &amp; Development</li>
<li>Women &amp; Constitution</li>
<li>Violence against women</li>
<li>Methods of Conflict Resolution</li>
<li>Introducing the concepts &amp; practice of Conflict Resolution</li>
<li>Use of Media in Human Rights</li>
<li>Women in the Political Level</li>
<li>Leadership Skills</li>
<li>Political Activism &amp; Social Action</li>
<li>Women's Networking</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="/planet.edu/~alaslah/annual_report9900/march.jpg" width="230" height="157">
</p><p>Through our workshops we are trying to achieve total equality between men and
women in all aspects of the development process, as well as working towards
building a democratic Palestinian state that provides dignity, security, safety,
and justice.<br>
<br>
Since the Wi'am Center is not isolated by itself, but working in a community,
other staff members work diligently to network with 15 other women's
organizations. This helps to consolidate efforts, share resources, as well as
provide a support network.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"We cannot live for ourselves alone. Our lives are connected by a thousand
invisible threads, and along these sympathetic fibers, our actions run as causes
and return to us as results" (Herman Melville).<br>
