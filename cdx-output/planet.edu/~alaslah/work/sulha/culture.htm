<center><font size="4">The 'Culture' of Sulha</font></center>

<p><i>Conflict Resolution- Is an artwork of sharing yourself: your heart, your soul, your spirit, your knowledge, your wisdom, your time, your generosity, your understanding, and your experiences with others.</i> 
</p><p>
The Arab Culture is a 'Culture of Face'.  The Arab community is traditionally small with neighbors knowing each other quite well.  Relationships and reputations are continually talked about.  Resolving disputes using Sulha, is a process to 'Save the Face' of those involved.   Saving the face is a constructive approach for preserving each other's dignity.  Humiliation has no room. Each case is approached individually, on its own accord.  The aim in one case might be the quality of the relationship, while the aim in another case might be the actual solution.  Through a mediation process a win-win situation building a healthy relationship is desired, unfortunately some cases require the use of arbitration to come to a just solution. 
</p><p>
Sulha has been a part of Arab Culture for thousands of years.  Christian, Jewish, and Muslim Arabs all used Sulha to resolve their disputes.  This method put an end to conflict favoring 'arms of dialogue, to dialogue of arms'.  Within the process and tradition, are various elements and rituals.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<p></p><li><b>3 Resources</b> - When one of the two parties goes to the other to reconcile the dispute, resources are needed: Human Resources (bringing respected members of the community), Financial Resources (money to pay for the wrongs committed), and the Contrition.
<p></p><p>
</p></li><li><b>Circle</b> - The gathering of the disputing parties takes place in a circle where everyone is able to see everyone else.  This way everyone is on equal footing, although only a few of the people may actually speak.
<p></p><p>
</p></li><li><b>Story Telling</b> - It is another prophetic approach learned from the prophets in giving a message and urgency of solving the conflict.  Storytelling is a creative technique for brainstorming new ways of maneuvering, bargaining, and diplomacy.  The respected elders for each side may use these stories to relate the discussion to the dispute.  These stories may come from folktales or from personal past experiences.
<p></p><p>
</p></li><li><b>Tying the Knot</b> - Respected witnesses join the disputing parties in knotting a ceremonial cloth, symbolizing the making of peace and fresh relational ties.
<p></p><p>
</p></li><li><b>Coffee</b> - The bitter Arabic coffee used to be cooked in the middle of the circle.   It is still a sign of reconciliation.  When the two sides come to an agreement, they drink coffee as a sign that things are settled.  It is the highest ritual for reconciliation after the acknowledgement of mistakes, crimes, or assaults.
<p></p><p>
</p></li><li><b>Meal</b> - Eating together would be another sign that the relationship has been healed.  There would be breaking of bread (a sign of sharing), and pouring of salt (a sign that the relationship is preserved and the agreement will be everlasting).
<p></p>

<p><i>We are like an Olive Tree, with roots fastened deep in the ground and branches that reach out to the world.  Our words produce more than sound; they walk tall to the corners of the world.  For some, the day-to-day activities are only part a job, but here- it is a commitment to serve and enrich the community relationships, being a part of the future.</i></p>
