<center><font size="5"><b><i>Sulha - - Examples of Resolved Conflicts</i></b></font></center>


<p><i>
The following are just generic examples provided to illustrate how the traditional Sulha is currently being integrated with Western Techniques.  Actual cases cannot be discussed because of the confidential nature of each case.</i></p>
<hr align="CENTER" size="1" width="100%">

<p><i>Sulha Example #1</i>
</p><p>
<b>Win - Win</b>
</p><p>
A car from an outside village collided with a car from Bethlehem inside the city limits of Bethlehem.  Upon getting out of his car, the man from village started calling the woman driver dirty names.  Afterwards, he drove away from the accident before the police could reach the scene.  He was identified by witnesses and later caught.  
</p><p>
The man would not apologize for his actions and was reluctant to participate in a Sulha.  Through an outside individual, he was reminded of the importance of adhering to the tradition. 
</p><p>
A delegation was therefore sent to the victim's house.  A group of friends, neighbors, and relatives acted in representation for the victim.
</p><p>
The delegation came bearing in mind an <u>Acknowledgement Truce</u>.  They said that they are responsible and are willing to pay for the damages caused.  After this Truce was called, a <u>Healing Truce</u> was put forth.  This meant that the Sulha would continue when the wounds were healed. 
</p><p>
When the Sulha took place again, the delegation was ready to give the victim money beyond the amount needed for the medical and car costs.   The victim's family refused to take the money out of good faith.   Instead, they shared; ethical thoughts, bitter coffee, and shook hands before going home. 
</p>

<br>
<p><i>Sulha Example #2</i></p>

<p><b>Zero - Sum</b></p>
<p>
For over 6 years a Palestinian couple had been engaged for marriage.  There had been some trouble along the way, but the couple had agreed to seek counseling.  The young lady's parents had started to accuse the young man, unjustly, of doing horrible things.  They continued to bad mouth him, causing the young lady's relatives to attack the soon to be groom.  After this, the young man's family no longer wanted the young lady to marry their son.
</p><p>
The young lady's family was not ready for a Sulha. An <u>Investigative Truce</u> was called to give the mediation delegation time to discover the issues.  After the boys were released from jail, they wanted to solve their differences through Sulha. It was up to them to bring a delegation with the following: material resources, human resources, and an apology. 
</p><p>
The material resources were to cover the hospital costs, lawyer costs, the humiliation, and the violations of tradition.  The delegation for the offenders were reluctant to pay these costs.  With careful mediation back and forth over time, the two sides were able to come to an agreement.  Instead of shaking hands, the two sides wrote the agreement down and signed together.
