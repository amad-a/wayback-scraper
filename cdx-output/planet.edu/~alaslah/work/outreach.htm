<p><font size="4">Shoe Distribution -1999</font></p>
<p>Near the end of April, Wi'am worked in partnership with World Vision to distribute over a thousand pairs of tennis shoes to children in the Bethlehem, Beit Sahour, Beit Jala, Ramallah, and Jerusalem areas. This included some outlining villages and also some families from the refugee camps. Many of the families were given between 2-4 pairs of shoes for their children.  The goal was to reach as many needy families as possible, but along the way the giving showered down on others who may not be considered so needy.</p>

<p>Some quotes by some of the children and parents include:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Oh, Its Christmas again!"<br>
</li><li>"They always focus on kids, what a better message we need!"<br>
</li><li>"Can I take one to my cousin?  I'm not sure the size, maybe 20, 30, 40- but can I take one?" - 5 year old<br>
</li></ul>
<p><a name="smiles"><font size="4">Smiles in Bethlehem - 1998</font></a></p> 

<p>In recent years there has not been a whole lot to smile about here in the West Bank. Living conditions have continued to worsen, while hopes have slowly disappeared as discouragement is on the rise.</p> 

<p>Christ was born into this world of unfavorable conditions almost 2000 years ago in this very city of Bethlehem.  He was but a young babe, a child in a manger, bringing a gift to the world.  He brought- -  a gift of Hope- a gift of Love- and a gift filled with Smiles to the children of this world.</p>

Wi'am over the last 5 years has continued to be a gift giver.This year has been one filled with smiles on the faces of children.Near the end of November, Wi'am began the campaign of raising funds.  Generous donations were received from many loving hearts around the world.  A few days before Christmas, staff members and volunteers went out to purchase gifts from different stores.  After Christmas and into the New Year, staff and volunteers have gone to homes and distributed the gifts directly with Santa to need families. Children jumped with joy as Santa came to visit them.  Smiles glowed from ear to ear; not only on the children's faces, but on their parent's faces as well.  As visitations sojourned from house to house, parents also joined in the celebrations of giving.<p></p> 
<br>
<p>Over 850 children have been visited in the Bethlehem area during this celebration.  Many volunteers have given of their time to purchase gifts, package gifts, and distribute gifts with the use of their own cars.  Children of volunteers have also rejoiced in the spirit of giving to other children.</p> 

<p>Along with the gifts given to children, Wi'am made some special visits to families.  Families needing blankets or extra funds to cover rent and heat were received with warm hearts by staff and volunteers.</p> 
                     
<p>Christmas spirit of giving and forgiveness has truly come alive in Bethlehem.  Wi'am hopes to carry this spirit into the New Year and throughout its service to the community.</p>
<p></p><center>Christmas is not only one day, but a new way.</center><p></p>
<p>
<a name="social"><font size="4">Social Cases</font></a></p>
<p>
While resolving interpersonal conflicts, personal social issues become apparent. Wi'am, when possible, tries to address these needs.  Sometimes it may only involve sitting down and listening, while other times it may take getting involved with the family.</p>
<p>
Getting involved pertains to listening, helping out with unpaid bills, and with locating resources and contacts to other services.
