<p>
In the middle of August, A member of Wi'am is joining a group of Palestinians going to Oklahoma in the United States.  Last Fall, a large tornado took outs its wrath on parts of Oklahoma causing much damage.  For 10 days, the Palestinians will be working with locals to continue the cleanup and rebuilding.  It is a way of extending the relationship to reach out to others who are also in need of help.</p>

</a><p><a name="sweed">At the beginning of 1999, Wi'am took part in a study abroad program.  We sent one of our college youth to Sweden to participate in an international peace study program. He recently returned at the beginning of July with warm insights from his experience.  This exchange is a part of the cooperation that began some years back with groups in Sweden.  Last Summer Wi'am sponsored a Palestinian youth to talk about local issues to students in various schools.  She represented Palestine along with a youth representing Israel. Shortly after she returned, 2 youth from Wi'am participated in a youth conference held in Sweden.</a><a href="/planet.edu/~alaslah/work/sweden.htm">Personal Reflection</a></p>

<p>Between June and July, a few staff members and volunteers ventured off to North America.  They spent a great deal of time building relationships with the Native Americans of Canada, while also spending a little time with Native Americans in Northern United
States.  They were able to attend conferences and spend time with Native American families.  Time was spent sharing stories and exchanging cultures.</p> 

<p>On reflections- close connections of the plight of Native Americans were easily related to the current situation of Palestinians.

<p><a name="haifa"><font size="4" "="">Wi'am Bus Trip to Haifa -- Oct 2, 1998</font></a></p><a name="haifa"> </a>

<p>There was an open house for the new Catholic Bishop who was to be serving from Haifa. Wi'am planned an excursion to take people from Bethlehem to personally welcome the new Bishop.</p>

<p>At 12 noon people started to fill up the bus.  There were children, there were mothers, there were fathers, there were grandparents, and there was even a priest.  In all, there were 50 people loaded on the bus for the 3½-hour ride.</p>

<p>In leaving Bethlehem, the bus had to make its way through the Israeli checkpoint.  As expected, the bus was stopped in order that everyone's documents could be inspected.  Out of the 50 people, only 6 had permission papers to leave the West Bank into 'Israel Proper'. 
The soldiers boarded the bus asking to see IDs and papers.  Only those in the front had proper documentation, all others only had their IDs to show the soldiers.  The soldiers went down the aisle looking at all the IDs, not knowing what to do with a bus full of people who did not have proper identification.  As the soldiers got off, the bus pulled away toward Jerusalem with spirited singing and loud music.</p>

<p>After many joyous moments of singing, everyone on the bus calmed down to enjoy the ride to Haifa.  Once arriving in Haifa, before visiting with the Bishop, the bus stopped off at a church.  It was a time used for personal prayer and meditation.  Across from the church there was a wonderful view of the Mediterranean Sea. It was good to stretch the legs and see across the horizon without a soldier or checkpoint in site.  Moving on from the church,
the bus headed toward the Bishop's house.  Upon entering, everyone shook the Bishop's hand in a welcoming gesture.  A representative from Wi'am then proceeded to give the Bishop a plaque, symbolizing the extension of faith, and friendship.  The entire exchange of
support lasted for a mere five minutes before another group came in welcoming fashion.</p>

<p>The mothers, fathers, and children together loaded back on the bus for the ride back to Bethlehem.  Loud music played throughout the bus, while men and women sang along expressing their joys.  On the ride back, it was agreed upon to spend some time in Jaffa. 
Families and friends visited under the moonlit sky of the Mediterranean.  Some took walks through the city, some took the fresh air in with every breath, and others found places to
eat and talk.  After some peaceful moments in Jaffa, it was time to return to Bethlehem.</p>

<p>The bus pulled up to the checkpoint outside of Bethlehem shortly after nine in the evening. Soldiers motioned for the bus to stop.  Once again the soldiers took their place asking for
permits and IDs.  This time a handful of men without papers were told to get off the bus. There was confusion over one of the men and his identity.  It was almost a cat and mouse game of getting off the back and getting back on the front.  Women on the bus were in
hysterical laughter over the confusion.  The soldier seemed to have gotten frustrated and embarrassed with the whole situation and therefore let the other men back on the bus.</p>

<p>Visiting the Bishop for just a few minutes was wonderful for the Christian community of Bethlehem to come together in spirit, faith, and message of freedom. The trip in part was a non-violent struggle resisting the Israeli occupation.  There are great risks for individuals who go outside the West Bank without the proper identification showing that they are allowed.  Individuals may be arrested, where they may have to pay a fine, or even harsher
consequences of physical and mental abuse.</p>

<p>The trip was a non-violent demonstration for the freedom of the Palestinian people by families in the community.</p>

<p>Wi'am is currently involved with the Canada Park Project- known as<br> Flashback for the Future. It is an experiment in reconciliating history.</p>
