In the upcoming months, Wi'am will be hosting a conflict resolution course for the youth in Palestine.  An expert in the traditional <i>Sulha</i> will be teaching this technique. It will be a way for the college age youth to learn about the Arab traditions and customs of the culture when it comes to resolving conflicts.  The Center's director will also share insights into techniques used in the Western societies.</p>

<p>
At the beginning of 1999, Wi'am began a program for the youth called, "Know Your Country".  Many of the youth in the Bethlehem area have never or very rarely been able to see and know much of Palestine because of the restrictions on movement imposed by the Israeli government.  A part of the aim for the project was to allow the youth a chance to expand their knowledge of the land, their history, their culture and traditions.  But, Palestinian Christians are not the only ones who live in the land, so it was also a way for them to get to know and slowly understand others who live in the land.  Hopefully through knowing and understanding it will help create neighbors.  The project had lots of success at first with trips to: Solomon Pools, Jericho, and Tiberias.  Unfortunately there have not yet been enough funds to continue the project.  When more funds are available the project will continue from one generation to the next passing on the understanding.</p>

<p>In August, Wi'am helped partner a camp for the children of Palestinian martyrs.  It was held at the YMCA in the near-by town of Beit-Sahour.  Over 60 children between the ages of 7-15 participated.  They came from all the cities and villages of Palestine, especially Nablus, Hebron, Jerusalem, and Bethlehem.  Throughout the week the children camped outside together.</p>   

<p>During the one week period, the children participated in various activities. These included lectures on such topics as: the Palestinian vision toward peace, the Palestinian rights about
water and land, and the Israeli settlements. They were also able to

learn about the history of the Palestinian scout movement.  Members
from Wi'am conducted trainings in conflict resolution.  The children learned to appreciate Palestinian heritage through songs and
dance.  They found opportunities to work together, and gain valuable leadership skills.</p>
                     
<p>This project of the camp was important for various reasons.  It was another step of reaching out to the community through the children.  Children need to be nurtured and given an opportunity.  As one staff member states, "We as 'Wi'am Center' felt that nobody is taking care of the children of martyrs.  They are feeling strangers in their society.  They are not living their own lives as children.  Nobody is supporting them financially, nor are satisfying
their essential needs."  It was a need that was seen, to take care of the children.</p>
           
<p>It was a special time of developing relationships and building bonds between broken hearts.  The children enjoyed the experience very much.  Because of the enthusiasm of the children, there are plans to continue such a camp for future years to come.</p>
