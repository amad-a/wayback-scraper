This is my story: Recounting of 1995</p>

<p>It happened shortly before the Israeli pullout from Bethlehem in December of 1995.  I was only 20 yrs old at the time, like many others.</p>

<p>I was on my way home to Bethlehem from Jerusalem.  I was stopped by the Israeli soldiers at the checkpoint, which leads in and out of Bethlehem.  After checking my papers, I was ushered aside, placed in handcuffs and into a van.  As it turns out my name was placed on some list, which contained a secret file on me.</p>

<p>After first going to the jail in Jerusalem, I was transported to a more severe prison.  The harsh treatment started immediately.  In interrogations, I was violently rattled back and forth which left my head bobbing in all directions.  Many times I would pass out from the terrible pain inflicted to my back and spine.  There was not just one person, but 5 different people all asking questions at the same time.  Each time I was taken aside for interrogation it lasted for around 10 hours.  The questions would lead in circles, as if they were playing games with my mind.  At times they made threats that they would bring in my sister and mother, and deal with them too if I did not give them information.  I had nothing to give.  Even when I thought that there would be a break because of someone going home, another would just take his place. The treatment continued for all 7 days of the week, non-stop.</p>

<p>When I was not being interrogated, I was left sleepless in contorted and excruciating positions.  The chair I was made to sit in had the two front legs shorter than the back legs.  My arms were tied together behind the chair.  Over my head, while I sat in the chair, was placed a stinking bag.  Breathing became very difficult.  In my cell at night, they put a spy who was trying to see if I knew anything and also to convince me to tell them what they wanted- which I knew nothing about.</p>

<p>This treatment endured for the next 17 days straight.  It wasn't until the 13th day that was I visited by a Red Cross worker.  On the 20th day I was finally able to see a lawyer.  Throughout this time my parents had no clue to my whereabouts.  They were very worried and concerned.  My Mom and Dad called every hospital and police station but came up empty.  Following interrogation I was held in what is known as 'Administrative Detention', which meant that they could legally hold me without a trial. My parents were only allowed to visit me once a month.</p>

<p>Three months later, on April 1, I was released.  For a long time afterwards I was moody and withdrawn.  My back to this day still causes me much pain.  I even have an eye condition, which is attributed to the dirty living conditions while in prison.  During the time period I was detained I had lost over 21kg.</p>

<p>The experience is a part of who I am as I try to live toward peace for all.</p>
