<h3>"Christmas 2000 in Bethlehem" -<i>1999</i></h3>

<p></p><center><a href="/planet.edu/~alaslah/images/abubig.jpg"><img src="/planet.edu/~alaslah/images/abugabel.jpg" alt="The Mountain" align="BOTTOM" width="290" height="200" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0"></a></center><p></p>

<p>This is a depiction of the modern Christmas story in Bethlehem. In the background is pictured the new settlement which is currently being constructed.
At the foot of the mountain, inside Bethlehem, is Mary and Baby Jesus inside a tent. -The Arabic writing on the bottom left can best be translated as -"Christ, we know you to be calm, so please be angry in the
Christmas evening." Which means- please be with us and support us, for we are in need of your help.</p>

<h3>"Miraculous Birth" -<i>1998</i></h3>

<p></p><center><a href="/planet.edu/~alaslah/images/mirbig.jpg"><img src="/planet.edu/~alaslah/images/miracle.jpg" alt="Art-Miracle Birth" align="BOTTOM" width="200" height="286" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0"></a></center><p></p>

<p>This piece of artwork is a sign of Hope, a hope for the Palestinians.On top it reads, "Despite the acute darkness, the dawn is coming, is coming, is coming." Through the darkness, the light shines down on
Palestine (which is filled with the picture of Mary holding Baby Jesus). The hands have broken out from the chains, and hold the state of the land high above the rubble from the demolished homes. Also growing out of the rubble is an olive branch, signaling a new peace, hopefully.

</p><h3>"VETO Demolitions" -<i>1997</i></h3>

<p></p><center><img src="/planet.edu/~alaslah/images/demol.jpg" alt="VETO Demolitions" align="BOTTOM" width="290" height="200" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0"></center><p></p>

<p>This is a commentary on the US support to Israel.  The US veto is pictured behind the Israeli bulldozer, pushing the destroying process forward.  The 'VETO' is displayed as large buildings, as settlements that the US has supported through its Veto and funds.  Each time a house is demolished it causes the 'peace process' to be torn apart, as if it is bleeding.</p>

<h3>"Holding Palestine" -<i>1990</i></h3>

<p></p><center><img src="/planet.edu/~alaslah/images/palestine.jpg" alt="Holding Palestine" align="BOTTOM" width="250" height="320" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0"></center><p></p>

<p>The beads, numbering around 33, are in the shape of Palestine, which is being held up and supported by a hand.  The hand is coming out of the darkness, out of the occupation and oppression. The tassel from the beads represent the colors of the Palestinian flag. Within the outline of Palestine is the cave where Jesus was born.  On top of the cave is a tower with a cross, and a Muslim minaret.  It signifies the unity of the Palestinians during the Intifada struggle.</p>

<h3>"Intifada Feelings" -<i>1989</i></h3>

<p></p><center><img src="/planet.edu/~alaslah/images/kofia.jpg" alt="Intifada Feelings" align="BOTTOM" width="290" height="200" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0"></center><p></p>

<p>A Palestinian Kofia wraps tightly around the cave where Jesus was born.  From the Palestinian Flag, the Bethlehem Star shines above the cave.  The Arabic messages can best be translated as saying, "I am walking dignified with lifting my head high." &amp; "In my palm is an olive branch, and on my shoulder is my coffin. I am walking- I am still walking- I am walking."  It means the willingness to offer peace, but also the courage to die for the sake of Palestine.</p>

<h3>"Living the Intifada" -<i>1988</i></h3>

<p></p><center><img src="/planet.edu/~alaslah/images/vivat.jpg" alt="Living the Intifada" align="BOTTOM" width="300" height="230" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0"></center><p></p>

<p>Here, in the confrontations of the Intifada, the Palestinians are standing tall.  A proud youth holds a Palestinian Flag which has both a cross and a crescent on top of the staff- representing the unity. The youth are are sending a message to the Israelis in an attempt to protect their land.  The poem in the top left corner can be translated as:  "I call upon you to kiss the land under your feet. I hold firmly your hands and saying I redeem you. I carried my blood on my shoulders.  I did not let my Flag fall.  I plant green grass on my parents' tombs."</p>

<h3>"Intifada Roots for Peace" -<i>?</i></h3>

<p></p><center><img src="/planet.edu/~alaslah/images/intolive.jpg" alt="The Mountain" align="BOTTOM" width="235" height="290" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0"></center><p></p>
<p>
Inside the trunk of the olive tree, which is rooted on top of Palestine, is Mary with the Baby Jesus.  The Palestinian flag is flying from the top of the tree, where on the pole is the cross inside the crescent- symbolizing Palestinian unity. Pictured is both a hand holding a stone, and a hand holding Palestine.  The two represent the cause to rid the occupation as well as the continued hope for peace.</p>
