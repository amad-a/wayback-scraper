<li><u><b>WOMENS' ACTIVITIES</b></u>

<p>Along with smaller events, two notable workshops were held: 1. "Strategic Planning for Development and Work"- 25 women were present, representing different women organizations various backgrounds from the city, village, and the refugee camp. 2. "Personal Status Workshop" - where the following issues were discussed: the spouses' positions and roles, comparing and contrasting personal status laws in Palestine, Jordan, &amp; Egypt.</p>  

</li><li><b><u>VISITS</u></b>

<p>The month was full of visitors to the area and to the Center.  Wi'am helped host an International Dialogue group from the United States.  Also, the exchange for the Youth Action Plan group began with the Swedish representatives visiting Palestine.  Next month the group of Palestinian representatives will visit Sweden.</p>

</li><li><u><b>STANDING IN SOLIDARITY</b></u>

<p>The Center's international volunteer joined a delegation of doctors to Iraq.  He was exposed to the situation there, and witness to the affect of the UN sanctions on the innocent children and families of Iraq.  As the doctors taught at one of the medical schools and made connection, our volunteer went with three other non-doctors to the city of Basra, located in the Southern No-Fly-Zone.  There they visited hospitals that lacked needed medicines, schools devoid of supplies, a sewage treatment plant deemed inoperable, and a displaced persons home unhealthy for community living.  He commented, "How inconceivable it is to sanction off the basics of life from any people, for any reason.  It is a crime against humanity!"</p>

</li><li><u><b>DARKNESS &amp; HOPE</b></u> 

<p>Over the past month Bethlehem has suffered greatly.  Youth and concerned individuals have continued to protest the new checkpoint, which is currently being built to separate Palestinians from tourists and Israelis.  After an Israeli soldier unjustly killed a young man, there have been daily clashes resulting in numerous injuries.</p>

<p>Wi'am would like to continue extending bright smiles to the children of Bethlehem this Christmas, even though the conditions and situation seem dim.  For the last few years the Center has worked diligently to provide gifts to children, who otherwise would be without.  To make this project of giving a success we depend on generous contributions from the outside.  Last year we handed out gifts to over 1,200 children during the 3 Christmas periods here in the Middle East.  We look forward to reaching more children this year with your help, to bring smiles and hope to children and families for the coming of the New Millennium.</p>

<br><font size="-1">Wi'am (<i>'Cordial Relationships'</i> -
in Arabic) began its formal service to the local community between
1994 and 1995.&nbsp; The main focus is resolving conflicts by using the
traditional Arab method - <i>Sulha-</i> integrated with Western techniques.&nbsp;
Along with <i>Sulha</i>, Wi'am works to prevent conflicts through education
of such topics of: Human Rights, Democracy, Media, Gender Issues.
<p>The times in Bethlehem remain to be unstable as the occupation continues.&nbsp;
Many of the internal conflicts stem from the checkpoint and the inability
to move freely back and forth to Jerusalem.&nbsp; For this reason, Wi'am
also supports individual's and family needs.&nbsp; Throughout the year
we try to raise money to help with building projects, sending children
to school, helping with needed operations, finding jobs for people, offering
trips for the youth, and providing gifts for children during the Christmas
time. (We welcome any support that others are able to offer in these matters.)
</p><p>As a grass-roots organization, Wi'am strives alongside other democratic
forces present in the larger Bethlehem community to build a democratic
and just society.&nbsp; The Center aims to improve the quality of relationships
by: addressing injustices rather than avenging them; dignifying persons
on both sides of the conflict; promoting human rights and advocating for
peace among all people.
