<li><u><b>Shoe Distribution:</b></u>

<p>Near the end of April, Wi'am worked in partnership with World Vision to distribute over a thousand pairs of tennis shoes to children in the Bethlehem, Beit Sahour, Beit Jala, Ramallah, and Jerusalem areas. This included some outlining villages and also some families from the refugee camps. Many of the families were given between 2-4 pairs of shoes for their children.  The goal was to reach as many needy families as possible, but along the way the giving showered down on others who may not be considered so needy.</p>

</li><li><u><b>Youth Conflict Resolution Course:</b></u>

<p>In the upcoming months, Wi'am will be hosting a conflict resolution course for the youth in Palestine.  Some experts in the traditional Sulha will be sharing their experiences and insights into using this technique. It will be a way for the college age youth to learn about the Arab traditions and customs of the culture when it comes to resolving conflicts.  The Center's director will also share insights into techniques used in the Western societies.</p>

</li><li><u><b>Sweden Activities:</b></u>

<p>At the beginning of 1999, Wi'am took part in a study abroad program.  We sent one of our college youth to Sweden to participate in an international peace study program. He recently returned at the beginning of July with warm insights from his experience.  This exchange is a part of the cooperation that began some years back with groups in Sweden.  Last Summer Wi'am sponsored a Palestinian youth to talk about local issues to students in various schools.  She represented Palestine along with a youth representing Israel.  Shortly after she returned, 2 youth from Wi'am participated in a youth conference held in Sweden.</p>

</li><li><u><b>Oklahoma Support:</b></u>

<p>In the middle of August, A member of Wi'am is joining a group of Palestinians going to Oklahoma in the United States.  Last Fall, a large tornado took outs its wrath on parts of Oklahoma causing much damage.  For 10 days, the Palestinians will be working with locals to continue the cleanup and rebuilding.  It is a way of extending the relationship to reach out to others who are also in need of help.</p>

</li><li><u><b>Volunteer Departed:</b></u>

<p>We are sad to say that one of our international volunteers has completed her service and has returned to the States to complete her Seminary degree.  She touched all of our lives deeply as her presence was an encouragement of support.  While working on projects she gave each of us something new to think about.  We wish her the best on her new adventure readjusting to the life in the States.  After completion of her degree she may decide to come back to Palestine; what a blessing that will be!</p>

</li><li><b><u>Social Case:</u></b>

<p>Recently a local family of 6 with the youngest being 3-years-old, suffered a terrible fire that destroyed their entire apartment.  The tragic event took the life of the 3-year-old who was not able to be rescued.  The staff here at the Wi'am Center, are doing all we can to support this family in their time of need with providing food, clothing, resources, and other necessary support.  We ask that you keep this family in your thoughts and prayers.</p>

</li><li><b><u>Recent Activities:</u></b>

<p>We have been conducting between 2-3 mediations everyday, which preoccupies a great deal of our activities.  Trainings have been held in Hebron, Bethlehem, Wadi Fakim, along with attending conferences and exchanges in: Germany, Cyprus, France, and Sweden.  As part of our ministry creating relationships, we hosted a group from Australia, having them connect with families and Palestinians.</p>

<hr width="100%">
<br><font size="2">Wi'am (<i>'Cordial Relationships'</i> -
in Arabic) began its formal service to the local community between
1994 and 1995.&nbsp; The main focus is resolving conflicts by using the
traditional Arab method - <i>Sulha-</i> integrated with Western techniques.&nbsp;
Along with <i>Sulha</i>, Wi'am works to prevent conflicts through education
of such topics of: Human Rights, Democracy, Media, Gender Issues.
<p>The times in Bethlehem remain to be unstable as the occupation continues.&nbsp;
Many of the internal conflicts stem from the checkpoint and the inability
to move freely back and forth to Jerusalem.&nbsp; For this reason, Wi'am
also supports individual's and family needs.&nbsp; Throughout the year
we try to raise money to help with building projects, sending children
to school, helping with needed operations, finding jobs for people, offering
trips for the youth, and providing gifts for children during the Christmas
time. (We welcome any support that others are able to offer in these matters.)
</p><p>As a grass-roots organization, Wi'am strives alongside other democratic
forces present in the larger Bethlehem community to build a democratic
and just society.&nbsp; The Center aims to improve the quality of relationships
by: addressing injustices rather than avenging them; dignifying persons
on both sides of the conflict; promoting human rights and advocating for
peace among all people.
