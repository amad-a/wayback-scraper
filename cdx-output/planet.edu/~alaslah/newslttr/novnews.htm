<p><b>CHRISTMAS SMILES:</b></p>

<p>Another GREAT SEASON is upon us as we prepare to begin a new Millennium. Celebrations will take off in the month of December, rejoicing the birth of Jesus Christ for a whole year to come. We mark this time to remember one special child, born nearly 2000 years ago, but how often these celebrations will overlook the young children of Bethlehem today.  In spreading the tender hand of love which Christ showed us, Wi'am staff and volunteers have seen the need to bring Smiles to the faces of children and their families alike.</p>

<p>This year Wi'am would like to continue extending bright smiles to the children of Bethlehem this Christmas, even though the conditions and situation seem dim.  For the last few years the Center has worked diligently to provide gifts to children, who otherwise would be without.  To make this project of giving a success we depend on generous contributions from the outside.  Last year we were able to hand out gifts to over 1,200 children during the 3 Christmas periods here in the Middle East.  We look forward to reaching more children this year with your help, bringing smiles and hope to children and families for the coming of the New Millennium.</p>

<p><b>WOMEN'S ACTIVITIES:</b></p>

<p>An open forum was held to discuss the recent factory accident in Hebron, where 20 women were killed.  After a speaker spoke about the accident, what led to it, and what could be done in the future to prevent such a disaster- women in the audience had a chance to share their concerns and ask further questions.</p>
<p>Also in the month- the network of women's organizations helped organize and host a 2-day exhibition, displaying and selling the handmade creations from women the organizations serve.</p>

<p><b>CHILDREN'S RIGHTS:</b></p>

<p>Wi'am helped to organize a four day conference with Defense for Children of Israel in Nazareth concerning the rights of children.  People attended from the United Nations, South Africa, India, Israel, Palestine and other nations where children lack sufficient rights.  Because of the uncertain future of the Palestinian people, it is sometimes controversial to bring Palestinians and Israelis together where it might look like they are on equal ground.  Even with knowing this- the Center still thought it best to keep a window open so the world could hear that Palestinian children still lack their basic rights.  It was a way of expressing the need for the children along with the needs of their parents.</p>     

<p><b>HELSINKI:</b></p>

<p>The Center's Director was invited to take part in a workshop to evaluate Israeli-Palestinian Civil Society Cooperative Activities.  Citizens' Security Council KATU (a Finnish NGO-based conflict prevention network) jointly with the Economic Cooperation Foundation (Israel) and the Palestinian Center for Peace (Palestine) facilitated the workshop.  Mr. Zoughbi shared his personal views concerning joint projects with Israeli organizations.</p>

<br><font size="2">Wi'am (<i>'Cordial Relationships'</i> -
in Arabic) began its formal service to the local community between
1994 and 1995.&nbsp; The main focus is resolving conflicts by using the
traditional Arab method - <i>Sulha-</i> integrated with Western techniques.&nbsp;
Along with <i>Sulha</i>, Wi'am works to prevent conflicts through education
of such topics of: Human Rights, Democracy, Media, Gender Issues.
<p>The times in Bethlehem remain to be unstable as the occupation continues.&nbsp;
Many of the internal conflicts stem from the checkpoint and the inability
to move freely back and forth to Jerusalem.&nbsp; For this reason, Wi'am
also supports individual's and family needs.&nbsp; Throughout the year
we try to raise money to help with building projects, sending children
to school, helping with needed operations, finding jobs for people, offering
trips for the youth, and providing gifts for children during the Christmas
time. (We welcome any support that others are able to offer in these matters.)
</p><p>As a grass-roots organization, Wi'am strives alongside other democratic
forces present in the larger Bethlehem community to build a democratic
and just society.&nbsp; The Center aims to improve the quality of relationships
by: addressing injustices rather than avenging them; dignifying persons
on both sides of the conflict; promoting human rights and advocating for
peace among all people.
