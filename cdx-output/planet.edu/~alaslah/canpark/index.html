<p></p><blockquote>The project focuses on Canada Park, a nature park constructed on the former site of three Palestinian villages <b>(Yalu, <a href="/planet.edu/~alaslah/canpark/villages/imwas/imwas.html"><font size="4">'Imwas</font></a>, Beit Nuba)</b> in the Latrun area of the West Bank.  The Israeli army destroyed these villages shortly after the 1967 war.  The park was constructed in the mid-seventies by the Jewish National Fund, with the assistance of the Jewish community in Canada. The former inhabitants of the villages, whose population including their descendants  reaches 30,000 people to date, are now refugees and are prevented from visiting their former homes. They are also prevented from visiting and preserving three Moslem cemetaries and tombs which remain intact but in a very poor condition after the destruction.<p></p>

<p>The project aims to raise awareness of the tragedy of the three villages and the villagers, to educate both Palestinian and Israeli communities about the history of the site and in doing so to change the experience of the visitor to "Canada Park".  Initially two Israeli and two Palestinian international fellows of Brandeis University joined together on this project. Other participants in the project include former residents of the three Palestinian villages, residents of local Israeli communities, Israeli and Palestinian peace activists and journalists from both communities.</p></blockquote>
