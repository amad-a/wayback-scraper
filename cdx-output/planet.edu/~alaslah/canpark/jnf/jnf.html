<p></p><center>The following was taken from a JNF website:<br>  
<u>(www.total.net/~mtl1/history.html)</u></center><p></p>
<p>The Jewish National Fund . a deep-rooted tradition in Jewish life.</p>

<p>The Jewish National Fund is the oldest institution in existence dedicated to the upbuilding of the Jewish Homeland, its origin going back to the year 1901.  Since its inception, the JNF has performed miracles!
</p><p>
Nearly 800 rural settlements - about 80% of all rural settlements in the country - have been established on JNF land.  By planting 180 million trees, building nearly 6,000 kilometers of access roads, by covering nearly 270,000 acres with trees, by reclaiming nearly 195,000 acres of hitherto useless land, JNF has literally changed the face of the country.
</p><p>
The Jewish National Fund, entrusted with all land reclamation activity in Israel, has been a major force in the building of the Nation.  The tradition of marking milestones in Jewish family life through gifts of the Jewish National Fund furthers this noble work, indispensable to Israel's growth and well-being.</p> 
<hr size="2">
<p>
In reading the above, one must remember that the land that was created to be Israel was <b>NOT</b> 'A land without People'.  Thousands upon thousands of Palestinians were displaced and had their villages destroyed - and covered up with the help of the JNF.
