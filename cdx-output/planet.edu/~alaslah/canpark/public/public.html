Since the destruction of the three villages, there have been various accounts recorded through different media mediums.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="/planet.edu/~alaslah/canpark/public/wereno.html">The Villages that Never Were</a><br>This article written in 1984 gives a good overview of the destruction of the 3 villages and why they are rarely mentioned in Israeli guide books.  It is full of interviews of key indivduals from the villages, those who took part in their destruction, and others from guide books.</p>

</li><li><p><a href="/planet.edu/~alaslah/canpark/public/amos.html">Witness Account</a><br>This is an article which was written by Amos Kenan in 1967 as a reflection to the destruction of the villages.  He is a well known Israeli columnist, who at the time was part of the platoon assigned the job of clearing the villages.</p>

</li><li><p><a href="/planet.edu/~alaslah/canpark/public/transcribe.html">Park with No Peace- Transcription</a><br>This is the full transcription of an investigative video produced by the Canadian Broadcast Company about Canada Park.  It brings to light what happened during the destruction, why it happened, who was behind it, and it also holds accountable the <a href="/planet.edu/~alaslah/canpark/jnf/jnf.html">JNF (Jewish National Fund)</a> who helped fund the building of the park, which covers-up the destruction.</p>

</li><li><p><a href="/planet.edu/~alaslah/canpark/public/jertimes.html">A Tale of Three Villages</a><br>The following is a partial reproduction of an article ran by the Jerusalem Times on June 14th, 1996. Included within the article are personal interviews from individuals from each of the three villages.</p>

</li><li><p><a href="/planet.edu/~alaslah/canpark/public/unfin.html">Unfinished History</a><br>This is an article written by an Israeli who participated in the clean up of the cemetery.  This is his reflection on that day, and the history it carries.</p>

</li><li><p><a href="/planet.edu/~alaslah/canpark/public/nowhere.html">Like a Flight to Nowhere</a><br>This is an article from a person who went with the group on a visit to where the three villages once stood, back in 1998.  It includes reflections of the event, as well as short conversations.</p>

</li><li><p><a href="/planet.edu/~alaslah/canpark/public/civlesson.html">A Civics Lesson in Latrun</a><br>The article, which was printed in a Hebrew newspaper, is a commentary to the Jubilee celebrations of Israel.  It remarks on a park adjacent to 'Canada Park', and questions why the history of 1967 is not told.</p>
