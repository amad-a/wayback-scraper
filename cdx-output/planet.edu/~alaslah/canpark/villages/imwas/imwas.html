'Imwas has a long and well documented history it is thought to preserve the Biblical name Emmaus, first mentioned as the Syrian camp taken by Judas Maccabaeus in 161 BC. In 167 BC, when the Jews rebelled against the Roman occupation of Palestine, they are thought to have fought one of their most heroic battles at 'Imwas. Years later Emmaus became a typical flourishing Roman-Byzantine city, with a Jewish community.  In 43 BC, Cassius sold the inhabitants into slavery for failing to pay their taxes. According to the New Testament, Jesus Christ visited it breifly after his resurrection.  In 70 AD, the Roman Fifth Legion camped for two years at the site, before their final assault on Jerusalem.</p>

<p>
Although 'Imwas had fewer homes than the other two neighboring villages, it held great prestige. 'Imwas was one of the first villages to have a water pipeline, that helped feed the wells.  The village accommodated 2 schools, a post office, a police station, a clinic, many shops, as well as having 3 cemeteries stationed on the land.  All the people of the village were as one family</p>
