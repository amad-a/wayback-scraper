<p>The Palestinian Conflict Resolution Center began operation in March of 1995.  Known as "Wi'am", which in Arabic means ("cordial relationships") the Center helps to resolve disputes within the Palestinian community by complementing the traditional Arab form of mediation, called <i>Sulha</i>, with Western models of conflict resolution.  When Wi'am opened its doors, a vacuum of authority existed in West Bank society.  The authority of the Israeli military occupation had never been accepted, and there was no clear Palestinian authority outside Gaza and Jericho.  Since many of the traditional village leaders <i>(mukhtars)</i> were appointed by the Israelis during the occupation, their legitimacy was no longer fully accepted by the community.</p>

<p>Although Palestinian autonomy is now extending into most major population centers in the West Bank, in reality 70% of the West Bank remains under Israeli military occupation.  The Palestinian community has been severely weakened by thirty-two years of Israeli military occupation (since 1967), and the transition of power to the Palestinian National Authority is being implemented piecemeal, at best.  One of the consequences of this situation is that there is no clear means of resolving disputes within the Palestinian community.  It is in this context that the Wi'am Center continues its operation.</p>
