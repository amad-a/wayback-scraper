</b>
<p align="LEFT">It is all too common to hear the Israelis and their close
allies, the “mediators”, the USA, say that it is important for the violence
to stop before returning to the negotiating table. This is, no doubt, supported
by both parties in this conflict. However, what is viewed as violence is
different for the Palestinians and Israelis. The violence referred to by the
Israelis, and their ally, is insurgent violence, which is the result of the
systemic violence that has plagued the Palestinian people for many years at the
hand of their occupier. Shlomo Ben-Ami, former Israeli Foreign Minister in the
Barak Government, said, “Accusations made by a well-established society about
how a people it is oppressing is breaking the rules to attain its rights do not
have much credence” (<i>Ha'aretz</i>, 28 November 2000, Article by Akira
Elder). Unfortunately, the violence of occupation, the violence committed by the
colonial power, has been legitimized. We must, after all, remember that might
does not make it right.</p>
<p align="LEFT">There are currently <b>four types</b> of violence influencing
the lives of the peoples of this land. The most talked about is <b>insurgent
violence</b>, carried out by nationalists and others who have opted to revolt
against the occupation, siege, and oppression inflicted upon them (for more than
33 years). Let us remember the words of former Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, who
said, “If I were a Palestinian, I'd also join a 'terror' group” (<i>Ha'aretz</i>,
3 June 1998), epitomizing the idea that one person's terrorist is another's
freedom fighter. It is a common fallacy for people to ignore uniformed violence,
and simply blame the victims rather than the perpetrators of these evils.</p>
<p align="LEFT">But the other three forms of violence are being carried out
against the Palestinians by the Israelis and their supporters. Structural
violence, environmental violence, and state sponsored violence are all part of
the system being used to continue to subject the Palestinians to the de facto
apartheid that is currently in place.</p>
<b>
</b><p align="LEFT"><b>Structural violence</b> is that which is carried out directly by
the occupier and its agents against the occupied people. This violence may
either be threatened or actualized. It consists of house demolitions,
destruction of businesses, and infrastructure, whether through the use of
bulldozers or shelling, and the closure policy, which is an active part of the
current siege, and part of everyday occupation. The threat of these things
happening is almost as great as this being actualized. The terror created
through demolition orders for homes or businesses that have been built or
expanded with or without “proper” documentation from the occupying power is
paralyzing. Israel is using the system of laws to subjugate the Palestinian
people further… laws that have been set in place by four systems: Ottoman
rule, Emergency British laws from the Mandate Period, Jordanian laws, and
finally Israeli Military law. The Palestinians are unable to challenge any of
the laws passed against them unless they have been forced or have chosen to
become citizens of the state of Israel (this is only possible for Palestinians
living within the land taken to form the state of Israel in 1948).</p>
<b>
</b><p align="LEFT"><b>Environmental violence</b>, consisting of the destruction or
confiscation of agricultural land, crops, trees, etc., is seldom reported, but
always present.</p>
<b>
</b><p align="LEFT"><b>State sponsored violence</b> consists of allowing heavily armed
settlers, placed in the occupied territories illegally by the occupying power,
to roam, unchecked and undeterred, as they terrorize the indigenous people of
the land. In its attempts to carry on its divide and conquer policy, Israel has
recruited collaborators and “death squads” to carry out clandestine actions
that it would not like to be publicly responsible for. Such policies aim to
enhance chaos and further hopelessness among the Palestinian people.</p>
<p align="LEFT">We must not fall into the trap of legitimizing the violence
perpetrated by <b>those in uniform</b>, especially when that violence is
committed on civilians and uniformed persons who did not provoke an attack, but
simply want to live as human beings in land where they have lived for countless
generations.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Violence always has an adverse effect. Those who are most
affected by the violence are those who have to spend every moment trying to cope
with its effects. The Palestinians live with the violence created by the
occupation on a daily basis, and therefore, deserve much less blame for the
current situation. They did not ask to be occupied, to have their land
systematically stolen from them to build settlements… in the West Bank, in the
Gaza Strip, and East and West Jerusalem.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The violence experienced by the Palestinians has led to many
problems, including the psychological impact on the people created by the siege.
Trauma is experienced by all of the people here. This trauma is not limited by
age, sex, status, or religion. Women, children, men, shopkeepers, religious
leaders, tour guides, police officers, and teachers are all traumatized by the
violence being perpetrated against them. Tanks fire on a regular basis into
civilian areas, helicopters attack homes, businesses, and people. After a while,
the people are so frightened by the sight of such high-tech weaponry that the
sight or sound of these weapons causes trauma. Mental health, as well as
physical health, are seriously disturbed by the impact of violence. It is rare
to come across someone who has not suffered health problems during the time of
the siege. <b>While physical structures may be rebuilt, it is much more
difficult to rebuild the psyche of an entire people who have been traumatized by
the policies and practices of their oppressors. The implications of this trauma
will have to be dealt with for years to come, even after the occupying colonial
power withdraws its weapons of destruction and fear!</b></p><b>
</b>
<p align="LEFT">Stress related sicknesses are on the rise. They are becoming
more and more prevalent within society. The lack of medical supervision, as many
“patients” are unable to travel to hospital only adds to this problem. The
number of cases of stress related illness has grown exponentially over the last
months, and with the current siege, there is little hope that this will change
in the near future.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The physical impact of the violence is the most apparent for the
observer. It takes little time to see the devastation that has occurred at the
hands of the occupying colonial power. Homes with new “windows”, blown out
by missiles fired from tanks and helicopters, are common place. In some
villages, an observer would have to look long and hard to find a single pane of
glass still intact. The livelihood of the people is being taken from them. Olive
trees, orchards, agricultural land, and greenhouses have all been
destroyed/confiscated. Roads connecting villages have been destroyed by trenches
or blocked with piles of earth or large concrete blocks. Buildings, farms, and
factories have been destroyed through shelling and shooting.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The economic impact of violence is crippling for the Palestinian
people. This is well documented by journalists, economists, and diplomats, both
international, as well as Palestinian and Israeli. Tourism, farming,
construction, and industries have all been devastated by the destruction of
roads, closure policy, travel restrictions on tourists, and restrictions placed
on the indigenous people. Unemployment has reached dangerous levels because of
the siege and lack of possibilities for work<b>. The frustration created by
unemployment has caused the people to feel inadequate, and eventually leads to
greater psychological impact due to the violence.</b> As a result of the siege,
fear and violence of the occupier, the entire population of the West Bank (as
always, including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip has been taken hostage
under the new Israeli apartheid policy.</p>
<p align="LEFT">There is a great political impact due to the current violence
and siege. The arms of dialogue have been replaced by the dialogue of arms. The
Palestinian Authority is unable to do what is considered necessary of them.
Programs and Ministries have not been able to locate the proper funding to
support their work. The United Nations special envoy to the region has warned
that the Palestinian Authority is teetering on collapse because it does not have
the monetary funds to pay its workers and staff. He said that it is only a
matter of time before there is nothing left for the colonial power to hold
“peace talks” with.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Because of the current siege, all the violence the indigenous
people are facing, the psychological, physical, economic, and political impact
of the violence, occupation, and oppression, there is an increased number of
Palestinian people seeking to emigrate. Palestinians are forced to look outside
for work to support their families. With their homes and businesses destroyed,
there is less to hold them to their native land, and as they are not people who
appreciate being subjected to such hardship, hatred, racism, bigotry, and de
facto apartheid, they are looking elsewhere for employment, security, freedom,
liberty, and justice. Visas are readily available for anyone with a one-way
ticket out of the country. The Israeli policy seems to be to let people leave
if, and only if, it looks likely that they will not return.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Israeli policy on dealing with the Palestinians is well
known and documented at this point, and is possibly best represented here, “We
declare openly that the Arabs have no right to settle on even one centimeter of
Eretz Israel… Force is all they do or ever will understand. We shall use the
ultimate force until the Palestinians come crawling to us on all fours… When
we have settled the land, all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to
scurry around like drugged roaches in a bottle” (Israeli Chief of Staff Rafael
Eitan, quoted in <i>The New York Times,</i> 14 April 1983). The persistent
suppression, occupation, subjugation, and siege perpetrated by this formidable
colonial power are disastrous to the indigenous people of Palestine/Israel. It
has been said, diplomacy is the art of delaying the inevitable. If this is the
case the Palestinians seem to want no more of it. “Why should we all continue
to lose our daughters and sons, parents and spouses, brothers and sisters?”
There will come a time when the two peoples that now inhabit this land, the
colonials and the indigenous, will live together, for the simple fact remains,
neither will leave on their own, and we pray that the world will not allow
either to be forced out.</p>
