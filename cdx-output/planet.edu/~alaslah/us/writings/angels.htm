<p>
</p><center><h5>Making Angels out of Demons</h5></center>

<p>Why is it, that when we struggle so hard, we bring ourselves down?  It would seem that we actually shoot ourselves in the foot.  Even so, we are still responsible for the direction and path we are on, even if we refuse to admit to that fact.
</p><p>
I agree that it is so easy to see the gray, the black, and the dirt in the world.  It stands out beckoning us to highlight its existence.  Don't doubt that the white does not exist, for it does, just so often it is so bright that we must look away to that which is easier for the eyes to see.</p><p>

Those of us who should be standing together as a tower, find ourselves as scattered meaningless stones.  The harsh weather conditions of rain and wind continue to slowly tear away at our outer layers.
</p><p>
Why is it that we feel it is our right to step on our neighbor in order to get ahead for ourselves?  Is it out of fear that someone may do it to us first?  Maybe the opportunity finally came?  Is it a loss of community, or is community just a lifeline for those waiting to jump up the ladder?  It is called the 'Ladder of Success', but success of what- if one finds himself on the top all alone?
</p><p>
Seldom does one hear of those who are left below praising the efforts of those who have found success.  Instead, the fingers point most readily to failures, the wrongs committed, and those things not yet achieved.  
</p><p>
It is easy to point a finger toward others, and so difficult to turn it inwards.  Looking to the faults of others is a self-defense mechanism preventing a person from feeling worse about his own plight.  The spotlight is removed from his own faults as long as he can redirect the attention.
</p><p>
Nations, over the years have become experts at diverting attention from their own problems.  The powerful use their might, creating hotspots around the world far away from their own borders.  A strategy it may be, but only for temporary survival- for the problem still remains to grow within the borders.  It becomes a bandage for the skin as the inside continues to bleed.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the media where we get our news and try to learn about the world- is a tool at highlighting the dark-side.  Watching the news becomes depressing, for nearly everything mentioned seems to be bad.  Why do the terrible things that happen arouse our interest and curiosity?  During elections the media attempts to dig up 'dirt' on the candidates.  Does it really make things more interesting, or the voters more depressed?  Any individual in the public spotlight is a potential for having his name and reputation smeared.  For what?
</p><p>
Through usually focusing on the negative, the media uses this power to put forth its own agenda of what horror stories to tell.  Who controls the media controls what the public is told.  They practically write the history; even if it is a one sided telling of the story.
</p><p>
As an example, the media is quick to point out the faults and misdoing of the Palestinian Authority, but are shy to address the injustices caused by the Israeli government.  It is as if they are redirecting the attention and trying to change the issues.  Has the media ever mentioned the accomplishments of the Palestinian Authority after being under complete 'occupation' for 26 years?  For nearly three decades there was very little infrastructure provided or services to the people within the territories.  Since the Palestinian Authority took over, building began, elections were held, and improvements slowly implemented.
</p><p>
As the governing authority is still yet young in Palestine- for as a child, it will make mistakes.  Even along the way it will fumble, fall backwards, and even fall down.  How will it get back up?  Is criticism the answer, or the pushing force down?
</p><p>
It is easy for us who come from the outside of a situation to jump on the media wagon, pointing fingers at all that may be wrong.  The funny thing is that those who are standing on the inside are not short sighted of the problems, but the may lack insight to possible solutions.  As outsiders we can come to understand the complexities of the problems, attempt to put forth possible solutions, and complement with encouragement and praise.
</p><p>
But it is this that I ask - - - 
</p><p>
How strong is our heart<br>
How wise is our mind<br>
How gentle is our spirit<br>
How true is our soul<br>
		</p><blockquote>To see the light in the dark<br>
		To see the good emerge from the bad<br>
		To see the life rise out of the dead<br>
		To see the hope sprout out of despair<br>
		To see a solution instead of a problem<br>
		And to share encouragement in place of lone criticism</blockquote><p></p>
