<p align="LEFT"><font size="2">In March 1996 the area became the site of the
first Israeli police station in East Jerusalem outside the Old City. One year
later the municipality began tearing up the sidewalks on Salah ad-Din and Zahra
Streets. The object was to replace the large, handcut colorful grained
flagstones with a pallid, machine- cut pavement. At issue for Palestinian
Jerusalemites was the authoritative displacement of their storical sense of the
city with that of the Israeli municipality's. The old stones had been laid by
the Jordanian municipality in 1954, but their shape and texture resembles older
urban architectural traditions going back to Salah ad-Din and earlier. The
community later learned that the municipality's renovation was part of a larger
project, titled the Salah ad-Din Project, to construct an urban infrastructure
that mirrors that of downtown West Jerusalem. It is this struggle over place and
space that the municipality's brochure re-represents as part and parcel of a
dominant modernist aesthetics of “clean streets.”</font></p><font size="2">
<p align="LEFT">&nbsp;The itinerant vendors around Bab al-Amud are part of a
very particular Palestinian experience of urban Jerusalem. Peasant women and
petty-commodity vendors from West Bank villages to the north and south of the
city have a long history of selling their goods in the Bab al-Amud area
particularly on Fridays, the main market day. These women have been the target
of a vicious campaign by the municipality for years. With the Olmert
administration, harassment of the vendors and confiscation of their produce
became stated municipal policy. On November 28, 1996, for instance, municipal
workers and border guards violently attempted to remove the women vendors,
leaving an elderly woman from a refugee camp hospitalized.</p>

population, a source of constant tension and the attempts of entering the Aqsa-Mosque

<p align="LEFT"><font size="2">Jewish Jerusalem is top-heavy with housing and
lacks an adequate economic base to provide jobs for all the residents who have
been encouraged to settle there for demographic purposes (thus the efforts of
the Jerusalem Development Authority since the 1980s to develop high-tech
industry in Jerusalem). This fact, combined with the growing municipal expense
of the increasing ultra-orthodox population, has caused the city to run a $120
million annual deficit, although it receives hefty subsidies from the national
government. As the numbers of the ultra-orthodox population grow, they gain
increasing influence over city politics and claim a disproportionate share of
public resources for their community (the results of the recent November 1998
municipal elections demonstrate their growing political influence).</font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font size="2">The Israeli public overwhelmingly opposes ever
dividing Jerusalem again or ceding Israeli control over any part of the city.
According to one recent poll, while 68 percent of the Israeli public (excluding
Israeli Arabs) favor further land concessions on the West Bank, 84 percent
oppose any Israeli withdrawal from East Jerusalem.[1] In light of this
consensus, politicians have calculated that by conjuring up the threat of
Jerusalem's re-division—construed as a return to pre-1967 barbed wire fences,
snipers, and no man's lands—they can galvanize public support for whichever
"strong leader" can portray himself as the city's true defender.</font></p>

government action, not officially sanctioned. Certain government agencies,
positions, authorities acting in concert with settler groups, using legal, quasi
- legal and illegal means to take over Palestinian properties, especially in
Silwan and the Muslim quarter. This involved the illegal allocation of tens of
millions of government dollars. Private contributions were a pittance, for
instance such as those from Ateret Cohanim and Elad. It involved systematic
abuse of the absentee property law, properties were declared absentees
properties on the basis of questionable and false documents. It involved
conflict of interests, where people from the settler groups sat on committees
handing out money to themselves. Illegal loans etc… There was illegal
allocation of funds and government properties to settler groups without tenders,
bids or criteria. There were strong hints of misappropriation of funds.</font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font size="2">Jerusalem has the highest percentage of tenants
in the West Bank with 27.4%, due in part to poverty and the restriction on
building. Within the Old City, where 40% of houses are severely substandard,
about half of all residents rent their homes from owners, or are given rent-free
housing as social welfare cases by the churches or the Awqaf.</font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Migration</b></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font size="2">A high number of Jerusalem residents by birth
migrate to other areas of the West Bank for housing and work (8.2%), a dramatic
demonstration of the social and economic pressures of life in East Jerusalem,
especially housing shortages.</font></p><font size="2">
<p align="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
</font><u>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Labor force</b></p>
</u>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2">The Palestinian labor force in Jerusalem is
marked by low skilled employment, low female participation and job insecurity
due to competition with foreign workers. About 28% of the 31,800 registered
non-Jewish employed persons in Jerusalem were unskilled workers in 1995,
compared to only 5.6% of Jewish unskilled workers. 35.5% were industrial,
construction, or agricultural workers compared to just 13% of Jewish workers.
Female labor force participation rate is 12-19% for Palestinian women, but 52%
for Israeli women in the city. The employment of women accounts for much higher
“family income” among Jews in Jerualem, where the average net income per
household was NIS 7,583 in 1996. The average family income is more than twice as
high among Jews as non-Jews and individual incomes are three times as high. In
terms of per capita GNI, the rate is seven times as high.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
</font><u>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Poverty</b></p>
</u>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2">Israeli statistics show the poverty rate in
Jerusalem as 27.4% of residents (21% of families) and attribute the high rate to
the large proportion of non-Jews and Jewish ultra-Orthodox in the city.
Israel’s latest statistical report on Jerusalem notes that the poverty index
is calculated by the National Insurance Institute and includes “almost no Arab
inhabitants,” so that the actual rate is much greater. If the Israeli poverty
line of 50% of the median disposable income (which includes government
assistance) is applied to Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, an estimated
45-60% of the population would fall into the category of “poor.”</font></p>
<font size="2">
<p align="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
</font><u>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tax</b></p>
</u>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2">The balance between taxation and social benefits
and its relationship to potential political resistance has been well understood
by Israeli policy-makers. They have chosen to apply taxes gradually but steadily
on East Jerusalem residents, at the same time extending social insurance, and
have been flexible in reconsidering tax policies which have proved too
controversial. After the first decade of rule in Palestinian Jerusalem, however,
Israel was applying taxes and expecting payments at the same rate as applied in
Jewish West Jerusalem despite measurable differences in per capita income
between the two population groups and the lack of recognition by Palestinians of
Israeli political authority.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2"><i>New taxes:</i> Immediately after its
occupation in 1967 of those parts of Jerusalem previously under Jordanian
administration, Israel applied a number of new taxes on its 70,000 Palestinian
residents: income tax, taxes to cover absorption loans, and a civil defense
levy.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
</font><u>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Politics / Institutions</b></p>
</u>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2">Only an estimated 3.3 percent of the eligible
Arab East Jerusalem voters turned out on November 1998 for municipality
election, making this the lowest participation rate since 1967.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2">As for Palestinian institutions in the city,
while Palestinians failed in 1967 to preserve an independent East Jerusalem
Municipal Government, they did keep Israel from taking over the East Jerusalem
Chamber of Commerce, the Jerusalem Electric Corporation, the Moqassed Hospital,
and the curriculum of Palestinian schools. They also preserved the independence
of a range of professional associations, and, under Jordanian sponsorship,
re-established the Supreme Muslim Council. These battles involved legal
struggle, public appeals at the United Nations and other international forums,
and civil disobedience, including strikes.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2">In a recent analytical piece in the Jerusalem
Times, Said Ghazali observed that "Palestinians currently lack a strategic
master plan. Construction of new houses in the Old City is limited, and the
millions of dollars collected abroad is not efficiently used." Further
analysis of the sort we have ventured here might explore what institutional
structures in Palestinian society have blocked the development of such a
unified, intersectoral strategy in the city. In particular, we might ask why
there has not been a more unified opposition to the policy of closure, which is
having such a broad and destructive impact on Palestinians. Such understanding
of the shortcomings of current strategies must inform future efforts to preserve
Arab Jerusalem. In developing such strategies, however, Palestinians should not
invest Israel with omnipotence. As we have seen, the best-laid schemes of
Israeli social engineering often go awry. Nor should we underestimate the role
that Palestinians themselves have played in shaping the city. They have left a
long record of active intervention, from whose failures and successes</font> <font size="2">they
can learn for the future.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><u><b>Economy</b></u></p><u>
</u>
<p align="LEFT"><font size="2">By comparison, Palestinians have less
successfully resisted Israel's ongoing strangulation of the Arab economy. Since
March 1993 Israel has closed Jerusalem to residents of the West Bank under the
pretext of security. The real aim has been to sever economic ties between Arab
Jerusalem and the West Bank and to divide the West Bank itself into isolated
Northern and Southern regions. To this end Israel has also banned the sale of
certain West Bank products in the city. The closure has meant an enormous loss
of business. It has also forced 80 percent of Palestinian NGOs to move to areas
outside the checkpoints to be accessible to staff and c festival. Because of the
continuing closure, however, the success of this year's two-week shopping
festival (from July 12th to the 24th) depended on Palestinians from within the
"green line," meaning it had little positive effect.</font></p>
