</p><h4>Discovering True Peace - Through Sincere Reconciliation</h4>  

<p>Talk to us about reconciliation<br> 
Only if you first experience<br> 
the anger of our dying.</p> 

<p>Talk to us about reconciliation<br>  
If your living is not the cause<br>  
of our dying.?</p>  

<p>Talk to us about reconciliation <br> 
Only if your words are not products of your devious scheme<br>  
to silence our struggle for freedom.</p> 

<p>Talk to us about reconciliation<br> 
Only if your intention is not to entrench yourself<br>  
more on your throne.</p> 

<p>Talk to us about reconciliation<br>  
Only if you cease to appropriate all the symbols<br>  
and meanings of our struggle.</p>

<p> Filipino poet - - J. Cabazares</p> 
 <hr align="CENTER" size="2" color="Black">                        
<p>Reconciliation as a topic of consideration has become a fad.  It is currently the 'hip
thing' to be involved with.  It seems that everyone wants to talk about and even support
reconciliation and its efforts toward peace.  But,-what are the parts of reconciliation
and how do they play out in realizing true Peace?</p>  

<p>Involving injustices needing to be reconciled, there are two main actors- the Oppressor
(Israel), and the Oppressed (Palestinians).  One has taken the proactive role of
creating facts on the ground, while the other is forced to take a reactive role of
survival.</p>  

<p>The Oppressor wants normalization and seeks to attain the status quo that it desires. 
It is the Oppressor who rushes to reconciliation in hopes that it will calm the wrong in
their heart.  For the Oppressor in offering reconciliation, there is no price to pay and
nothing to lose, for it is only a gesture to make one feel better.</p>  

<p>Although the Oppressor continues to 'cry for security', it is the Oppressor who has
security- carrying the guns and holding the keys against the Oppressed.  The
Oppressor marches their toy soldiers to the beat of the mentality that 'might makes
right'.  As they hold their armor high, they are only protected from the truth.  
In taking part in reconciliation, the Oppressor often uses the opportunity to its
advantage.  The Oppressor undercuts the willingness to talk by its physical statements
of seized land, torn away olive groves, demolished houses, the creation of more
settlements, and the building of more by-pass roads that separate Palestinian towns
and villages from each other.  As they talk out of one side of their mouth and nod their
head with a condescending smile, their hands speak louder of destruction. If they fail to
see us in the state of Israel, how can they see us as a separate entity in the Holy
Land?</p>  

<p>The Oppressed continues to long for Justice.  Embodiment of justice, is the means to
true peace- justice of acknowledgment, -justice of human rights to live with food, water,
and shelter, -justice of opportunity, -justice to hold onto one's heritage, -justice to learn
and express one's voice, -and the justice of freedom from captivity.</p>  

<p>As a parent, I often find myself humbled by the innocent words of my children. Not long
ago my seven-year old daughter reminded me of how important it is to have the
contrition stage in conflict resolution. She was upset because one of her cousins hit her
and made her cry. Realizing his mistake, her cousin came to apologize. My daughter
said, "Saying sorry is not enough, I need a present." If this is the logic of a child, how
can a nation accept anything less?</p> 

<p>Reconciliation toward these injustices can not be approached like a '10 minute oil
change'.  There are careful considerations to be taken in order to build a strong
foundation for the pyramid of peace.  Since the beginning of the occupation, the
Oppressed lived without security and safety for their families and communities. 
Without a moment notice fathers and sons were whisked away, and never heard from
again.  Families have been torn apart by borders and barb-wired fences.  Children
walked the streets unclothed, crying from hunger and thirst.</p> 

<p>Reconciliation can not be carried out until there is collaboration amongst those
dimensions that are struggling for peace.  On the one hand Palestinians continue to
struggle to get rid of the occupation.  Secondly, are the Israelis from the 'Peace Camp'
who desires to get rid of being the occupier.  They have very little influence on the
government, but constitute a ray of hope in Israel.  And thirdly, outside parties of
pro-justice and pro-peace who are eager to help.  We should not be too optimistic even
with having the collaboration, because there still remains the main obstacle for
reconciliation- the Israeli Government.  Through collaboration, the various groups
might have some leverage on Israel.</p> 

<p>This is but a small glimpse at the history of the Oppressed who has the power of
morality and has high integrity.  History of the Oppressed should not be forgotten or
dismissed, but must be analyzed because of its importance to the present and the
future.  It is so often said that; "history repeats itself".  By taking a look at the history
of the Oppressed, it is evident that what happened to the forefathers, continues today
to their children in different ways. We should learn from history by nullifying the
message that the only thing we learned from history is that we haven't learned from
history. Analyzing this history closely with a sincere desire for change can keep it from
being the future history of their grandchildren. By referring to the history, the goal is to
redress the injustices, not revenge them, and definitely not to turn it into a
'chicken-egg' issue. The cycle of violence must be broken and replaced with
cooperation for reconciliation.  Otherwise, 'displaced aggression' will instigate a new
cycle of violence. History is full such examples. The Jews with many others were the
direct victims of the Holocaust. The irony of the situation in Israel/Palestine is that we
Palestinians became the victims of the victims of the Holocaust.</p> 

<p>Between the Oppressed and the Oppressor there is a huge power inequity holding the
Oppressed always as the 'underdog' figure.  The reasons for the oppressor mentality
need to be addressed to bring a balance of equality. Reconciling a wrong involves both
a change of heart with sincere remorsefulness and a change in action.  Listed below are
just a few changes that need to be made to pave the way for reconciliatory dialogue
between the Oppressed and the Oppressor.  
</p><ul>
<li>Political prisoners released and granted the same freedom as everyone  
</li><li>Checkpoints must be removed and freedom of movement preserved  
</li><li>Confiscation of land halted and construction of settlements should be stopped  
</li><li>Natural resources of water and land available for all to use  
</li><li>Access to the media with a free voice  
</li><li>Legislation created to change discriminatory laws  
</li><li>The geographical unity of the West Bank should be preserved and free and safe
passage between Gaza and the West Bank guaranteed</li></ul><p></p>  

<p>We understand that when we talk about reconciliation we should tackle the
easier issues first and then the more complicated ones.  Urgency says the thorny issues
(land, water, settlements, refugees, and boundaries), and mainly the dispute over
Jerusalem, should be addressed before it is too late.</p>  

<p>There are two critical items that must be addressed for the Palestinians before moving
further with reconciliation.  First, since 1948, Palestinians have lost at least $100 billion
dollars worth of land, agriculture, housing, and belongings.  There needs to be
reparation paid to those who have incurred losses and have been displaced, so that
they have the "right of return".  Second, there needs to be a change in the way history
is written.  History should be highlighting the truth of events and true character of
people, nullifying the myths and stereotypes.  All students should be given the
opportunity to know that Palestinians are people, that they are not "terrorists",
"fundamentalists", or "dirty animals".</p>  

<p>Reconciliation does not only take place on the level of governments, but also on an
individual level between people.  Individuals must shift from constant blame and guilt to
take responsibility and move forward.  Though I believe in collective responsibility, I
definitely don't believe in collective guilt. Breaking down the stereotypes is realized on
an individual basis by getting to know the other as people with dreams and hopes.</p>  
                         
<p>It has been said, "Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely." In this
unbelievable imbalance of power between Palestine and Israel, a third party without
any direct interests involved may aide in balancing the scales of equality.  From the
outside, a third-party will be able to address the situation with a holistic approach;
including political, economical, social, psychological, and educational issues.  The
following story is about a poor devout man, his old blind mother, and a bitter barren
wife, which illustrates the role of the third party.</p>  
                        
<p><i>After 12 years of prayer to relieve his family's suffering, God wondered what one thing he truly
desired.  He went home to consult with his mother and wife.  His mother wanted her sight back so she could
see again.  His wife wanted a son who could take care of them, and perhaps bring wealth to the family.  The
mother overheard the conversation between her son and his wife and became very aggressive unto the wife. 
The wife fought back, pulling out hair, as the terrible fight ensued.</i></p><i>  

<p>The poor man ran from the house to a wise advisor, and told him his dilemma.  "My mother wants
eyesight, my wife wants a son, and I, I wish for a bit of money so we can eat everyday.  What shall I ask? 
Whose needs come first?"</p>  

<p>The advisor thought for a moment, then he answered: "You must not choose for any one of your family
alone, but for the good of all.  Ask wisely.  You will say, -'Oh Lord, I ask nothing for myself; my wife asks
nothing for herself; but my mother is blind, and her desire is, before she dies to see her grandson eating
milk and rice from a golden bowl'."</p></i>  

  <p>From the Folk tale: Wisdom of the Mediator - Trinidad</p>
    
<p>The Pyramid of peace is a three-sided figure.  The third party is the side that
provides the support for the Oppressor and Oppressed to reach the goal of peace and
equality.  Without the support, the other two sides wobble against each other fighting to
stay upright, until they both collapse into the ruins.  As stated in the story above, the
task is finding- 'the good of all'.</p>
