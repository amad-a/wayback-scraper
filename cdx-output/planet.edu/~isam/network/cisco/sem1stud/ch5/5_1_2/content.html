        Unshielded twisted-pair cable</i> (<i>UTP</i>) <img border="0" src="/planet.edu/~isam/network/cisco/sem1stud/images/1.gif" align="absmiddle" width="12" height="12">
          is a four-pair wire medium - composed of
        pairs of wires - used in a variety of networks. Each of the 8 individual
          copper wires in the UTP cable is covered by insulating material. In
          addition, each pair of wires are twisted around each other. This type of cable relies solely on the cancellation effect, produced by the
        twisted wire pairs, to limit signal degradation caused by EMI and RFI. To further reduce
        crosstalk between the pairs in UTP cable, the number of twists in the wire pairs varies.
        Like STP cable, UTP cable must follow precise specifications as to how many twists or
        braids are permitted per foot of cable.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">When used as
        a networking medium, UTP cable has four pairs of either 22 or 24 gauge copper wire. UTP
        used as a networking medium has an impedance of 100 ohms. This differentiates it from
        other types of twisted-pair wiring such as that used for telephone wiring. Because UTP has
        an external diameter of approximately .43 cm, its small size can be advantageous during
        installation. Since UTP can be used with most of the major networking architectures, it
        continues to grow in popularity. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unshielded twisted-pair cable has many advantages. It is
        easy to install and is less expensive than other types of networking media. In fact, UTP
        costs less per meter than any other type of LAN cabling, <img border="0" src="/planet.edu/~isam/network/cisco/sem1stud/images/2.gif" align="absmiddle" width="12" height="12">
        however its real advantage is its
        size. Since it has such a small external diameter, UTP does not fill up wiring ducts as
        rapidly as other types of cable. This can be an extremely important factor to consider,
        particularly when installing a network in an older building. Also, when UTP cable is
        installed using an RJ connector, potential sources of network noise are greatly reduced,
        and a good solid connection is practically guaranteed.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are disadvantages in using
          twisted-pair cabling. UTP cable is more prone to electrical noise and
          interference than other types of networking media, and the distance
          between signal boosts is shorter for UTP than it is for coaxial and
          fiber optic cables.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While UTP was once considered slower at
          transmitting data than other types of cable. However, this is no
          longer true. In fact, today, UTP is considered the fastest
          copper-based media.</font></p>
