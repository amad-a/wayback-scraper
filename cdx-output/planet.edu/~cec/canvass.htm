<h2>The first step to the Palestinian elections: <br>
the Electoral Register</h2>

<p>
From November 12 to December 2, 1995, Palestinians throughout
the West Bank - including Jerusalem - and the Gaza Strip were
called upon to register for the first Palestinian elections to
be held on January 20, 1996. To assure that all Palestinians eligible
to vote can make use of their civic rights and register for the
Electoral Register a vast canvass was organized.
</p><p>
The responsibility for the voters registration, as well as for
the preparation and the conduct of the elections, lies with the
Central Election Commission (CEC) which has been appointed by
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). To fulfill its tasks
the CEC has established District Election Offices (DEOs) and Polling
Station Commissions (PSCs). Each PSC is responsible for the conduct
of the canvass, registration, polling and the count within its
polling district.
</p><p>
During the canvass, all over the 16 election districts about 7000
teachers - in their function as members of the local PSCs - were
going from door to door for the initial voters registration. Their
task was to ask every Palestinian over the age of 17 to fill in
a registration form containing name, sex, date and place of birth
as well as the address. Where a person was absent from the home
on all visits of the PSC (e.g. persons in jail, under long term
hospital care or traveling for a long trip), a relative could
fill in and sign the form on his or her behalf. If this person
will be at home on January 20, he or she has the right to vote.
</p><p>
Resulting from the canvass, the CEC published a draft Electors
Register on December 10. It will be displayed in each polling
district at the site of the PSC. Potential voters then had five
days for registration claims or appeals. The final Electoral Register
was published on December 30, 1995. The same day an additional
registration period started. Registrations will be open until
January 5, 1996 and give especially released prisoners who have
not been registered by their families the possibility to make
use of their civic rights to register as voters. A supplementary
register will be published on January 17.
</p><p>
To inform the Palestinian population about the importance of the
first elections, a vast civic education and awareness campaign
was started on November 3, 1995. This campaign contained advertising
in the Voice of Palestine radio, in the Television of Palestine
and in local newspapers as well as posters, stickers and banners,
and was supported largely by the European Union. The European
Union also supports the preparation for the first Palestinian
elections through technical assistance and is action as coordinating
body for international observer delegations as stated in the Interim
Agreement.
