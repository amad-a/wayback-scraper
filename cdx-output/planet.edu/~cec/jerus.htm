<p>
On January 20, 1996, Palestinians in Jerusalem will have the right
to participate in the first Palestinian Elections as well as the
Palestinians from other parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
The electoral procedure however will show some differences. Some
Palestinians living in the areas illegally annexed by Israel in
1980 - such as the Old City, Jerusalem City and Beit Hanina -
will vote through post offices in Jerusalem. These will be the
post offices of Salah-a-Din, Jaffa Gate, Shuafat, Beit Hanina
and the Mount of Olives. This procedure concerns a number of voters
correspending to about ten polling stations. However most of the
electors in the Jerusalem constituency will vote in one of the
154 polling stations directly controlled by the Jerusalem District
Election Office the same way Palestinians in the other parts of
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are voting.
</p><p>
The Palestinians who will vote through post offices in Jerusalem
will be notified of the relevant post office by Electoral Registration
Cards provided by the Central Election Commission (CEC). On presentation
of these cards the electors that present themselves in the post
offices on the day of the elections will receive the two ballot
papers for the election of the Ra'ees and the Council as well
as two envelopes. Electors will mark the ballot papers at the
post office counter, then place them in the envelopes to be inserted
in special receptacles. At the end of the day, these receptacles
shall be sealed and transported to the District Election Office
for Jerusalem which will be responsible for the counting and totaling
of the votes.
</p><p>
Palestinians from Jerusalem can run for seats in the Council or
for the presidency. However, they are required to have a secondary
residence outside Jerusalem.
</p><p>
The election process in Jerusalem is open to international and
domestic observers.
