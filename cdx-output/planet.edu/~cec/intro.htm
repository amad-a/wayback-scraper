<center><hr><h2>The first Palestinian Elections: <br>
A key element for a just, lasting and comprehensive peace</h2>
<hr></center>
<p>
On January 20, 1996, for the first time in history Palestinians
in the West Bank, Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip have the opportunity
to vote for the Ra'ees (President) of the Palestinian National
Authority and the Palestinian Council. Already, weeks before that
historic date, according to the Declaration of Principles signed
in Washington DC on September 13, 1993, and the Interim Agreement
of September 28, 1995, populated areas within the West Bank will
come under the rule of the Palestinian National Authority. This
follows the establishment of the Authority in Gaza and Jericho
in 1994. By the end of December 1995, the Israeli military forces
finished their redeployment except in Hebron, which will be the
last town to be evacuated by the Israeli forces in March. The
Israeli forces will later withdraw from unpopulated areas, as
specified in the Interim Agreement, within 18 months from the
date of the inauguration of the Palestinian Council.
</p><p>
The Palestinian voters will elect an 88 member Council which will
take over from the Palestinian National Authority and which will
have powers and responsibilities within the Interim Agreement.
The Council will have both legislative and executive powers. The
President of the Palestinian National Authority, who will also
be elected on January 20, 1996, will be an <i>ex officio</i> additional
member of the Council.
</p><p>
The establishment of these structures will mark an essential step
towards a permanent and peaceful settlement that will end decades
of confrontation in the region. As stated in the agreements with
the Government of the State of Israel, comprehensive Palestinian
self-rule shall be reached not later than 1999 and lead to a "just,
lasting and comprehensive peace settlement and historic reconciliation".

The following fact sheets compiled by the Press Office of the
Central Election Commission (CEC) are designed to help journalists
understand the details and the background of the first Palestinian
elections.
