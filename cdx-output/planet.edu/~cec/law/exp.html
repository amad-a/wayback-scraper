Explanatory Notice</h1>

<hr>

<p>
The Palestinian Elections Law of 1995 expresses the responsibility
that the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian
National Authority undertake before the Palestinian People and
our national rights, and their commitment to the holding of general
elections, as a modern means of achieving a representation for
the people based on democratic principles, which will allow us
to exercise the government and to promulgate the laws that will
rule our destiny and the building up of our future.
</p><p>
The fact that this Law affects only the inhabitants of the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank, including Jerusalem, due to the conditions
and circumstances and to the nature of the interim period, does
not undermine the rights of the Palestinians of the Diaspora and,
above all, the refugees, exiled and expelled, who will have the
opportunity to exercise their rights in the elections that will
follow their return to the Nation.
</p><p>
The establishment of the Palestinian National Authority and the
extension of its sovereignty to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
has created the adequate conditions for the holding of free and
direct elections, under international supervision, which will
allow our people to exercise the democratic right to govern themselves.
</p><p>
Elections are a right and a duty imposed by the honour of citizenship
and the belonging to the Nation, as well as by the people's will
and their democratic choice, and this Law realizes these citizen's
rights and duties without submitting them to any restriction.
</p><p>
The holding of elections for the position of President of the
National Authority and for the membership of the Council, and
their consequent status as members of the Palestinian National
Council, serves to ratify the unity of the Palestinian People
wherever they may be. This is an important step forward in the
way to the realization of their national rights and of their just
demands, and in the building up of their future and of institutions
responsible to the sovereign people; and to the establishment
of a democratic and parliamentary system, based upon freedom of
opinion, freedom of parties, submission of the minority to the
decisions of the majority and the respect of the minority by the
majority, social justice, equality, prevention of discrimination
in the exercise of public rights based on religion, colour, race,
or between man and woman, the rule of law and the independence
of the judiciary, and based upon full allegiance to the Palestinian
tradition, civic and spiritual, and upon the centuries long concord
among religions.
</p><p>
The Law provides for the holding of elections for the position
of President of the National Executive Authority and for the membership
of the Council. The Council shall have its own President, who
shall be elected by and from among the Council members. All of
which serves to ratify the democratic character of the government
and the principle of the separation of powers.
</p><p>
The provisions of this Law take into account the conditions of
our people during the interim period and their need for a solid
political structure that will preserve their national interests,
and for a system of government constructed and based upon political
pluralism, without any undermining of the right of all to present
their candidatures, either in an independent manner or by means
of parties' or electoral coalitions' lists.
</p><p>
The Law forbids the possibility of voting or being nominated in
more than one constituency and extends this prohibition to the
members of the Palestinian National Council; thus no member of
the Palestinian National Council may be nominated for election
in any of the sixteen electoral constituencies, unless he or she
transfers [to them]<a href="/planet.edu/~cec/law/#fn1">[<sup>1</sup>]</a> his or her registration in the relevant
Diaspora constituency of the Palestinian National Council.
</p><p>
The elections shall be hold based on the majority electoral system,
multi-member constituencies and open lists, this being the system
followed by the majority of the States of the world; the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank, including Jerusalem, shall be considered
one sole constituency for the election of the President of the
Palestinian National Executive Authority, whereas the whole of
the territories will be divided into 16 electoral constituencies,
taking into account the distribution of the population [for the
election of the Council].
</p><p>
The Law ensures the freedom and fairness and the democratic character
of the electoral process, and the equal treatment for all in the
official communication media.
