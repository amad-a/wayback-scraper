<p>
The new Central Election Commission (CEC) appointed by a Presidential
Decree on December 21, 1995 is responsible for the organization
and supervision of the elections for the Palestinian Council and
the President of the Palestinian National Authority to be held
on January 20, 1996. Its tasks and competencies are defined by
the Electoral Law published on December 7, 1995. The CEC consists
of ten members, mainly university rectors and lawyers. Its chairman
is <b>Mahmoud Abbas </b>(Abu Mazen). Abu Mazen played a key role
in negotiating the Oslo Agreement. He signed the Declaration of
Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements on behalf of
the PLO in Washington, D.C. on September 13, 1993.

<p>
For the preparation and conduct of the elections the CEC has established
the District Election Offices (DEOs) and Polling Station Commissions
(PSCs).
</p><p>
The first task of the preparation of the elections was the <b>voters
registration</b> which was conducted in a huge canvass throughout
the West Bank, including Jerusalem, and in the Gaza Strip. A draft
Electoral Register was published on December 10, 1995. After examination
of claims and appeals the final Electoral Register was published
on December 30, 1995. A supplementary register will be published
on January 17, 1996.
</p><p>
The <b>registration of candidates</b> was open from December 14
to December 23 and from December 30 to December 31. After the
end of the nominations period the CEC published the Provisional
Statement of Persons Nominated. After a three days period for
appeals and objections to nominations the CEC will publish the
Final Statement of Persons Nominated on January 5, 1996. On the
same day the election campaign will start.
</p><p>
For the <b>election campaign </b>the CEC will publish a list of
all venues and facilities available for rallies and meetings.
It is also responsible to assure that the campaign activities
correspond to the conditions set out in the Electoral law.
</p><p>
On the <b>election day </b>the CEC through the DEOs and PSCs organises
the polling and the count of the votes. It then publishes the
results of the votes.
</p><p>
The CEC is also responsible for the co-operation with the <b>International
and Domestic Observers.</b> The CEC will supply observers with
all information they ask for. Observers must be accredited by
the CEC. Invited international observer delegations are being
coordinated by the European Union through the headquarters of
the EU-Electoral Unit in Ramallah.
</p><p>
The CEC also deals with <b>complaints </b>such as offences of
a candidate against the electoral law or alleged discrimination
of candidates. A special Elections Appeals Court will deal with
questions that cannot be solved on a lower level.
</p><p>
The preparations of the elections were first conducted under the
responsability of the Palestinian Commission for Local Government
and Elections (PCLGE) appointed by a Decree of President Yasser
Arafat in December 1993. This commission that later was renamed
as Central Election Commission acted under the authority of the
minister for local government affairs, Dr. Saeb Erakat, and was
especially responsible for the voters registration campaign.
