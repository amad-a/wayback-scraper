<h2>The Palestinian Council, its Executive Authority and the President
of the Palestinian National Authority - Institutions and competences </h2>
<hr>
</center>
<p>
On January 20, 1996, Palestinians in the West Bank, including
Jerusalem, and in the Gaza Strip are called upon to participate
in the first Palestinian elections. Electors will have to fill
two ballot papers: one for the President of the Palestinian National
Authority, and the second for the Palestinian Council. The President
and the Council will be elected for a transitional period in which
a final agreement with Israel has to be negotiated. This transitional
period - according to the agreements already reached with Israel
- should not exceed May 1999.
</p><p>
The <b>Council</b> will have 88 members, with the President becoming
<i>ex officio</i> its 89th member. The Council has legislative
and executive powers. It will formulate and conduct Palestinian
policies in the spheres within the jurisdiction of the Council,
which include for example economic affairs and development, education,
local government and health. The Council will also supervise the
implementation of these policies. One of the most important tasks
will be the formulation of the Palestinian positions for the upcoming
negotiations with Israel for the permanent settlement as envisaged
in the Declaration of Principles. These negotiations will include
issues such as Jerusalem, settlements, refugees, borders and security
arrangements. The Interim Agreement, signed on September 28, 1995,
also provides that the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO)
may conduct and sign agreements with states and international
organisations for the benefit of the organisations concerning
economic co-operation as well as cultural, scientific and educational
matters.
</p><p>
The Council is also responsible for internal security and public
order in the populated areas as specified in the Interim Agreement.
The Council therefore is establishing a strong police force. To
coordinate on security matters, Palestinians and Israelis established
a Joint Coordination and Cooperation Committee for Mutual Security
Purposes as well as corresponding regional and district institutions.
The Council will elect its own President from among its members,
who will convene and conduct its meetings and draft its agenda.
This position is incompatible with the position of the President
of the Palestinian National Authority.
</p><p>
The Council will have an executive authority, the Palestinian
National Authority. This authority - headed by the President of
the Palestinian National Authority who will also be elected on
January 20, 1996 - will exercise the executive power in the spheres
under the responsibility of the Council and report back to the
Council. Most of the members of the National Authority will be
members of the Council, chosen and proposed to the Council by
the President and approved by the Council. The President also
has the right to appoint some persons to the National Authority,
who are not members of the Council, to exercise executive authority
and participate in government tasks. The number of these persons
shall not exceed twenty percent of the total membership of the
National Authority. The members appointed by the President do
not have the right to vote in the Council.
</p><p>
The <b>President of the Palestinian National Authority</b> has
the power to initiate legislation or to present the proposed legislation
to the Council. He also has the power to promulgate the laws approved
by the law. The President has the right to issue regulations and
secondary legislation relating to any matters specified and within
the scope laid down in any primary legislation approved by the
Council.
</p><p>
The President assigns portfolios to the members of the National
Authority and may hold at the same time any specific portfolios
with executive powers. He and the other members of the Authority
are accountable to the Council. The President will report periodically
to the Council about his policies, implementation of his political
programme, and in general about the activities of the National
Authority.
</p><p>
The Council has the right to question the President, to criticise
his activities, and vote against laws proposed by the President
and the National Authority. The President shall however not be
subject to votes of no-confidence by the Council. The Council
may however hold a no-confidence vote against any other member
of the National Authority. If such a vote is approved, the President
shall remove the member from office. The President does not have
the power to change the organization or structure of the Council
or to dissolve the Council.
