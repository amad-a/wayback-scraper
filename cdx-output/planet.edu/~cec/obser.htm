<center><hr><h2>Election Observers</h2>
<hr>
</center>
<p>
Marking the beginning of a new, democratic chapter in the history
of Palestine, the first Palestinian elections to be held on January
20, 1996, are open to international and domestic observation.
This applies not only to the elections as such but to all stages
of the election process including registration of voters, nomination
of candidates and the campaign. The observers will be asked to
assess whether all stages of the electoral process are fair and
free.
</p><p>
International Observers have been invited especially from the
European Union and the United States of America, as well as from
the Russian Federation, Canada, Norway, Switzerland, Jordan, Egypt,
South Africa, China, Malta, Cyprus, Japan, the United Nations,
the Islamic Conference Organisation, the Movement of Non-Aligned
Nations and the Organisation of African Unity. Other observers,
including those representing non-governmental organisations, will
also be present. The European Union plans to send 300 observers,
probably the biggest single group of observers. All together about
1000 international observers are expected to come to Palestine.
</p><p>
The Interim Agreement, signed on September 28, 1995, guarantees
to all international observers the freedom of movement and the
freedom to have contact with any person at any time and anywhere
and to attend all election related events. Observer delegations
can at any point make comments or representations about the conduct
of the elections to the Palestinian Central Election Commission
(CEC), which shall consider them and reply appropriately. Observers
may also at any stage during and following the elections issue
statements and hold press conferences as to their findings.
</p><p>
All observers must be accredited by the Central Election Commission
and will then receive accreditation cards. Whenever and wherever
on duty, the international observers will wear a distinctive outfit
(caps, shirts, jackets etc., including the words "INTERNATIONAL
OBSERVER" in Arabic and English).
</p><p>
The European Union acts as the coordinator for the activity of
observer delegations. Its Electoral Unit is based in Ramallah
(Tel.: 02-995 68 44/5; Fax: 02-998 63 81).
</p><p>
Domestic observers are also invited to observe the Palestinian
elections. They also need to be accredited by the CEC. They will
enjoy freedom of speech and movement and the freedom to have contact
with any person at any time and anywhere and to attend all election
related events, as guaranteed in the Interim Agreement.
