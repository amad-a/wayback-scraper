<center><hr><h2>The electoral law</h2>
<hr></center>
<p>
The electoral law signed by President Yasser Arafat on Thursday,
December 7, 1995, contains regulations for the nomination process,
the election campaign, the conduct of the election and the counting
of the votes.
</p><p>
As basic principle the law establishes a <b>majority voting system</b>
with 16 constituencies for the election of the Palestinian Council
and one single constituency for the election of the President
of the Palestinian National Authority. Of the 16 constituencies,
five are located in the Gaza Strip, 11 cover the territory of
the West Bank, including Jerusalem. Each elector will have one
vote for the election of the President and as many votes for the
Council as his or her constituency has seats in the Council. If
for example a constituency is entitled to send five members to
the Council, each elector has up to five votes. Elector can distribute
their votes to candidates belonging to one or more parties and
may also vote for only one or two candidates.
</p><p>
In the election for the President the candidate who gets the highest
number of votes is elected. If there is going to be only one candidate,
he or she must however receive more valid votes than there are
blanks or invalid ones.
</p><p>
In the election for the Council the best-placed candidates win
the seats of their constituency. In three constituencies there
is however a special <b>quota for Christians</b>. A second special
regulation concerns the constituency of Nablus where an additional
seat is reserved for the <b>Samaritan</b> minority.
</p><p>
The <b>nomination of candidates</b> was open to parties and to
independent candidates. Candidates running for the presidency
must present 5000 signatures supporting their candidacy and pay
a deposit of 3000 USD to the Ministry of Finance. Candidates for
the Council must present 500 signatures and pay a deposit of 1000
USD. The deposit is going to be refunded to the candidates that
are elected. Candidates must be Palestinians, have a valid address
in an area under the jurisdiction of the Council and be at least
35 years old when running for the presidency and 30 years for
the Council. The candidates that present their candidacy first
will appear on top of the ballot papers of their constituency.
The ballot paper will show the name of the candidate, his or her
party and the logo or the initials of the party or his or her
status as independent candidate, as well a space to mark (x) for
the candidate.
</p><p>
Nominations were open from December 14 until December 23, and
from December 30 to December 31. On January 5, the Central Election
Commission the Final Statement of Persons Nominated and on the
same day, the election campaign starts.
</p><p>
The law also contains precise regulations for the conduct of the<b>
campaign</b>. The Central Election Commission (CEC) will publish
a list of sites for campaign rallies. Campaigning in the buildings
of the Authority and in mosques and churches is prohibited. All
candidates shall also have access to the official Palestinian
media. Equal media opportunities will be allocated to candidates
of parties, as well as to independent candidates. In addition,
the official Palestinian news and current affaires media must
maintain a fair balance of coverage between parties and candidates
during the campaign.
</p><p>
The law contains strict regulations concerning illegal offences
during the campaign. Foreign funding of campaigns is prohibited.
The election campaign ends on January 18, 1996. There will be
no campaigning on polling day and the day before.
</p><p>
Complaints concerning for example the behaviour of candidates
or alleged discrimination against candidates can be addressed
to the Central Election Commission. An Election Appeals Court
will be established to deal with disputes that cannot be solved
on a lower level.
</p><p>
On election day the polling stations will be open from 7 a.m.
until 7 p.m. The Polling Station Commissions will then count the
votes in the polling stations and will transmit the results to
the District Election Offices (DEO). The DEOs will total these
results and transmit the figures to the CEC that will publish
them.
