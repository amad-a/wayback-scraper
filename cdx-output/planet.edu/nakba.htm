<p></p><blockquote><i><b>Nakba</b>: The catastrophe which befell the Palestinian people in
1948, as Zionist gangs
massacred innocent men, women, and children, pillaged their homes,
and destroyed their
villages and towns.&nbsp; Thus, the creation of the State of Israel
over usurped Palestinian
land led to the dual injustice of the dispossession and exile of the
majority of the
Palestinian people and the languishing of the rest under occupation.</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
We, the Palestinian offspring of this sacred land, advocates of universal
values,
seekers of peace and freedom, the living testament of endurance and
human dignity in the
face of adversity, victims of half a century of perpetual night of&nbsp;
occupation and
dispersion -
Declare our resounding presence in time and place, despite all attempts
to uproot us
from the land which has borne our name from the beginning of time.&nbsp;
Not emerging from
the darkness of myth or legend, we were born in the pristine daylight
of history on this
land which gave birth to the most ancient of civilizations.&nbsp; On
this land humanity found
its way to building its first home, to planting its first wheat grain,
to creating its
first alphabet.&nbsp; From the hills of Jerusalem, the first prayers
of gratitude rose to the
Creator.&nbsp; Our land, modest in size, hosted vast cultures and civilizations,
both in
conflict and in harmony,&nbsp; our own culture emerging from the fullness
of this diverse and
rich heritage.&nbsp; Our human history began with the history of humanity.&nbsp;
Our Arab history
began with the history of the Arabs. The consciousness of our national
history began
with our resistance to conquest and greed, which beset our land.

</p><p>Today, as we confront half a century of Nakba and resistance, pained
at the continuing
tragedy of our recent past, we cast our sights to the future that we
are molding in hope
and in the promise of freedom and justice. For we have vanquished all
attempts at our
obliteration and denial and at the eradication of the name of Palestine
from the map of
Palestine.&nbsp; On the fiftieth anniversary of one of the greatest
crimes of the age,
committed against the gentle people and land of Palestine, we stand
in reverence in the
sight of the martyrs who had offered their lives as a libation to the
continuity of the
land and its immortal name, in defense of our identity and sovereign
existence on our
land – a land infused with the words of God to humanity as with our
ancestral blood.<br>
&gt;From the bereavement of mothers, to the captivity of prisoners, to
the exile of
generations,&nbsp; we stand in awe at the heroism of the ordinary individual
and the
collective will to endure, both Palestinian and Arab. Victims of a
myth "A land without
a people for a people without a land," we dared to intrude on the course
of history and
expose the falsehood that sought our denial.&nbsp; Slated for national
obliteration and
severance from the land, we have affirmed our identity and ties to
our homeland,
snatching our reality from the jaws of oblivion.

</p><p>Four hundred and eighteen living and thriving Palestinian villages were
razed to the
ground in 1948 by the Zionist perpetrators of the myth and the crime.&nbsp;
Terrorized,
massacred, and expelled, most of the Palestinian nation was reduced
to the status of
refugees and stateless persons at the mercy of various host countries.&nbsp;
Bereft of their
birthright, the Palestinian refugees carried Palestine in their hearts
along with their
land deeds and the keys to their homes. Both the topography and demography
of our
reality remain alive in our collective memory and continuity.&nbsp;
We have refused to adopt
their distorted version of our history and we remain advocates and
witnesses of the
authentic narrative of Palestinian endurance and the will to live.

</p><p>&gt;From revolution, to Intifada, to nation building, we have extracted
recognition from the
world. The dual injustice of exile and occupation could not break the
will of a people
bent on achieving freedom, dignity and the redemption of history.&nbsp;
Thus, it was the PLO
which first offered the olive branch as a genuine alternative to the
gun.&nbsp; Peace was in
sight, but not appeasement or capitulation.&nbsp; The PLO, the embodiment
of our collective
national identity, the guardian of the integrity of our past and the
vehicle to the
fulfillment of our future, has ensured the independence of our utterance
and our will
and has shaped the course of our destiny.&nbsp; It obtained recognition
from the
international community for the Palestinian people’s right to self
determination and the
right of return as anchors to secure us against the gales of loss and
denial. Above all,
Jerusalem, more than a right, is the soul of our being and the essence
of harmony.

</p><p>Our commitment to democracy and the politics of inclusion were expressed
in the PLO’s
historical proposal of a secular, pluralistic, democratic state in
Palestine.&nbsp; While
Zionism insisted on a racist exclusivity which denied the humanity
and rights of the
other, we sought to affirm tolerance and celebrate diversity. The inclusive
sharing of
the historical land of Palestine having been denied by the Israeli
drive for exclusive
possession, we formulated the alternative of sharing the land on the
basis of the two
state solution.&nbsp; Such a solution would meet the imperative of
international legality as
defined by UN resolution 181, and would grant the Palestinian people
relative justice on
their land.&nbsp; It would also grant reprieve for tortured Jerusalem
to be celebrated as an
eternal city and our eternal capital.

</p><p>The transition from the historical memory of Palestine as a homeland
to the collective
endeavor to establish Palestine as a geo-political state on part of
historical
Palestine, signals a painful and difficult transformation in the political
discourse as
well as in the national ethos of the Palestinian people.&nbsp; While
it demands recognition
as a conciliatory compromise of historical magnitude, it must not be
misconstrued as
self-negation or weakness. Rather, it demands an immediate and unequivocal
recognition
of our legitimacy and right to sovereignty as a nation among equals.&nbsp;
The vision,
courage and moral magnanimity of the victim reaching out to the oppressor
must not be
met with further rejection, denial and victimization.

</p><p>The world now is called upon to undertake not only a recognition of
guilt and admission
of culpability in relation to the Palestinian people, but also to undertake
an active
and massive process of rectification to secure the implementation of
Palestinian rights.
&nbsp; The international community is called upon to intervene effectively
to rescue the
peace process in the face of current Israeli extremism and politics
of threat,
intimidation and power, rather than succumbing&nbsp; to Israeli demands,
pressures, and
unilateral policies and measures.&nbsp; In pursuing a policy of colonization
and land
confiscation, reneging on signed agreements, negating the terms of
reference of the
peace process, violating the timetable and denying the agenda of permanent
status talks,
while continuing the imposition of collective punitive measures on
the Palestinian
people, Israel is not only attempting to derail the peace process but
also to destroy
any prospects of peace in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp; In reviving fundamentalism,
hostility, and
distrust, Israel is also drawing the whole region outside the course
of contemporary
history and into an anachronistic future of conflict and violence.

</p><p>True stability, security and prosperity can emanate only from a genuine
peace which
incorporates the basic principle of justice.&nbsp; Such is the Palestinian
vision and the
Palestinian collective endeavor. No amount of pain or suffering can
justify the
victimization and infliction of injustice on others.&nbsp; While we
extend a compassionate
recognition of the unspeakable Jewish suffering during the horror of
the holocaust, we
find it unconscionable that the suffering of our people be denied or
even rationalized.
&nbsp;As victims, we seek to prevent the recurrence of pain, regardless
of the identity of
the perpetrator or the recipient.&nbsp; No country or nation must pretend
to be, or must be
perceived to be, above the law or beyond accountability.&nbsp; If Israel
seeks recognition
and legitimacy then it must comply with the norms and laws that govern
the behavior of
civilized nations.&nbsp; The arrogance of power may prevail, but only
temporarily.&nbsp; Only a
just peace can lay claim to durability and permanence.

</p><p>We do not seek to be captives of history or victims of the past.&nbsp;
The Palestinian people
have launched a redemptive journey to the future.&nbsp; From the ashes
of our sorrow and
loss, we are resurrecting a nation celebrating life and hope. We will
not surrender. Nor
will we lose faith in a just and genuine peace that will enable us
to exercise our right
to independence and sovereignty.&nbsp; Fifty years since the Nakba
were not spent in grief
over a painful memory.&nbsp; The past has not entirely departed, nor
has the future entirely
arrived yet.&nbsp; The present is an open potential to struggle.&nbsp;
For 50 years, Palestinian
history has stood witness to epics of perseverance and resistance,
to confronting the
implications, consequences and injustices of the Nakba.&nbsp; For half
a century Palestinian
history became a living pledge to future generations for their right
to a life of
freedom and dignity on their own land.&nbsp; We have begun painstakingly
the nation-building
process, to ensure a free homeland for a free people.&nbsp; The state
of Palestine is
returning to contemporary history after 50 years of forced eviction,
a state embodying
the principles and practice of democracy, separation of powers, human
rights, gender
equality, accountability, and the rule of law.&nbsp; Despite the present
constraints of
geography and transition, our vision remains expansive and unfettered.&nbsp;
For we thrive on
the spirit of resistance and the longing for freedom, motivated by
that will which
produced the luminous flame of the Intifada.&nbsp; Born in Palestine,
no other land gave us
birth.&nbsp; No other can claim our future.&nbsp; Nor can Jerusalem
be replaced as our capital or
extracted from our land and our being:&nbsp; It is the home of our
souls and the soul of our
homeland, forever.
