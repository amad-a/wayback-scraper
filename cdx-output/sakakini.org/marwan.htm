The Centre hosted the&nbsp; exhibit of Syrian artist Marwan Qassab Bashi.
Marwan is one of the most important Arab artists working today, and enjoys
great fame in Europe. This exhibit,&nbsp; organized in cooperation with
the Ramallah Goethe Institut, was held as a result of&nbsp; Marwan’s wish
to donate&nbsp; to&nbsp; “the children of Palestine” a collection of 75
etchings of great value on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the
Nakba. These were distributed between the Sakakini and Bir Zeit University.

<p>Professor Jorn Merkert, director of the Berlin Museum of Modern Art
and chief expert on Marwan's work, attended the opening, commented a short
documentary film on Marwan after the opening, and gave a lecture and slide
show at the Bir Zeit opening.

</p><p>This important gestures underscores the solidarity of international
artists with the struggle of the Palestinian people, and the gift will
serve as the nucleus for a museum of contemporary art works donated by
international&nbsp; artists, in solidarity with the people of Palestine,
that the Sakakini will try to establish in Ramallah.

</p><p>The exhibit featured mainly prints and etchings that showcased the most
important phases of Marwan’s career: faces, people standing, face-landscapes,
marionettes, etc.. The donation also featured a number of unique prints
(1/1) and&nbsp; watercolors. The exhibit’s poster was also a rare limited
edition signed serigraphy.

</p><p><a href="/sakakini.org/marpic.jpg" style="">Marwan</a> was born in
1934 in Damascus, and has studied fine arts in Berlin. He&nbsp; participated
at the Venice Biennial, the Dokumenta, the Paris FIAC, and held numerous
solo exhibitions throughout the world, among them at Paris’ Bibliothéque
Nationale and Institut du Monde Arabe, and Amman’s Darat el Funoun. He
is considered one of the leading visual artists of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Germany,
and many of his works can be found in European museums.
