﻿<h2﻿ ﻿align="center" ﻿="">﻿The Siege﻿﻿
﻿<div﻿ ﻿align="left" ﻿="">﻿
﻿<b﻿>﻿
      Dear all: 
﻿﻿<p﻿>﻿<div﻿ ﻿align="justify" ﻿="">﻿
I am the director of the Khalil Sakakini Cultural
       Centre in Ramallah (Http://www.sakakini.org). As I am
       under siege at home, i am sending out this email to
       journalist friends, ﻿&amp;﻿ others, to ask to please get our
       message out ﻿&amp;﻿ disseminated further.
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       I hope this message will not become morbid fodder for
       chain emails to draw pity, or prayers, or donations,
       but rather actions. We are doing our bit by resisting
       ﻿&amp;﻿ or standing steadfast, ﻿&amp;﻿ ask the world to please do
       its bit in the name of our common humanity, each
       according to his her/own capacity. We do not want to
       become the red indians of the Arab world, but simply
       want to live free, in peace ﻿&amp;﻿ dignity on this land.
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       I will start by a few paragraphs' overview of the
       situation "live" as i see it, ﻿&amp;﻿ follow it with 9
       suggestions of what we would please like to see happen
       in the media ﻿&amp;﻿ elsewhere in the outside world. 
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       Firstly tonight -Sunday- we have heard numerous
       reports of 30 Palestinian policemen executed in cold
       blood by Israeli soldiers in a building where they
       sought refuge on Irssal street in Ramallah. This was
       after 5 Palestinian officers were executed by being
       shot to the head ﻿&amp;﻿ then had their corpses thrown on
       the pavement for hours on Friday. Ambulances are
       prevented from reaching their destinations ﻿&amp;﻿ 2
       hospitals have either been broken into (Arabcare) or
       shot at (Nazer Maternity Hospital). If this continues,
       it will be another Chechnya or Sarajevo in the making.
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       Personally, I have been shut at home since Friday
       morning, like all the tens of thousands of inhabitants
       of Ramallah ﻿&amp;﻿ El-Bireh, ﻿&amp;﻿ no prospect of an end soon.
       We did not have electricity for one day, but thank God
       it got reestablished today Sunday. 
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       One of the employees of the Sakakini Center had the
       Israeli army burst into his village (Kobar) yesterday,
       destroy belongings ﻿&amp;﻿ arrest his younger brother,
       alongside 30 other young men from the village.
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       The cleaning lady of the Center lives in a house with
       an outhouse for toilets. For 3 days the Israelis have
       been posted by the door to her house ﻿&amp;﻿ preventing all
       exit. When the eldest today sneaked out to the
       outhouse, the Israelis caught him ﻿&amp;﻿ beat him. His
       school teacher father tried to intervene, the Israelis
       beat him ﻿&amp;﻿ arrested him.
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       One of the board members of our center was arrested
       with all the employees of the office building where he
       was working late Thursday night. They were all
       blindfolded ﻿&amp;﻿ had their hands tied ﻿&amp;﻿ placed in one
       room for 16 hours. The Israelis destroyed some office
       furniture ﻿&amp;﻿ stole hard drives from computers. They all
       untied themselves once they realized the Israelis had
       gone on to bigger prey..
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       My brother in law ﻿&amp;﻿ his wife ﻿&amp;﻿ their 3 under-10 year
       old kids are without phone ﻿&amp;﻿ electricity since Friday
       ﻿&amp;﻿ cannot go live w/ someone else as they would be shot
       at. 
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       My next door neighbor's 70+ year old father lives
       near Yasser Arafat's office. The Israelis broke into
       his home Friday, broke everything w/ the butt of their
       rifles (TV, sinks, furniture, etc.. ) ﻿&amp;﻿ then stole
       some money. 
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       There are reports also of Israeli soldiers breaking
       into banks ﻿&amp;﻿ change offices ﻿&amp;﻿ jewelery stores ﻿&amp;﻿
       stealing money ﻿&amp;﻿ jewelry.
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       In El Bireh, they arrested Saturday 150 young men
       between 16-45 years of age after calling out for men
       of this age bracket to get out, they are grouping them
       in Ramallah's Old City.
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       The only local private TV station in town that used to
       air hourly news ﻿&amp;﻿ advice (Watan TV) has been seized by
       the Israelis on Friday, ﻿&amp;﻿ they are now airing
       pornographic films. Journalists have been ordered out
       of Ramallah today Sunday.
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       All neighborhoods are abuzz with talk of who is next
       in Israeli home incursions. As for me ﻿&amp;﻿ many others,
       there is the human instinct of crying out for help
       when in danger.
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       What we have done: With our means we have made phone
       calls to appeal for help ﻿&amp;﻿ pressure on the
       international community to a number of high level
       officials in a number of neigboring countries, as well
       as sent appeals to the media like this one.
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       Below are 9 modest ﻿&amp;﻿/or utopic suggestions ﻿&amp;﻿ requests:﻿<br﻿>﻿
       1- This is a long siege please keep the pressure to
       have our story told ﻿&amp;﻿ appeals for action continuous.﻿<br﻿>﻿
       2- The Centre's admin.﻿&amp;﻿ finance director, Ms. Manal
       Issa has collected about 10 testimonies by children
       around her describing conditions under siege as well
       as drawings she has scanned. These testimonies in
       Arabic can be obtained directly from her at:
       ﻿<a﻿ ﻿href="mailto:issamanal@yahoo.com" ﻿="">﻿issamanal@yahoo.com﻿﻿. I will translate them tomorrow to
       englsih ﻿&amp;﻿ have them available. I am also asking that
       anybody who gets this email directly or forwarded, ask
       us for copies of these testimonies to have them
       published as widely as possible.﻿<br﻿>﻿
       3- Please ask for pressure on the international
       community ﻿&amp;﻿ decision makers to lift the siege on us.
       We need tens ﻿&amp;﻿ hundreds of letters daily to:
       ﻿<a﻿ ﻿href="mailto:president@whitehouse.gov" ﻿="">﻿president@whitehouse.gov﻿﻿ ﻿&amp;﻿ ﻿<a﻿ ﻿href="mailto:vice.president@whitehouse.gov" ﻿="">﻿vice.president@whitehouse.gov﻿﻿<br﻿>﻿
       4- If you do not want that, please write mainstream
       news organizations in the US about the siege.﻿<br﻿>﻿
       5- We need daily demonstrations in front of Israeli
       embassies.﻿<br﻿>﻿
       6- We need appeals from Arab artists to western
       European artists for concerts/demonstrations/appeals
       to decision makers to lift the siege.﻿<br﻿>﻿
       7- We need action by Western/European artists for
       events to ask for the siege to be lifted on us.﻿<br﻿>﻿
       8- If you work for a publication, please keep a
       section for daily news or weekly news from the siege,
       interviews with witnesses to repression/the siege,
       children's testimonies, ﻿&amp;﻿ information from hospitals.﻿<br﻿>﻿
       9-The disastrous health picture can be obtained by
       calling the Ramallah Hospital ﻿&amp;﻿ talking to its
       director Dr. Atari or to the Deputy minister of health
       who is stationed there Dr. Munther Sharif (972 2 2 298
       2220).﻿<br﻿>﻿
       10- Please give us your suggestions for action ﻿&amp;﻿ for
       what you need from us to better help us. 
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       Thank you to the Muharraq Club, Bahrein TV, ﻿&amp;﻿ Dubai's
       Nadwat al Thaqafa for hearing us already.. 
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       Thank you all ﻿&amp;﻿ we all look forward to hearing from
       you soon,﻿<br﻿>﻿
       Adila Laidi.
