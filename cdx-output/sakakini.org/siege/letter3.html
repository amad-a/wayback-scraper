      Dear all: 
﻿﻿<p﻿>﻿<div﻿ ﻿align="justify" ﻿="">﻿
       


       I am the director of the Khalil Sakakini Cultural Centre in Ramallah, writing you from home, under siege. This is the
       3rd message i write you to give a sense of what we are living under ﻿&amp;﻿ to hopefully provide material for
       publication/broadcast. 
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       Please find below the chilling testimony in English of the arrest of the father of one of the children whose testimonies
       we sent you a few days ago. It was transcribed in Arabic by Ms. Manal Issa, the Sakakini Center's Administrative ﻿&amp;﻿
       Finance Officer, ﻿&amp;﻿ translated into English. She also has scanned a number of drawings of children under siege. Please
       contact her (issamanal@yahoo.com) for the Arabic version of the testimony ﻿&amp;﻿ copies of the drawings we hope you
       can publish. 
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       Monday April 1st, 2002 : I was arrested yesterday with a number of young men. Our hands were tied ﻿&amp;﻿ we
       were blindfolded. We were taken to an open space where it was very cold and the rain was pouring. We sat on
       the ground hands tied, blindfolded ﻿&amp;﻿ heads bent. We were detained like that for 13 continuous hours in the
       same position. They would beat us brutally, yell at us and urinate on our heads. The blows were coming from
       all sides, on our faces and genitalia. One of us was taken away, we asked about him after a while ﻿&amp;﻿ were told
       he had been taken home. After midnight our heads were covered with bags and we were told to go home. The
       soldiers confiscated our IDs and said they would kill us all, but three by three. They said they had already
       killed a number of us and would finish the rest in the coming days. The man who had been taken away is a 17
       year old neighbor of mine who has a brain tumor. After we returned home, we were told he had spent the
       whole night under torture, as the neighbors had heard his screams and cries for help. In the morning, we
       found his naked dead body in the street mutilated, his head pierced, and his heart riddled with bullets. They
       still have my ID. I know they will come ﻿&amp;﻿ get me. What I fear is not death, but that I will die in cold blood,
       without being able to do anything.﻿<br﻿>﻿
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       Other day to day news to round up the image of what we are living: Ramallah woke up at 4am today with the non
       stop 2 hour long pounding by helicopter ﻿&amp;﻿ tank of the headquarters of the Preventive Security headquarters in the
       adjacent Beitunia Road (off from Ramallah's industrial zone). That complex housing a hotel, a restaurant and day care
       center had 400 people inside it at the time of the bombing. We do not know how many casualties there are since
       ambulances were prevented from entering. 
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       There was more shelling yesterday evening in different parts of the town, including the breaking into, ﻿&amp;﻿ destruction of   part of the Qassaba cinematheque ﻿&amp;﻿ theater in downtown Ramallah. This theater which was home to an
       extraordinary evening last Thursday night of poetry and music and dance with Mahmoud Darwish, Nobel laureates
       Wole Soyinka ﻿&amp;﻿ Jose Saramago ﻿&amp;﻿ other writers on a solidarity mission with Palestine.. More information on this
       destruction can be obtained by calling the theater director, Mr. George Ibrahim, at: 00 972 52 617 819 or 00 970 59
       200 640. 
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       A 2 hour break in the curfew was announced today by the Israelis, this is a bad sign as it means the siege will last a
       long time. People who went out described a scene of desolation: Tanks at every cross roads closing access to major
       roads, trees and electricity poles broken, traffic lights broken, scores of destroyed cars, most roads' asphalt is dug
       out, making the roads unusable. All this destruction in a few hours of the proud achievements of the Ramallah
       municipality in the last 4 years. The municipality itslef having been occupied also on Saturday. During the 2 hour
       break, the call to prayer -Adhan- was heard for the first time in five days from Mosques' minarets..
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       People in downtown Ramallah-ElBireh continue to be suffering the most from lack of electricity and water. My
       brother in-law i wrote you about was into his 5th day without electricity ﻿&amp;﻿ phone. The break allowed him to leave on
       foot ﻿&amp;﻿ walk to my mother in law's home where they will live at 8 to a 3 bedroom apartment for God knows how
       long.. My neighbor's relatives are suffering the same fate, with the added trauma of having a teenage son arrested by
       the Israelis on Friday in their mass arrests ﻿&amp;﻿ with no news of his whereabouts. So far about 700 young Palestinian
       have been arrested in these racist ﻿&amp;﻿ senseless mass arrests in the Ramallah-Bireh metro area alone. 
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       Health wise, garbage goes uncollected. More importantly, tanks fired on the building of the Medical Relief
       Organization where a number of Italian peace activists are barricaded there in solidarity, ﻿&amp;﻿ on the doorstep of which
       the corpse of an executed Palestinian man was thrown yesterday. The 28 bodies of killed Palestinian that had been
       piling up at the Ramallah hospital morgue, were buried today in the hospital's courtyard, as Israelis did not allow the
       bodies to be returned by ambulance to their families ﻿&amp;﻿ receive proper burial for the last 5 days.. More information can
       be obtained from the Ramallah hospital by calling 00 970 or 972 298 22 20. 
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       In my neighborhood, a group of Israeli soldiers went into a number of homes yesterday, ﻿&amp;﻿ searched them room by
       room. In one home, they stole $2500 in cash ﻿&amp;﻿ lacerated with a knife all the living broom's sofas.. 
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       In conclusion, these are the sociocidal facts, ﻿&amp;﻿ small traumas of daily life under siege. As you see, this is a sample of the the daily lot of big and small crimes committed against a small segment of the Palestinian population. A fraction of
       these crimes committed against any other people would have elicited condemnation ﻿&amp;﻿ foreign intervention. But our
       plight is a war of perceptions and images. We are portrayed as fighting the heirs of Anne Franck, while in fact we are
       being turned into the decimated native americans of the digital age. 
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       We are grateful to the generous individuals ﻿&amp;﻿ private and non governmental organizations who are petitioning their
       governments ﻿&amp;﻿ media ﻿&amp;﻿ who get our message out. Please please, try to use these emails in letters to officials in the
       US or to the media for publication, not for us, but in the name of our shared humanity. We thank you ﻿&amp;﻿ hope to hear
       of your efforts, Adila Laidi.
