       Saturday, March 30, 2002 
﻿﻿<p﻿>﻿
       My name is Alayyan Zayed, I am 9 years old. I cannot play in my back yard. I cannot step outside of my
       home’s front door, because of the curfew. I have hidden my toys because I am afraid the Israeli soldiers will
       take me away, for having toy guns and toy tanks. I cannot even walk to the store to buy candy because of the
       curfew. 
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       This is a letter from Rana to the whole world: During this situation, my father is faraway. When I first noticed
       my sister and mother crying while watching TV where the Israeli soldiers are shooting the arrested men. I
       imagined my dad might be one of them. I started crying and crying and after a minute I asked myself why do I
       cry, this is our destiny. My father is a policeman and we should resist.
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       I am Lema Zayed, 11 years old: I want to go to school to finish my study this year. I want to be free during
       the summer, to go swimming and playing. I want the Israeli soldiers to leave our land, stop the occupation,
       and stop using these heavy tanks. We have nothing to confront them by. I do not want them to occupy our
       schools, or shelling them.
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       I am Ahmed Tuqan, 7 years old. Since the Intifada started, we started moving from one home to another.
       Every week we live in a different home. The Israelis enter homes and frighten people. When they enter
       Jerusalem, we move to Ramallah and when they enter Ramallah, we move to Jerusalem.
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       Mustafa Mulhem, 8 years old: I want to thank the foreign countries as they intend to help the Palestinian
       children. We are in a very bad and poor situation. Our towns are occupied. I am in Ramallah, we are under a
       total occupation by the Israeli soldiers, and the city is full of tanks and military vehicles. I feel sorry for the
       shuhada [dead] and wounded, but our hospitals and doctors will protect us.
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       I am Ala’ Jibrin, 12 years old: I live in Ramallah in an old house consisting of one room. It does not include a
       bathroom, so we use with our neighbors an outside toilet [outhouse] which is 30 meters far from our home.
       The Israeli soldiers prevent us from using it, or going to the kitchen, which is also outside our home. We
       cannot even prepare food. We are eight siblings in a very difficult situation. We are confused and do not know
       what to do, if we go out they might shoot us. What’s more, the soldiers throw their rubbish, defecate and pee
       at our front door. The electricity is cut off since yesterday. We are nervous and in a very difficult
       psychological situation. We ask God, and everyone who has human feelings over this earth to interfere and
       put an end to this nightmare prevailing over the lives of the Palestinian children. 
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       I am Yanal Zayed, I am 4 years old: I want to swim. I want a home, a house and a window to look through.
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       I am Sara Atrash, I am 5 years old, I love you Mom.
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       Heba Burkan 12 years: We long for peace and security. We want love and affection. Give us childhood, and
       freedom. 
﻿<p﻿>﻿<b﻿>﻿
       Sunday, March 31, 2002 ﻿﻿
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       Ahmed Atrash, 8 years old: This is a very difficult situation. I am bored. My parents do not allow me to play
       in the back yard. They do not allow me to watch TV, for they are watching the news. I am sad for the shuhada
       [dead] and my sorrow increased when I heard their numbers was increasing. But, I am playing with my
       friends in the neighborhood. My only wish is the Israeli soldiers to get out of my land, and this is the best wish
       I make.
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       Ala’ Jibrin, 12 years old: While we were sleeping, we heard the sound of broken glass. We peeped through
       the window and saw Israeli soldiers breaking car windows and stealing record players. They broke our car
       windows, but thank God, they did not steal our recorder. In the morning, 15 soldiers entered our home
       shouting. They turned over the house upside down, arrested my dad, and kept us in our small kitchen, which is
       located outside the house. I think they took away my dad, because of having a Palestinian flag. We saw them
       beating up the arrested men very hard. Isn’t that terrorism itself, oh my God!
﻿<p﻿>﻿
       Mizer Jibrin, 15 years. (Ala’s brother) The Israeli soldiers prevented us from going out to the kitchen or to
       the bathroom. We were in an unbelievable situation. Since the bathroom was far from our home, my younger
       sisters use an empty garbage can. I refused to, and insisted to go to the bathroom outside. My parents tried to
       prevent me, and due to my insistence they agreed, warning me to take care. When I finished using the
       bathroom, the soldiers were surrounding the place and asked me to raise my hands. One of them pushed me
       and started questioning me: What are you doing, what’s your name, how old are you?. I answered them, and
       they were about to beat me, when my father cried “stop it, stop it, he is a child who went out to use the
       bathroom”. They released me and broke into our home. They imprisoned my sisters, brothers and me in our
       small kitchen and destroyed our belongings. They arrested my father and beat him with the other men. Then
       they covered their heads with plastic bags, taking them to unknown destinations. I experienced the occupation
       and I will never, ever forget. I want to say stop your occupation, stop your tyranny and stop your killing,
       stop…

﻿<p﻿>﻿
       Alayyan Zayed, 9 years old: The Israeli soldiers are killing the young men and frightening the children. They
       are imprisoning the Palestinian soldiers and killing journalists. Support us and protect us.
