<p>
       The President<br>
       The White House<br>
       1600 Pennsylvania Avenue<br>
       Washington, DC, USA. 
</p></b><p><b>
       Mr. President: 
</b></p><p></p><div align="justify">
       I am writing you from the Middle East, from a small
       town called Ramallah (as big as Georgetown in DC where
       I studied and worked for five years), in a country we
       hope will one day be called Palestine. 
<p>
       Since Friday March 29th 2002 (6 days ago today)
       neither I nor my husband have been able to go to work.
       My 3 year old daughter has not gone to her nursery.
       Garbage in my town has gone uncollected. Soldiers
       burst into my neighbor’s home, destroyed the furniture
       and stole 2,500 $ in cash. My brother in law lived for
       5 days without electricity, heating or telephone. One
       of my co workers at the small art center I run has had
       his 20 year old brother arrested by soldiers in the
       middle of the night and taken no one knows where.
       Their home was ransacked in the process. Anyway, his
       brother is in the company of 700 other young men
       arested in this manner in my town alone. Another co
       worker’s husband was also arrested, but he returned to
       tell of his being blindfolded and handcuffed for 13
       hours in the cold and rain, while he was beaten and
       urinated on. By the way, he was arrested for
       preventing soldiers from beating his teenage son who
       had sneaked out of his front door. 
</p><p>
       To go beyond my friends and relatives, I will mention
       the 29 bodies of men killed in cold blood over the
       last 5 days, that piled up in my town’s hospital
       morgue, 2 to a fridge. Since there are more such
       bodies incoming, hospital staff buried them yesterday
       afternoon in the hospital’s courtyard, by bringing a
       tractor that tore the asphalt out, and then covered
       the shallow hole with earth. That was a mass grave for
       people whose relatives did not kiss in their coffins.
       This happened because some of the same soldiers who
       murdered these 29 men earlier, were also blocking all
       exits from that hospital. By the way, the freely
       elected leader of my people has been isolated from the
       outside world and encircled for six days. Finally, in
       another little town called Bethlehem were Jesus Christ
       was born 2002 years ago, tens of civilians, priests,
       and bishops have been encircled for two days in the
       Nativity Church. A few yards away the corpses of two
       people killed by gunfire lie in their home, amidst
       their family which is unable to get them out for
       burial. 
</p><p>
       These are not scenes from a post apocalyptic "Mad Max"
       style movie, but real life, taking place in the third
       month of the third year of the 21st century, in full
       view of CNN and Fox News and ABC and CBS, and NBC,
       etc.. I am writing from Palestine, once the land of
       peace, now the setting to a string of ghettos, its
       inhabitants regularly repressed, killed, exiled and
       imprisoned until they become the new century’s newest
       lost tribe. 
</p><p>
       I am writing you Mr. President, to ask why hundreds of
       countries around the globe, African, Arab, Asian,
       European, Latin American, etc, are all wrong when they
       say we should really get what we want: First lifting
       the siege imposed on our cities that I described
       above, and ultimately lead normal and free lives, in
       dignity, on our land.. I am asking you this question
       as you run Mr. Bush, the only country in the world
       that the soldiers in my neighborhood, and the soldiers
       around my town’s hospital -&amp; those who have been
       sending them here for the last 17 months- will listen
       to. The people of my town and others like it are not
       bombing anyone’s home with supersonic planes, they are
       not laying siege to anyone’s home, and they have not
       driven out a whole civilian population half a century
       ago. Even if after 53 years and 17 months of
       repression, the most desperate among us commit
       suicidal acts of destruction, we all simply want to be
       able to lead normal, simple, peaceful and free lives.
       A life where we can drive for miles on open roads, go
       to a concert in another town, forget about politics,
       have career plans and retirement plans, and celebrate
       joyful independence days. Instead of wondering if my
       daughter will not grow up to say one day: I could have
       been a Palestinian.
