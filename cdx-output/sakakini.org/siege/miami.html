Israeli soldiers blamed for vandalism﻿<br﻿>﻿ 
Palestinian center for arts ransacked ﻿<br﻿>﻿
       BY MARTIN MERZER 
      ﻿<a﻿ ﻿href="mailto: mmerzer@herald.com" ﻿="">﻿ mmerzer@herald.com﻿﻿﻿<p﻿>﻿

      RAMALLAH, West Bank - Israeli soldiers arrived at the Khalil 
       Sakakini Cultural Center at 10:45 a.m. on April 13. They 
       detonated a small charge in the door, ran up the marble steps, 
       detonated another charge in another door and burst into the 
       office. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       They stayed for just a few hours, but they seized a computer 
       and a cellphone, broke dozens of windows, swept books off 
       shelves, peppered walls with shrapnel and bullets, spit 
       pumpkin seeds on the floor and allegedly stole 3,700 shekels, 
       or about $825. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       This was not Yasser Arafat's office or one of his armories or 
       ministries. This was a nonprofit organization that promotes 
       Palestinian art and culture. It is funded by the Ford 
       Foundation, the European Union, Dutch benefactors and others. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       Abstract paintings hang on the walls, though one frame is now 
       punctured by a bullet hole. Sculptures stand on display, 
       though one is now broken in two. The sign outside says: 
       ``Hosni Radwan Exhibition Open Daily from 9 a.m. -- 5 p.m.'' ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       The wrought iron door next to that sign was charred and 
       deformed by the soldiers' explosives. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       ''This was not a security operation,'' Adila Laidi, the 
       center's American-educated director, said Tuesday. ``They 
       didn't come in here looking for terrorists. You don't steal 
       money during a security operation. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       ``It was just vandalism, part of a conscious desire to ruin 
       everything Palestinian. Once you decide to do that, you go and 
       methodically destroy every institution. Subconsciously, they 
       are dreaming about shoving the whole Palestinian people out of 
       existence.'' ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       Many Palestinians charge that Israeli soldiers systematically 
       looted private homes and companies, stealing jewelry, money 
       and other items. Officials of Arafat's Palestinian Authority 
       say nearly every ministry building has been unnecessarily 
       wrecked. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       ''I ask you, how is raiding, ransacking, destroying and 
       looting the ministry of education, health or transportation 
       related to fighting this supposed [terrorist] 
       infrastructure?'' asked Yasser Abed Rabbo, the Palestinian 
       minister of culture and information. ``The Israeli occupation 
       army destroyed the records of one million Palestinian 
       students.'' ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       Israeli officials said their soldiers had to thoroughly search 
       for terrorists, weapons and financial records that might 
       provide military intelligence. They said Israel's army is 
       known for being honorable and moral, and it is clearly against 
       policy for any soldier to steal private property. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

[Image] Still, the army said one soldier already has been arrested on 
       suspicion of theft, 24 other cases are being investigated and 
       officers are spot checking soldiers' personal bags for stolen 
       property. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       ''We condemn all kinds of vandalism and looting,'' said Lt. 
       Col. Olivier Rafovitch, a spokesman for the Israel Defense 
       Forces. ``And if we have evidence against soldiers, we will 
       take the necessary action.'' ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       It is difficult to see any justification or rationale for what 
       happened on April 13 at the elegant stone mansion at 4 Raja 
       Street that houses the Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       The center was founded in 1998 and is located a few blocks 
       from the commercial center of Ramallah, a Palestinian city 
       about as far away from Jerusalem as Hialeah is from downtown 
       Miami. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       The group sponsors about eight monthly concerts, book readings 
       and art exhibits for adults, and it underwrites a Visual Arts 
       Nurture Program for children. It frequently has hosted 
       visiting artists, lecturers and performers from the United 
       States. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       On its second floor is an office reserved for Mahmoud Darwish, 
       the Palestinian poet often called the conscience of his 
       people. Darwish is in the United States, but he uses this 
       office when he is in Ramallah. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       Now, the office is filled with shattered glass, books tossed 
       from shelves and letters and documents stripped from files. A 
       bullet penetrated one window, leaving a neat hole and not a 
       single radiating crack. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       Just outside that office, 15 bullet holes perforate an 
       adjoining wall and ceiling. Laidi said those holes will not be 
       repaired. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       ''They will stay here forever,'' she said, ``because we have 
       to remember, and it has to be a testimony of what Israelis did 
       to an art center.'' ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       No one was in the building when the Israelis arrived, but 
       residents of nearby houses called to tell her what was 
       happening. It will cost about $5,000 to repair the damage, she 
       said, a considerable sum because the annual budget is only 
       $64,000. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       Laidi, 35, was born in Algeria. She was educated at Georgetown 
       University in Washington, D.C. She has a husband and a 
       3-year-old daughter. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       In recent months, the center has organized a ''Break the 
       Siege'' project and a photographic memorial of ''100 Shaheed 
       -- 100 Lives.'' In response to questions, Laidi said Shaheed 
       are not suicide bombers, but rather martyrs, those who have 
       been killed during the Palestinian uprising. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       Still, Laidi said everyone has a right to artistic expression. ﻿<br﻿>﻿

       ''Palestinian art? I guess for Israelis that is considered 
       subversive,'' she said. ﻿<p﻿>﻿

       ``I guess our art is very dangerous, if you don't want us to exist at all.''﻿<p﻿>﻿
