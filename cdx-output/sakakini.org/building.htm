<p><!--The Sakakini is currently undergoing renovation work on
its grounds, under the supervision of <I>Riwaq</I>. Work is due to be completed
in September 1998 on: Installing central heating in the Music Room and
offices, landscaping the garden, converting the garage into a larger space
to be rented out for commercial use - bookstore &amp;&nbsp; gift shop -,
the building of an underground storage space,&nbsp; and the construction
of a new outer wall. These works are made possible through a grant from
the Arab League Education, Science and Culture Organization, administered
by the Palestinian Ministry of Culture.

</a>-16
Klm. north of Jerusalem-, the building housing the KSCC is a model of traditional
Palestinian architecture. Built in 1927 with massive pink stone, floors
tiled with traditional Palestinian tiles, it is surrounded by a large garden
and orchard. It was built for <a href="/sakakini.org/photos/p47.jpg" style="">Khalil Salem Salah</a>
as a family home for an approximate cost of 20,000 Palestinian pounds.
Salah was mayor of Ramallah from 1947 to 1951.</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">In 1995, the house was sold to the Palestinian Ministry
of Culture. Renovated by the architectural conservation firm <i>Riwaq</i>
with the financial support of the Japanese government, it was converted
into a cultural center inaugurated in May 1996. The Centre’s renovation
was part of an ongoing trend of surveying, renovating, and finding new
uses for abandoned or decayed traditional buildings throughout Palestine.</font>
</p><p><font size="+1">The ground floor of the Centre is made up of a reception
area and four rooms used as exhibit space. The first floor houses the Centre’s
administration and the offices of the <i>Al Karmel</i> literary quarterly,
edited by the poet Mahmoud Darwish. The top floor is made up of a large
multipurpose room hosting most of the Centre’s activities.</font><font size="+1"></font>
</p><p><font size="+1">The building underwent a second round of renovation in
the summer and fall of 1998, when <i>Riwaq</i> oversaw the installation
of central heating, landscaped the garden, converted the garage into a
larger space to be used as a bookstore, built additional storage space,
and a new outer wall and gate. The works were made possible through a grant
from the Arab League Education Science and Culture Organization.</font>
