<p><font size="+1">The Khalil Sakakini Cultural Centre was named after a
pioneering Palestinian educator. Until the late 1960’s, thousands of young
Palestinians received their primary education from the school books he
authored. His memory lives on thanks to the innovative Arabic language
and grammar teaching methods he devised, his political and literary writings,
and the breadth of his educational mission. </font></p>
