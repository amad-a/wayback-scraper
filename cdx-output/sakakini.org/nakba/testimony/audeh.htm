<p>I<i>n these extracts from his memoir, Father Audeh Rantisi remembers
the horrific that confronted him, aged 11, when his family were brutally
deported from their home of many generations to make what life could for
themselves in the refugee camps of Ramallah</i> <font size="-1">From "Blessed
are the Peacemakers ...The History of a Palestinian Christian"</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">Father Rantisi was born in Lyda,
now the site of Ben Gurion Airport, in 1937. From 1955 to 1958 he attended
the<img src="/sakakini.org/nakba/testimony/pic1.jpg" height="228" width="150" align="RIGHT"> Bible College
of Wales, moving in 1963 to continue his studies at Aurora College in the
state of Illinois. He then served as a missionary in Sudan. In 1965 he
opened the Evangelical Home for Boys in Ramallah, West Bank. In 1976 Father
Rantisi was elected as Ramallah's deputy mayor and he is now the director
of the orphanage of the Evangelical Home of Boys.</font></font> <br>
<font color="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">I cannot forget three horror-filled
days in July of 1948. The pain sears my memory, and I cannot rid myself
of it no matter how hard I try.</font></font> <br>
<font color="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First,
Israeli soldiers forced thousands of Palestinians from their homes near
the Mediterranean coast, even though some families had lived in the same
houses for centuries. (My family had been in the town of Lydda in Palestine
at least 1,600 years). Then, without water, we stumbled into the hills
and continued for three deadly days. The Jewish soldiers followed, occasionally
shooting over our heads to scare us and keep us moving.</font></font> <font color="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">Terror
filled my eleven-year-old mind as I wondered what would happen. I remembered
overhearing my father and his friends express alarm about recent massacres
by Jewish terrorists. Would they kill us, too?</font></font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
did not know what to do, except to follow Orders and stumble blindly up
the rocky hills. I walked hand in hand with my grandfather, who carried
our only remaining possessions-a small tin of sugar and some milk for my.
aunt's two-year-old son, sick with typhoid.</font></font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
horror began when Zionist soldiers deceived us into leaving our homes,
then would not let us go back, driving us through a small gate just outside
Lydda. I remember the scene well: thousands of frightened people being
herded like cattle through the narrow opening by armed soldiers firing
overhead. In front of me a cart wobbled toward the gate. Alongside, a lady
struggled, carrying her baby, pressed by the crowd. Suddenly, in the jostling
of the throngs, the child fell. The mother shrieked in agony as the cart's
metal-rimmed wheel ran over her baby's neck. That infant's death was the
most awful sight I had ever seen.</font></font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside
the gate the soldiers stopped us and ordered everyone to throw all valuables
onto a blanket. One young man and his wife of six weeks, friends of our
family, stood near me. He refused to give up his money. Almost casually,
the soldier pulled up his rifle and shot the man. He fell, bleeding and
dying while his bride screamed and cried. I felt nauseated and sick, my
whole body numbed by shock waves. That night I cried, too, as I tried to
sleep alongside thousands on the ground. Would I ever see my home again?
Would the soldiers kill my loved ones, too?</font></font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early
the next morning we heard more shots and sprang up. A bullet just missed
me and killed a donkey nearby. Everybody started running as a stampede.
I was terror-stricken when I lost sight of my family, and I frantically
searched all day as the crowd moved along.</font></font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
second night, after the soldiers let us stop, I wandered among the masses
of people, desperately searching and calling. Suddenly in the darkness
I heard my father's voice. I shouted out to him. What joy was in me! I
had thought I would never see him again. As he and my mother held me close,
I knew I could face whatever was necessary. The next day brought more dreadful
experiences. Still branded on my memory is a small child beside the road,
sucking the breast of its dead mother. Along the way I saw many stagger
and fall. Others lay dead or dying in the scorching midsummer heat. Scores
of pregnant women miscarried, and their babies died along the wayside.
The wife of my father's cousin became very thirsty. After a long while
she said she could not continue. Soon she slumped down and was dead. Since
we could not carry her we wrapped her in cloth, and after praying, just
left her beside a tree. I don't know what happened to her body.</font></font>
</p>

<p><font color="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
eventually found a well, but had no way to get water. Some of the men tied
a rope around my father's cousin and lowered him down, then pulled him
out, and gave us water squeezed from his clothing. The few drops helped,
but thirst still tormented me as I marched along in the shadeless, one-hundred
plus degree heat.</font></font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
trudged nearly twenty miles up rocky hills, then down into deep valleys,
then up again, gradually higher and higher. Finally we found a main road,
where some Arabs met us. They took some of us in trucks to Ramallah, ten
miles north of Jerusalem. I lived in a refugee tent camp for the next three
and one-half years. We later learned that two Jewish families had taken
over our family home in Lydda.</font></font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those
wretched days and nights in mid-July of 1948 continue as a lifelong nightmare
because Zionists took away our home of many centuries. For me and a million
other Palestinian Arabs, tragedy had marred our lives forever. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout his life my father
remembered and suffered. For thirty-one years before his death in 1979,
he kept the large metal key to our house in Lydda. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After more than four decades I still
bear the emotional scars of the Zionist invasion. Yet, as an adult, I see
what I did not fully understand then: that the Jews are also human beings,
themselves driven by fear, victims of history's worst outrages, rabidly,
sometimes almost mindlessly searching for security. Lamentably, they have
victimized my people.</font></font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four
years after our flight from Lydda I dedicated my life to the service of
Jesus Christ. Like me and my fellow refugees, Jesus had lived in adverse
circumstances, often with only a stone for a pillow. As with his fellow
Jews two thousand years ago and the Palestinians today, an outside power
controlled his homeland-my homeland. They tortured and killed him in Jerusalem,
only ten miles from Ramallah, and my new home. He was the victim of terrible
indignities. Nevertheless, Jesus prayed on behalf of those who engineered
his death, "Father, forgive them..."</font></font> <br>
<font color="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">Can I do less?</font></font> <br>
