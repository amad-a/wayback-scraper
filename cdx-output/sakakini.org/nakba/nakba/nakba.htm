There is no denying that the Zionist colonization of Palestine,&nbsp;<br>
which began in the early 1880s and continues to this day, represents one
of the&nbsp;<br>
most remarkable colonizing ventures in the twentieth century</font></font>.<font color="#FFFFCC">
</font><font size="-1"><font color="#FFCC99">On 29 November&nbsp;<br>
1947 the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution recommending
the&nbsp;<br>
partition of Palestine into a Jewish state, a Palestinian state, and a
special international&nbsp;<br>
regime (<i>corpus separatum</i>) for Jerusalem and its environs. An economic
union would<br>
be set up between the Jewish and Palestinian states. The Palestinians and
other Arabs&nbsp;<br>
were stunned as the Zionists and their sympathizers were jubilant. The
very reactions&nbsp;<br>
of each side belied the claim that partition was a compromise solution.</font></font>
<br><font size="-1"><font color="#FFD1A4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font color="#FFCC99">
The Palestinian problem was now rapidly approaching its catastrophic climax.</font></font>
<br><font color="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">Some three quarters of a million
Palestinian refugees, over half of them villagers, took up</font></font>
<br><font color="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">the road for exile. While the plight
of these refugees has been the subject of repeated United</font></font>
<br><font color="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">Nations resolutions and numerous
books, far less attention has been paid to the physical</font></font>
<br><font size="-1"><font color="#FFCC99">destruction of the world they inhabited.</font></font>
<br><font size="-1"><font color="#FFCC99">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The member states that championed and endorsed partition did so in full
knowledge of bitter Palestinian and Arab opposition to it. The Palestinians
had lost some four thousand lives fighting partition from 1937 to 1939.
Since its creation, the Arab League had been warning against partition.
The UN partition plan was based on the Zionist plan that American president
Truman had endorsed as early as August 1946. From the Palestinian perspective,
partition was Zionist in provenance and conception, and tailored to meet
Zionist needs and demands.</font>&nbsp;<font color="#FFCC99">&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;</font>
