<p><font size="+1">The main cultural event of the month was the holding of
the Palestinian Writers' Union first international conference, held at
Bir Zeit University from the 22nd to the 25th. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Before the conference began, controversy swirled around
the conference, mainly due to the refusal of Israeli authorities to grant
visas to a number of Arab participants, and the refusal of a number of
Arab writers to come at all, in opposition to the Israeli control of the
borders.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The conference, however, was a success, with the majority
of the rest of the international participants coming. The theme of the
conference was "New Themes for a New Era". topics discussed were:
the role of intellectuals, the new millennium, the political claims of
literature, the west and Islam, culture and the new world order, etc. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Writers in attendance were: Moroccan author Abdellatif
Laabi, Egyptian novelist Lotfi Khouly, the majority of Palestinian poets
and writers, chief among them Mahmoud Darwish, French poet Bernard Noel,
British poets Sarah McGuire and Benjamin Zephaniah, Norwegians Kirsti Bloom,
Knut Odegard, Swedish author Ingrid Ilam, etc.. There were also two poetry
evenings held on the margins of the conference.</font></p>

<p><b><i><font size="+1">Cinema</font></i></b></p>

<p><font size="+1">Director Rachid Machharaoui completed a documentary on
the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, and spent the month in Turkey shooting
his new movie.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The Popular Arts Centre in El Bireh continued its successful
cinema showings, focusing this month on award winning films from around

of lectures all over the country by Palestinian film critic Alia Arsaghli
on the image of women in Arab cinema.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b><i>Theatre</i></b> </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The Jerusalem-based Palestinian National Theatre continued
with its successful multi faceted activities, staging short plays for children,
and previewing the production of two new plays, Al Mukhad (Contractions)
written and directed by Mohammed Zaher, and Al Moukhlissa Lek (Devoted
