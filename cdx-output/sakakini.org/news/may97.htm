troops, religious processions, and handicrafts stands from all the cities
of the West Bank. Because of the continued closure, there were no Gaza
participants. The festivals are dedicated to prophets who have shrines
in those areas. Both festivals were first established by Saladin in post-crusades
time, and were popular yearly celebrations, interrupted by the political
upheavals that have beset Palestine since the 1930s. </font></p>
