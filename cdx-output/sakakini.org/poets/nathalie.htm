<p><b>Ephratha</b></p><p>

There you stand <br>
between the dream of two gazelles,<br>
breathlessly<br>
questioning the poem<br>
Poem <br>
dressed in olive branches and cracked happiness,<br>
surrounded by seasons of sleepless nights staring<br>
at the dusty walls of cities we have lost<br>
Poem<br>
that loses its address or that the address <br>
loses, both, in either case awaiting<br>
the return of those returning not today not ever
</p><p>
Poem <br>
that wishes it could remember if the clouds split in half <br>
the day the soldiers marched in their villages, towns,<br>
houses, dreams and future, remember the crumbling of prayers<br>
remember the gap between hands which held all<br>
that the Poem was too weak to hold, remember when the horses’ <br>
secrets surrendered, when we trespassed ourselves?
</p><p>
Poem<br>
I ask you—why—<br>
does the street have a name I can’t pronounce<br>
does our vocabulary invent us, our accents<br>
resent us—must we come to a halt<br>
and try saying our name without feeling strange<br>
try praising our poets without feeling afraid<br>
Darwish, <br>
every wish can be found in his name
</p><p>
Poem<br>
is exile<br>
a guest made of stones<br>
a thin line between our voice and heaven’s throat?
</p><p>
Poem<br>
are our memories filled with pale notebooks, fading paint, falling walls<br>
to understand this place must we understand its howls, to understand<br>
its howls must we understand its verses, to understand its verses<br>
must we understand agony? 
</p><p>
Poem<br>
the murmur of rivers in your curved chest, the dancing of leaves <br>
in your swaying arms, the sundering roof on your back<br>
the fields of wings in your feet, the dagger and the storm<br>
everywhere inside of you, lead me to my stillness
</p><p>
Poem<br>
when will your words made of earth, your dreams of clouds,<br>
your grotto of milk, your wheat fields, monasteries, synagogues,<br>
crosses and coffins stop stitching miles of bones, stop<br>
broadcasting itself on the radio
</p><p>
Poem<br>
you stand between the dream of two questions<br>
awaiting the day you will unfold yourself<br>
like prayers unfold themselves from our tongues<br>
you continue to stand, I weep and we celebrate<br>
the poem as if it were written <br>
perfectly
</p><p>
Ephratha is Palestine’s Canaanite name, meaning ‘the fruitful.’

<b>
Jenin
</b></p><p>
A night without a blanket, a blanket<br>
belonging to someone else, someone<br>
else living in our homes.<br>
All I want is the quietness of blame to leave,<br>
the words from dying tongues to fall,<br>
all I want is to see a row of olive trees, <br>
a field of tulips, to forget <br>
the maze of intestines, the dried corners <br>
of a soldier’s mouth, all I want is for<br>
the small black eyed child to stop<br>
wondering when the fever will stop<br>
the noise will stop, all I want is<br>
a loaf of bread, some water <br>
and help for the stranger’s torn arm,<br>
all I want is what we have inherited<br>
from the doves, a perfect line of white,<br>
but a question still haunts me at night:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where are the bodies?<br>
</p><p><b>

Bethlehem
</b></p></font><p><font size="-1" font="" color="#655658">
Secrets live in the space between our footsteps.<br>
The words of my grandfather echoed in my dreams,<br>
as the years kept his beads and town.<br>
I saw Bethlehem, all in dust, an empty town<br>
with a torn piece of newspaper lost in its narrow streets.<br>
Where could everyone be? Graffiti and stones answered.<br>
And where was the real Bethlehem--the one my grandfather came from?<br>
Handkerchiefs dried the pain from my hands. Olive trees and tears continued to remember.<br>
I walked the town until I reached an old Arab man dressed in a white robe. <br>
I stopped him and asked, "Aren't you the man I saw in my grandfather's stories?"<br>
He looked at me and left. I followed him--asked him why he left? <br>He continued walking. I stopped, turned around and realized <br>
he had left me the secrets in the space between his footsteps.
