        <b>A Mirror<br>
        </b>Two faces loom in the catastrophe - 
    <dt>my father and his horse ; a little moon </dt>
    <dt>that we will capture sails above our house. </dt>
    <dt>If only we could regain our childhood , </dt>
    <dt>we'd imprison that moon a while between our hands </dt>
    <dt>and when our hearts opined , let it fly away .<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        </dt>
    <dt><b>An Incident<br>
        </b>I saw a hand waving from the river , </dt>
    <dt>it quivered before it disappeared , </dt>
    <dt>wiped off something - a luminous trace of air, </dt>
    <dt>scent of carnation . </dt>
    <dt>The fingers continued to play , wavered , </dt>
    <dt>drew desperate words on the surface , </dt>
    <dt>grew tired , and went under . </dt>
    <dt>How we rejoice alone, </dt>
    <dt>while beneath the water , </dt>
    <dt>there are sunken forests of desires- </dt>
    <dt>the province of the losers . </dt>
