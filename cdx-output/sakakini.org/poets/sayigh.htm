<i><b>DEPARTURE<br>
</b></i>
</p><p>
In this moment of departure,
</p><p>
point your red arrows,
</p><p>
disarm the lightning, and open wide
</p><p>
the gate to my exile.
</p><p>
Close the sky's open face, and ride away.
</p><p>
I long so deeply that the shores unfold their seas
</p><p>
and horses bolt!
</p><p>
Now I'll carry the roads and palm trees in my suitcase,
</p><p>
I'll lock my tears in the evening's copybooks
</p><p>
and seal the seasons.<br>
</p><p>
Let's begin our song: here is Beirut <i>wearing</i> you
</p><p>
 like her own clothes.
</p><p>
You must sit well on the surface of her glory
</p><p>
abandoning tears
</p><p>
In her blue froth
</p><p>
She contains you like eternity
</p><p>
like the sense of beginning that comes with certainty<br>
</p><p>
-How can you be dead, yet so absolutely present ?<br>
</p><p>
Let the rivers abandon their skies, 
</p><p>
and the seas dry out !
</p><p>
Everything in the universe has an end
</p><p>
except my split blood...<br>
</p><p>
Each time I think of it
</p><p>
You remain as large as your death.
</p><p>
The war planes choose you, discover you, plant
</p><p>
their blackness in you.
</p><p>
From all those clouded last visions,
</p><p>
how will you begin the story of harvest?
</p><p>
We planes select you,
</p><p>
at the start of your sleep,
</p><p>
at the end of your sleep.
</p><p>
How often did the sky explode over you
</p><p>
 with hatred?
</p><p>
How often were you taken aside?
</p><p>
How many massacres did you survive ?
</p><p>
Now you collect all the wounds, taking refuge with
</p><p>
 death,
</p><p>
wearing dreams as wings.
