    <dt><b>Bats<br>
        </b>Bats on my windows </dt>
    <dt>suck in my words </dt>
    <dt>Bats at the entrance to my house </dt>
    <dt>behind newspaper , in corners </dt>
    <dt>trail my footsteps , </dt>
    <dt>observing every movement of my head<br>
        </dt>
    <dt>From the back of the chair, bats watch me </dt>
    <dt>They trail me in the streets </dt>
    <dt>watching my eyes pause </dt>
    <dt>on books, on young girls' legs . . . </dt>
    <dt>they watch and watch<br>
        </dt>
    <dt>On my neighbor's balcony , bats, </dt>
    <dt>and electronic gadgets hidden in the walls </dt>
    <dt>Now bats are on the verge </dt>
    <dt>of suicide <br>
        </dt>
    <dt>I am digging a road to daylight<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        </dt>
    <dt><b>Ashes<br>
        </b>Don't you feel we have lost so much </dt>
    <dt>that our " great " love is now only words , </dt>
    <dt>that there's no more yearning , no urgency, </dt>
    <dt>no real joy in our hearts, and when we meet </dt>
    <dt>no wonder in our eyes? </dt>
    <dt>Don't you feel our encounters are frozen , </dt>
    <dt>our kisses cold, </dt>
    <dt>that we've lost the fervor of contact </dt>
    <dt>and now merely exchange polite talk ? </dt>
    <dt>Or we forget to meet at all </dt>
    <dt>and tell false excuses . . . </dt>
    <dt>Don't you feel that our brief hurried letters </dt>
    <dt>lack feeling and spirit, </dt>
    <dt>contain no whispers or dreams of love , </dt>
    <dt>that our responses are slow and burdened . . . </dt>
    <dt>Don't you feel a world has tumbled down </dt>
    <dt>and another arisen ? </dt>
    <dt>That our end will be bitter and frightening </dt>
    <dt>because the end not fall on us suddenly </dt>
    <dt>but came from within<br>
        </dt>
