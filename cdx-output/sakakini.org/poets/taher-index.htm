<p><font size="+1">Riyad was born in 1956 in Amman and was unable to finish
his University education because of financial difficulties. He has translated
works by Eliot, Becket, Dylan Thomas and others into Arabic. He is co-director
of a publishing house in Jordan, and has published a number of poetry collections.
His works are considered to be among the most original of the young generation,
combing the eloquence of classical poetry and the innovation of modernist
Arabic poetry.&nbsp;</font></p>
