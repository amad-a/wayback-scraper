<p><font size="+1">Barghouti is one of the most famous Palestinian poets.
He was born in 1944, and lived most of his life in the Diaspora, he now
lives in Cairo. His works started as patriotic poems, and evolved into
a modernist sensibility and produced some of the most compelling poetic
experiments among Arab poets of his generation. He has several collections
of poetry. He was awarded Cairo's American University 1997  Mahfouz Najib Literature
Prize.</font><br>
