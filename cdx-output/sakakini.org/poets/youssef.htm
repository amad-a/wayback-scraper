        <b>The House<br>
        </b>When I met her by chance 
    <dt>she was a woman whose lips and braids </dt>
    <dt>radiated. </dt>
    <dt>She plucked a flower from my ribs </dt>
    <dt>and flew to the fountainhead </dt>
    <dt>where she built her house from its shining silk.<br>
        </dt>
    <dt>When I kissed her, </dt>
    <dt>she ran like a gazelle </dt>
    <dt>shimmering across God's open country.<br>
        </dt>
    <dt>I said, " Who are you, mare of the water?" </dt>
    <dt>and she said. "I am queen". </dt>
    <dt>When I embraced her </dt>
    <dt>she engulfed me with her waves </dt>
    <dt>and lit my spirit's stars. </dt>
    <dt>I said, "Who are you, velvet flower?" </dt>
    <dt>She said, "I am the down of the nightingale, </dt>
    <dt>the milk of kisses." </dt>
    <dt>When I gave her my sweetest embrace </dt>
    <dt>and performed my ritual prayer, </dt>
    <dt>she stormed through me, through every cell and vein </dt>
    <dt>and erected on my dead body </dt>
    <dt>a house for life. </dt>
