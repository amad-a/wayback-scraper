    </b>Out of what lair did the earthly tyrants escape? </dt>

<dl>
    <dt>Nero burned Rome twice, then composed a discordant tune </dt>
    <dt>he went on playing till the city sang with him. </dt>
    <dt>Holako who inherited that melody </dt>
    <dt>set fire </dt>
    <dt>to the world's library, the river ran </dt>
    <dt>with ink, and from the ashes was born </dt>
    <dt>the language of the locusts which rose </dt>
    <dt>to thank the madman. </dt>
    <dt>After the salutations to madness, Hitler came </dt>
    <dt>(..) but unable to be appeased, </dt>
    <dt>had to include the sea </dt>
    <dt>in his vital destruction, </dt>
    <dt>and war at sea, turmoil on land, </dt>
    <dt>combined in their angry conflagration.<br>
        </dt>
    <dt>I too have seen a tyrant- </dt>
    <dt>whose power diminished the other three. </dt>
    <dt>he has committed every atrocity, </dt>
    <dt>and yet: in his day, </dt>
    <dt>there were five poets, </dt>
    <dt>who took to silence.<br>
        </dt>
