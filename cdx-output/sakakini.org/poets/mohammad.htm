    <dt><b>Vision<br>
        </b>I see the faces change their complexion </dt>
    <dt>peel off their outer skin </dt>
    <dt>I see faces divested </dt>
    <dt>of makeup and masks </dt>
    <dt>and I see an empty stage </dt>
    <dt>the spectators danying their own images </dt>
    <dt>in the third act. </dt>
    <dt>I see a poor man rise </dt>
    <dt>and dream of recreating order. </dt>
    <dt>He doesn't frequent the idlers' cafes </dt>
    <dt>The papers don't carry his picture, </dt>
    <dt>news agencies don't relay his words. </dt>
    <dt>He carves the image of his absent love </dt>
    <dt>on the ceiling of a mountain cave </dt>
    <dt>and sings. </dt>
