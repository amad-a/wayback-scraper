    <dt><b>Martyr<br>
        </b>they found him </dt>
    <dt>luminous, green, in the field. </dt>
    <dt>When they raise his hands </dt>
    <dt>the grasses under them had turned to hearts.<br>
        </dt>
    <dt>It is said: </dt>
    <dt>wheatstalks bloomed beneath his sleeves. </dt>
    <dt>It is said: </dt>
    <dt>the birds carried his blood </dt>
    <dt>to his beloved cousins. </dt>
    <dt>He shall return </dt>
    <dt>Blossoming with volcanoes, </dt>
    <dt>and fill again his mother's breasts. </dt>
    <dt>When they found him green as light </dt>
    <dt>they shrouded him with rose buds, </dt>
    <dt>they spread out the sky to lay him on </dt>
    <dt>and made the sun his pillow.</dt>
