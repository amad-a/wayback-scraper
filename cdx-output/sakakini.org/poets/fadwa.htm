    <dt><b>Enough for Me<br>
        </b>Enough for me to die on her earth </dt>
    <dt>be buried in her </dt>
    <dt>to melt and vanish into her soil </dt>
    <dt>then sprout forth as a flower </dt>
    <dt>played with by a child from my country. </dt>
    <dt>Enough for me to remain </dt>
    <dt>in my country's embrace </dt>
    <dt>to be in her close as a handful of dust </dt>
    <dt>a sprig of grass </dt>

    <dt><b>The Deluge and the Tree<br>
        </b>When the hurricane swirled and spread its deluge </dt>
    <dt>of dark evil </dt>
    <dt>onto the good green land </dt>
    <dt>'they' gloated. The western skies </dt>
    <dt>reverberated with joyous accounts: </dt>
    <dt>"The Tree has fallen ! </dt>
    <dt>The great trunk is smashed! The hurricane leaves no life
        in the Tree!"<br>
        </dt>
    <dt>Had the Tree really fallen? </dt>
    <dt>Never! Not with our red streams flowing forever, </dt>
    <dt>not while the wine of our thorn limbs </dt>
    <dt>fed the thirsty roots, </dt>
    <dt>Arab roots alive </dt>
    <dt>tunneling deep, deep, into the land!<br>
        </dt>
    <dt>When the Tree rises up, the branches </dt>
    <dt>shall flourish green and fresh in the sun </dt>
    <dt>the laughter of the Tree shall leaf </dt>
    <dt>beneath the sun </dt>
    <dt>and birds shall return </dt>
    <dt>Undoubtedly, the birds shall return. </dt>
    <dt>The birds shall return. </dt>
