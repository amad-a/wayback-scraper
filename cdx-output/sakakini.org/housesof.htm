<td valign="top"><font size="3"></font><div align="justify"><font size="3">The KSCC resumed its program of exhibits
with the opening of the Houses of Bethlehem show on February 17 in cooperation
with the newly opened French Cultural Center of Ramallah. This show features
photographs, drawings and architectural croquis of old Bethlehem houses.
The show has toured in Gaza, Jerusalem and Hebron, will tour other Palestinian
cities, and will end in Paris in June, where the exhibit will coincide
with the Palestinian Spring cultural activities due to begin all over France
in March 1997. <br>
<br>
The show aims to showcase local architecture by outlining the intrinsic
characteristics of Palestinians vernacular architecture. The show was the
fruit of the labor of a team of Palestinian and French architects from
a number of Palestinian and French architecture schools, led by Serge Santelli
of Paris-Belleville Architecture school, Catherine Weill-Rochant of Jerusalem,
Elias Deick of Bethlehem University, and Shadi Ghadbane of Bir Zeit University.
