This is the second exhibit of Khaled Hourani at the Sakakini. It is also made up of collages, but exhibiting a greater maturity and versatility. The show featured large works as well as 20x20cm miniatures. The works are dominated by large brushstrokes. Adding to the evocative mood of the works, many of the collages used pages from a book of correspondence between 1930s Lebanese authors Khalil Jubran and May Ziadé, as well as from books on philosophy and art criticism. More information on Hourani is available in his entry in the visual artists' section.
