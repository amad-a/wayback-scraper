</b></p><p><b>A Personal Portrait of an Uprising

</b></p><p><b>By DAVAN MAHARAJ, Times Staff Writer</b>

</p><p>RAMALLAH, West Bank--Some visitors to the Khalil
Sakakini Cultural Center here come to see the tan
hiking boots once worn by Mohammed Durra, the slain
12-year-old whose picture--showing him cowering beside
his father--has become one of the most incendiary
images of the 5 1/2-month-old intifada.

</p><p>Others admire the roughly carved slingshot that
15-year-old Fares Odeh used to fling stones at Israeli
tanks--until he took a fatal bullet in the neck.
Or the unfinished piece of embroidery that Rahma
Hindi, 54, was working on before she was killed by an
Israeli missile.

</p><p>The footwear, slingshot and stitchery are part of
an unusual exhibit of photographs and treasured items
belonging to the first 100 people killed by Israelis
in the ongoing Palestinian uprising against rule by
the Jewish state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The idea for the memorial exhibit was hatched in
October when Palestinians were being killed in clashes
almost every day, their identities unknown to the vast
majority of their compatriots. Since the uprising
broke out at the end of September, about 425 people
have been killed, 80% of them Palestinians.


</p><p>Organizers say the exhibit, funded by the Ford
Foundation, is intended to help visitors see the dead
as individuals, not mere statistics.
"We want people to get to know them, and we want
to give them back their individuality," said Adila
Laidi, director of the cultural center. "These people
sacrificed their lives for independence. Why should
they remain anonymous?"


</p><p>Many Palestinians are paying attention. The
exhibit, which opened in Ramallah in mid-February and
was expected to run for only two weeks, is now in its
fourth week thanks to hundreds of visitors. Organizers
plan to take their show to six cities in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, then on to Jordan, Egypt and Europe.
Some Israeli critics say the exhibit is part of
an effort to manipulate the memory of the dead and
portray Israelis to the Western world as
child-killers.


</p><p>Laidi defended the show, saying: "When many of
these people died, their mothers, friends and
relatives did not have a chance to grieve. This gives
them an opportunity for closure."

</p><p>The exhibition hall at the Sakakini center
usually hosts concerts, displays of elegant paintings
and Palestinian folk art. The noted Palestinian poet
Mahmoud Darwish maintains an office on the second
floor.

</p><p>But the center has been converted into a shrine
for this exhibit. Tea candles flicker on the bare
stone floor. Black-and-white photographs of the dead
are mounted on the wall. Under each photo is a
translucent plastic box containing a belonging or two,
each wrapped with twine like a present.

</p><p>A GameBoy. A soccer ball. Tools. A perfume
bottle. An empty bird cage. Crayon drawings of a boy
flying a kite.

</p><p>Descriptions of the dead are contained in a
208-page catalog that Laidi and the staff of her
nonprofit organization compiled. The stories, Laidi
said, bear witness to the Palestinian condition. Many
lived in cramped and miserable refugee camps. Some
were so poor that they hadn't had their pictures taken
in years, forcing the exhibit's curators to use
whatever pictures their families could muster.

</p><p>Many died in clashes with soldiers. But there are
many exceptions. There's Harald Fischer, a German-born
chiropractor who was killed by an Israeli missile as
he tried to help neighbors. And Bassam Bilbeissi, an
ambulance driver who was slain as he tried to rescue
Durra. Bilbeissi's paramedic uniform is part of the
exhibit.

</p><p>Chadi Barghouti, a Sakakini employee who gathered
items for the exhibit, said he left with stories even
more precious.

</p><p>On the day that 15-year-old Nizar Eideh of
Ramallah died in clashes with soldiers, he released a
bird he had bought three days earlier. Barghouti said
the boy explained to his mother that he didn't want
the bird's mother to miss him.
