<b>Rahma Hindi</b></font><p><font size="-1" color="#6D300A">


54 years old. A widow, Rahma leaves behind two daughters and two sons.  
All of Rahma's children are married save for one of her sons, a teacher, who lived with her.  Rahma was a member of a Women's Cooperative Volunteer Work Committee in Beit Sahour, and worked on embroidery.  On the morning of October 9th, she was in the same taxi as her friend, Aziza Dannoun, when it stalled. Like Aziza, she had been on her way to visit friends and relatives whose homes had been shelled. While waiting with her friend for another taxi to come along, an Israeli helicopter suddenly appeared on the horizon and fired a missile at Fatah Leader Hussein Abiyyat's car to assassinate him. Abiyyat was killed, as were Rahma and Aziza.
