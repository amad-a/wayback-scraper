<b>Zuheir Darabiyeh</b></font><p><font size="-1" color="#6D300A">
25 years old. Originally from Sumsum Village, demolished during the Nakba, Zuheir lived in Jabalia Camp, where he worked as a plumber.  He'd lost his mother, and would always carry a picture of her, tucked in his pocket. On October 7th, he visited her grave with yesterday's paper that showed a picture of him throwing stones.  He was killed near Netzarim.  As punishment, Israeli authorities prevented his brother from entering the Industrial Zone where he worked, by withdrawing his work permit.
