<br><b>1979: "A Compass for the Sunflower" :<img src="/sakakini.org/novelists/arabic1.gif"></b>
<br>
 This first novel was published by Dar Ibn Ruchd in Beirut, to wide acclaim. Its lyrical style broke away from the mold of the Palestinian realist novel, and its focus on a woman’s life from Palestine, to exile in Amman and Beirut, against the backdrop of turbulent political events and catastrophes, challenged the linear, male dominated literary output of the time. 
<br>
It was translated in 1989 by the Women’s Press in the UK, and in 1992 into French by Metropolis in Geneva

<br>

This collection of three novellas was published in Damascus by Dar el Alam and in 1990 by Dar el Thaqafa el Jadida in Cairo, and Dar el Nawrass in Jerusalem. 
<br>
It interweaves the narratives of two women and one man recounting their successive uprootings: 1948 from Palestine, 1970 from Jordan, and 1982 from Beirut. The novellas evocative and contrapuntal style allows the reader to glimpse the joy and despair of lives rooted in exile and resistance. It was translated in 1993 into English by Interlink, NY.
