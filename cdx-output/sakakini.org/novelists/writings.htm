<p><font size="+1">Sahar Khalifeh began writing shortly after the 1967 Israeli
invasion of Gaza and the West Bank, and published her first novel in 1974.
She is considered the foremost Palestinian novelist, widely acclaimed for
being the first feminist Palestinian writer, and for her "sensitive,
economical and lucid" style. She is the most translated Palestinian
author after Mahmoud Darwish. Her fame extends beyond Palestinian and Arab
borders, as her translations in many languages attest: She was the only
author participating in the French organized Palestinian cultural spring
in 1997, whose books sold out immediately. </font></p>
