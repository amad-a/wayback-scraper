Writings
</b><br>
Shammas’ first novel, Arabesques, was written in Hebrew and published in 1986 in Israel to wide acclaim. The book’s themes and rich and multilayered Hebrew raised questions about Israelis’ exclusive ownership of the language, and was hailed as "a turning point in Israel’s cultural life". Among his awards and honors: the 1991-92 Whiting Award, and the 1993 Lila Wallace-Reader’s Digest Writer’s Award.

<b>1997: (Wash your face, O Moon)</b><img src="/sakakini.org/novelists/sarabic3.gif">
</p><p>
A play in Arabic produced by the Arab Theatre in Israel. It tells the story of two Palestinian-Israeli burglars who break into an Arab apartment in a Jewish neighborhood in Haifa, in the year 2012. They soon discover that they are locked in, and they are later joined by an old, hunted Palestinian. The play addresses the question of blurring and loss of identity of Palestinian-Israelis.

He has also written essays, Op-Ed pieces and book reviews for the New York Times, The NYT Book Review, Harper’s Magazine, the LA Times, etc.. Many of which were subsequently translated by a number of European journals and reviews.
