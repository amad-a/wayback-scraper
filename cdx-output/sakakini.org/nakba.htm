<h1 align="CENTER">50 YEARS OF NAKBA IN PALESTINE</h1>

<center><p><img src="/sakakini.org/nakba.jpg" height="210" width="480"><br>
"<font size="-1"><i>Before Their Diaspora</i>", A typical Palestinian
refugee camp at Nahr Al Barid in Lebanon, 1948</font></p></center>

<p><font size="+1">1997 marks the 30th anniversary of the occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza by Israel, and 1998 will mark the 50th anniversary of
the Nakba (catastrophe). In human terms, that year saw the mass deportation
of a million Palestinians from their cities and villages, massacres of
civilians, the razing to the ground of hundreds of Palestinian villages
in present day Israel, etc. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Due to the capital importance of the 1948 &amp; 1967 events
on Palestinian history, present, lives, land, identity, culture and future,
the KSCC will devote the majority of its fall 97 and 1998 programs to their
commemoration. The goal is to induce a national exercise of remembrance,
and reflection on the future. Specifically, the following events will be
organized:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">1- Lecture series by prominent Palestinian (&amp; Palestinian-Israeli)
intellectuals on the influence of the 1948/67 events on their lives &amp;
work, &amp; on Palestinian identity &amp; culture. The lectures will be
later collected in book.(start: 13/11/97)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">2- Testimonies by survivors, 50 years to the day of the
events they witnessed. They will speak in "town meetings" formats,
&amp; each testimony will be recorded to create a sampling visual/oral
history archive of the Nakba.(start: 2/98)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">3- Projection of films, organization of theatre plays,
art and photo exhibits on the Nakba &amp; its representations in documentary
&amp; artistic form.(start: 8/11/97)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">5- Creation of a website on the Nakba.(start: 1/1/98)</font></p>
