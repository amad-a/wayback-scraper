<p><font size="3"></font></p><div align="justify"><font size="3"><a href="/sakakini.org/artists/p13.htm" style="">Nabil Anani</a> is one of the most popular
Palestinian artists working today, he has pioneered the use of local media:
leather, natural dyes, papier-mache, and straw during the Intifada years.
He held his seventh exhibit at the Sakakini in December 1996. He was awarded
in 1997 the first Palestine Prize for Visual Arts.</font>

Halhoul, and graduated in photography from the Fine Arts College of Alexandria
in 1969. Anani is a multi-talented artist, for he is a painter and a ceramist,
a sculptor as well as an art teacher. Anani's first exhibit was in 1972,
and he has participated in about 20 group exhibitions in Palestine, various
Israeli cities, Amman, Cairo, Assilah, Naples, London, Moscow, Paris, Tokyo,
New York, Washington, Bonn, Madrid, etc.. In addition, he has authored
a number of art books and was a founding member of the "New Visions" artists

<p><font size="4">He privileges the medium in his approach to
work. :&quot; In general, what represents for me the strongest
stimulus, is the medium with which I work, added to it, a mix of
sensations that come form ancient memory, mixed with the present
and the past... How does it begin ?, a handful of henna thrown on
a humid leather hide?, a horizontal line snaking its way onto an
unusual surface ?, the dialogue continues until I am convinced
that this work is part of my personal plastic vision&quot;. </font><br>
