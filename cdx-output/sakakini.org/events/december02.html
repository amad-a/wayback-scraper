</p><p><b>
** FILM SCREENING: “Deluge” BY DIR. LINA BUKHARI <br>
** SATURDAY 14/12 @ 7:00 PM </b><br>
“Deluge” was produced  during Ramallah’s March-April invasion, &amp; the subsequent continuous curfews imposed on the West
Bank.  The film takes a metaphysical form, dealing with current realities, &amp; the unfulfilled dreams of Palestinians. The film's
character presents different human states, &amp; questions dreams, memory, &amp; the complex relationship with home “the place”.   A
discussion will follow the screening, with the film's director. 
(Dir. Lina Bukhari, experimental film, 15 minutes, Arabic Language-Palestinian Dialect/English Subtitles, 2002) 
</p><p><b>  

** FILM SCREENING: “Sir Alfred of Charles de Gaulle Airport” <br>
** WEDNESDAY 18/12 @ 6:00 PM </b><br>
Mehran Karemi Nasseri, who now goes by the name “Sir Alfred”, has been living in the Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris,
France. For the past 12 years he has been waiting for the document that would allow him to leave. Unlike the story that has
been told in the world press of a man trapped in the underground terminals of an airport, dubbed the, “strangest case in
immigration history”, this documentary examines the life of a man whose only aspiration is to be somebody else. Screened in
co-operation with the Palestine International Video Festival, curated by Emily Jacir. 
(Dirs. Hamid Rahmanian &amp; Melissa Hibbard, documentary, 29 min., English Lang., 2001)
