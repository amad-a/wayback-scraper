<b>
Greetings
</b></p><p>
We are trying to return to "normal" after a 2 month interruption. This occupation has rid everyone of their right to a
normal life, but we have no other choice but to resist, each in his/her own way. This program is adapted to our erratic
living conditions: Performance times are earlier, &amp; it features 4 activities due to highlight a 3-month long program
devoted to amateur artists from the West Bank: Our annual summer nights festival which was cancelled. We are
showcasing instead young amateurs from the Ramallah area. Similarly, a major commemoration program of Ghassan
&amp; Lamis Kanafani's killing 30 years ago was cancelled, &amp; we will screen instead a film based on his most famous work.
Attached is the Arabic text of the program. </p><p>
  

<b>** MONDAY 5/8 @ 4:00 PM: PHOTO EXHIBIT: “SEARCH” by STEVE SABELLA </b><br>
This is the first exhibit in Ramallah by this young professionally trained photographer who will show exceptionally
beautiful original prints,  showcasing the eerie beauty of Palestinian landscape, like you have never seen it before. 19
of the works are infrared black &amp; white photographs.<br> 
<b>@ 4:45 FILM SCREENING: "The Lost Home" </b><br>
The film narrates the story of Wafa’, the young director, a third generation Nakba survivor. Wafa’ experienced feelings
of loss &amp; alienation after the death of her father &amp; the illness of her mother. She decides to search for her family's house
in Acre, &amp; her camera accompanies her on this journey portraying how this house stands for her attachment to her
roots, her family and land. <br>
(Dir. Wafa' Jamil, 19 min., Arabic Lang./English Subtitle, 2002) <br>
  </p><p>

<b>** THURSDAY 8/8 @ 4:00 PM : CONCERT: "From you the Sword and from us our Blood”:  BASSEL ZAYED </b>
“I will Sing for Hope,  because that is all we need in these times in order to help us find a wedding alongside every
funeral, a groom alongside every Shaheed &amp; joy alongside all our sadness.” Bassel Zayed will sing &amp; play on the Oud
songs by  Sheikh Imam, Samih Shqeir, Marcel Khalifeh, Rahbani Brothers &amp; Sabreen. 
  
</p><p>
<b>** SATURDAY 10/8 @ 3:00 PM: FILM SCREENING: "Al-Makhduun" </b>
This stark black &amp; white classic film traces the destinies of 3 Palestinian men brought together by dispossession,
despair and hope for a better future. The setting is Iraq in the 1950s as the men hide in the steel tank of a truck, trying to
sneak across the desert into Kuwait, the "promised land." A masterful adaptation of Ghassan Kanafani's acclaimed
novel “Men Under The Sun”, this is also one of  the first Arab films to address the Palestinian predicament. 
Directed by Tawfik Saleh, 1972, Arabic Lang., 107 min. (Syria) 
  </p><p>

<b>** WEDNESDAY 14/8 @ 3:30 PM: ART EXHIBIT: "Memorial of artist Taysir Sharaf" </b><br>
On the first year anniversary of the artist's passing, we will show a collection of art works produced by Taysir Sharaf
shortly before his death. The works consist of water-colours &amp; gouache on paper. A slide show will follow the opening,
as well as a lecture by painter &amp; Taysir Sharaf friend Nabil Anani. 
  </p><p>

<b>** THURSDAY 15/8 @ 2:00- 4:00 PM: CHILDREN'S ACTIVITY: "Let Us Draw!!" </b><br>

will also be music and singing. Activity sponsored by the young Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashed Bin Khalifa Al
Maktoom, from Dubai, UAE.

<b>** THURSDAY 22/8 @ 4:00 PM: CHILDREN's ACTIVITY: "Come See the Children Dance": <br></b>
