December, 1997:    
</b></p><p>


</p><p>
The Sakakini hosted the following events: 
</p><p>
* Visiting American violist, Peter Sulski, gave a concert with Palestinian pianist Lara Harb, with a program of Bach and Brahms. In addition, he participated in a recital with professors of the National Conservatory of Music (Suheil Khoury, Nadia Abboushi, Khaled Jubran, etc..) &amp; some of its best students (Harb, Ramzi Hussein, etc..) in a mixed concert of Western (Grieg, Bach, etc..) &amp; Arabic classical music. 
</p><p>
* As part of the Centre’s activities marking the 50th anniversary of the Nakba, two lectures/debates were held at the Centre, with writer/journalist/translator Hassan Khader, and sociologist, Dr. Salim Tamari. 
</p><p>
Khader is an expert on Israeli literature, and this year’s first Palestine Awards winner for journalism. He analyzed treatments of the 1947-49 events in the Palestinian &amp; Israeli narratives (literature &amp; historiography). Tamari is a writer &amp; sociologist, he spoke about the "Electronic Return to Jaffa", analyzing Diaspora Palestinians relationship with the homeland, the Nakba, &amp; with Palestinians who have remained in Palestine. 
</p><p>
In this regard, the Centre also organized a lecture by Dr. Kamal Abd el Fattah, head of Birzeit University’s History Department on the Palestinian villages destroyed by Israel in 1947-49 &amp; in 1967. The lecture was co-sponsored by Riwaq, the Centre for Architectural Conservation. 
</p><p>
Finally, the Centre hosted a lecture /discussion about Rawan &amp; Dima Damen’s oral history book " Migration in the Memory of Palestinian Children", published this year by the Palestinian UNESCO committee. The book is a series of interviews with survivors of the Nakba, regarding their experiences, &amp; the impact it had on their lives. 
</p><p>
* Two documentary films about dancers/choreographers Pina Bausch, Reinhilde Hoffman and Susanne Linke were screened at the Centre
