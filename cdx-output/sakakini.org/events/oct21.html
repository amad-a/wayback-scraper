          will be published later this year, it constitutes -according to the 
          poet- romantic scenes in surrealist visions, an attempt to understand 
          oneself. Yousif is a member of the Palestinian Writers Society, a journalist 
          and editor at Al-Ayyam newspaper, and the cultural correspondent for 
          “Al-Wasat” magazine. (Arabic)</font>

          (WHEN SALT BLOOMS) BY ROSS GEORGESON<br>
          **TUESDAY 16/10 @ 6:30</b><br>
          Ross Georgeson is a British artist who resides in Gaza. The title of 
          the exhibit refers to a particularly bleak period within the last 9 
          months, just one of many phrases concerning something that will never 
          happen. For the artist, when salt blooms is the strongest and most magical, 
          and although unlikely, the one thing that has always happened in Palestine 
          has been the unexpected. The exhibit consists of prints he made in Malaysia 
          and Gaza.</font>

          This month, the book club will host Ahmad Awad for a book signing &amp; 
          discussion of his fifth and latest novel “Qurmuti”. The novel tries 
          to shed light on the political, social, cultural and religious reasons 
          for the fall of a leader and the loss of power and authority. As an 
          illustration of that, the book centers on the theft of the Black Stone 
          from Mecca by Qurmuti in A.D. 920.</font>
