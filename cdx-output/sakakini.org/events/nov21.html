          Kifah's first collection "Nosoos min tareeq al'awd" is a detail 
          of a return journey from places in constant flux, rituals to deconstruct

          ** SATURDAY 24/11 @ 7:00 PM</b><br>
          The film "Atfal wa lakin" was made in Lebanon, it takes the 
          story of a group of Palestinian kids who live in an orphanage, the film 
          shows a realistic picture of the kids, what they think, how they play, 
          and what they draw. The film was produced in 1982, but still it presents 
          a realistic &amp; sad picture of the situation at that moment in time, 
          part of the history that we do not want to forget&amp; is still relevant 
          in 2001…<br>
          (directed by Khadeeji Abu-Ali, Arabic language, French subt., 1982. 
          24 min.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" color="#666666">"Wa baid" was made in Palestine, 
          it takes the story of a group of Palestinian kids from Ramallah and 
          its vicinity. The film shows a realistic picture of children's lives 
          during the ongoing Intifada. <br>
          (directed&amp; produced by : Anas Al-Ili, Rama Al-Hajj &amp; Wafa Al-Hoorani.

        <p><font size="-1" color="#666666">The Sakakini announces that it will 
          embark on a goodwill program in Ramadan. This program is directed toward 
          the people who have suffered the most under the closure and Israeli 
          aggression; the wounded, students and low ranking soldiers who live 
          far away from their families and can't visit them. The program consists 
          of four "iftar" (break-the-fast) meals followed by a musical/ 
          entertainment activity at the Centre. The guests will then receive care 
          packages while leaving. <br>
          The Centre is looking for volunteers who can help with the organizing 
          of such a program; if you can donate your time, money, or help with 
          the campaign to collect items for the care packages. Or, if you have 
          any good ideas, please call the Centre or pass by. Your support is necessary 
          to make these Ramadan evenings work &amp; show solidarity with the people 
          who have suffered the most…</font></p>
