<br><b>Projects</b>
<br><i>Here is a summary of the activities undertaken by the Sakakini Centre that aim towards the long-term development of the arts in Palestine, and deal with Palestinian cultural identity.</i>

<p><u>Visual Arts Nurture Program: (2001-2002)</u>
<br><img src="/sakakini.org/events/proj1.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">The Sakakini received funding from the Ford Foundation for a two-year pilot program to nurture the visual arts. The program will benefit schoolchildren, government school art teachers, and young artists. The program became operational with the establishment of a new office wing at the Centre, and the hiring of a new employee, a visual arts coordinator- to handle all aspects of the Sakakini visual arts programs in general. School workshops began on February 2001. The program includes the following: 
</p><ul>
<li>Organizing school visits by local schools throughout the school year to visit Sakakini exhibits, and receive a free copy of exhibit catalogues. 5 out of 8 of the schools are government schools, three are co-ed., three are girls’ schools, and two are boys’ schools. 
</li><li>Holding an art workshop for the students after each visit. <img src="/sakakini.org/events/proj2.jpg" align="right" hspce="5">
</li><li>Publishing catalogues for each art exhibit held at the Sakakini. 
</li><li>Support for first exhibits, by publishing a catalogue, and providing young artists with funding for exhibit supplies. 
</li><li>Organizing training and development workshops for local arts teachers 
</li><li>Establishing a visual arts video and slide library, with a focus on modern Arab art. 
</li><li>Working on the promotion of young Palestinian artists outside of Palestine (artists residencies, exhibits, etc..) 
</li></ul>This program builds on the work of the Sakakini in the last 4 years in this field, but the grant will make this work more intensive and systematic. 


<p><u>100 Shaheed-100 Lives project: (2001-2002)</u>
<br>Please go to <a href="/sakakini.org/shaheed" style="">www.sakakini.org/shaheed</a>


</p><p><u>Media Watch project: (2001)</u>
<br>Funded by the Heinrich Boell foundation in Ramallah, this project aims to monitor and assess the Palestinian media’s coverage of the arts, the project is to start in Spring and last for two months, followed by a workshop to review the findings.


</p><p><u>Art Criticism Initiation project: (2001)</u>
<br>The Heinrich Boell foundation in Ramallah funded a project to hold an art criticism initiation workshop in 2001, to be held in cooperation with the UK branch of the International Association of Art Critics (AICA).


</p><p><u>Creative Writing project: (2000) </u>
<br><img src="/sakakini.org/events/proj3.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">An intensive creative writing project run by Libyan-American poet and creative writing professor Khaled Mattawa was held at the Sakakini in June 2000. The pilot project gathered twelve young writers and was made possible by funding from the US Consulate’s information office and the hospitality of the Qattan Foundation center. Besides helping young writers, the project was instrumental in identifying problems and opportunities in developing creative writing in Palestine. The Sakakini is currently developing follow up initiatives to establish a permanent creative writing program in Palestine. 

</p><p><u>Documentary Film: (2001)</u>
<br>“Behind the Checkpoint” is a documentary born out of the Aqsa Intifada, filming four very different Palestinians who each in his/her own distinct way symbolizes a facet of the Palestinian struggle. The film will be directed by film historian and director Alia Arasoghly, and is to be funded by the Palestinian Welfare Association.  


</p><p><u>Experimental Youth Theatre project: (1999)</u>
<br><img src="/sakakini.org/events/proj4.jpg" align="right" hspace="5">This was a two-time experimental project undertaken with Ramallah's Dar-el-Amal, the only rehabilitation center in the West Bank for young offenders. The project consisted the first time of organizing a writing workshop using the life experiences of these young boys, that culminated in their writing a short play made up of skits depicting typical young men's lives in Palestine. The play titled "Hafla" (Party) was bursting with dance and music. Given the success of this project, a second project was started this time in co-operation with the Beit Sahour home for girls, also the only West Bank center for young female offenders. This time there were joint rehearsals between the girls and boys at the Sakakini, that also led to a the writing of a play titled "Moutheer" (Thriller) dealing with issues of love, marriage, criminality, etc.. The two workshops were led by Algerian-French playwright Mohammed Rwabhi, and funded by the Swiss agency pro-Helvetia. 


</p><p><u>Nakba commemoration program: (1996-1997)</u>
<br><img src="/sakakini.org/events/proj5.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><br>1997 marked the 30th anniversary of the occupation of the West Bank &amp; Gaza, and 1998 the 50th anniversary of the Nakba. Because of the capital importance of these events on Palestinian history, present, lives, identity, culture and future; the Sakakini Center devoted the majority of its 1997 &amp; 1998 activities to these issues, in an exercise in dialogue and remembrance. The program featured: 
</p><ul>
<li>The realization of the first web site on the <a href="/alnakba.org/" style="pointer-events: none;">Nakba</a> telling the Palestinian story to the world. 
</li><li>Ten lectures by a number of prominent Palestinian intellectuals on the influence of the 1948 and 1967 events on their lives and work, the level of their representation in Palestinian arts, and their effects on Palestinian identity and culture: its complexity, unity and future, 
</li><li>15 testimonies given in a series of "town meetings" by survivors of the most salient events of 1948, 50 years to the day after their occurrence. <img src="/sakakini.org/events/proj6.jpg" align="right" hspace="5">
</li><li>First ever video recording of testimonies of the survivors of the <a href="/alnakba.org/" style="pointer-events: none;">Nakba</a> to create a sample visual/oral archive of the <a href="/alnakba.org/" style="pointer-events: none;">Nakba</a>. The tapes were distributed freely to local Palestinian universities and research centers. 
</li><li>Press outreach and sensitization, through provision of information and contacts to the international press on the <a href="/alnakba.org/" style="pointer-events: none;">Nakba</a>. This program was the only one undertaken by a Palestinian art and culture organization in Palestine, and gained great coverage in the Arab and international media. 
</li><li>Documentary film screenings on Palestinian refugees, the Palestinian struggle, Palestinian culture, etc.. 
</li><li>Photo exhibit on the <a href="/alnakba.org/" style="pointer-events: none;">Nakba</a> and its aftermath, and the life of Palestinian refugees. 
</li></ul>

<p><b>Proposal stage projects</b>

</p><p><u>Sakakini Diaries: </u>
<br>This project consists of the publishing the personal diaries of a leading Palestinian historical personality, and the centre’s namesake, Khalil Sakakini (1878-1953). The project is based on 34 volumes of diaries, written almost daily between 1908 and 1952. The project calls for the editing and footnoting of the texts, as well as their publication and distribution. This project is conducted in co-operation with the Institute for Palestine Studies (IPS). 

</p><p><u>The upgrade of the Sakakini performance hall: </u>
<br>This project comprises several tasks: Improving the lighting system, installing a storage space, installing a space for changing, and waiting area for performers, and equipping the hall with air conditioning. 

</p></font><p><font color="#655658"><u>Establishment of the first public sculpture studio in Palestine: </u>
<br>The project calls for the establishment of a public sculpture studio in Ramallah, that will make available tools that are expensive to buy, as well as a dedicated space for sculpture now unavailable to the few practicing sculptors in Palestine, and the many would be sculptors. Due to the particular nature of sculpture work (need of a large space, noise, dirt) no Palestinian artist has the means to set himself up in a sculpture studio, despite the plentiful Jerusalem stone, and the importance of stone in Palestinian crafts history and heritage. The Sakakini hopes to foster through this Studio, artistic creativity in harmony with local artists’ natural environment, and to develop young and new talents in the arts. The Studio will be open to all that apply and who meet certain criteria, and they will be provided opportunities for training. There will be a focus in attracting young artists. The project also calls for the establishment of a sculpture focused video slides and book library, and the organization of a hands on initiation workshop at the start of the project with a prominent Arab sculptor, and finally, the sending a of a few sculptors abroad for arts residencies and studies.
