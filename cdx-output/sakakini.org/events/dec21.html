<br>This is a rescheduling, after a postponement due to its previous coincidence with a day of mourning. The Book Club
will host Ahmad Awad for a book signing &amp; discussion of his fifth &amp; latest novel "Qurmuti", which won critical acclaim.
The novel tries to shed light on the political, social, cultural &amp; religious reasons for the fall of a leader &amp; the loss of
power. The book centers on the theft of the Black Stone from Mecca to Bahrein by Qurmuti in A.D. 920, &amp; the accompanying social revolution there. </font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" color="#666666"><b>SPECIAL SOLIDARITY RAMADAN EVENTS: </b><br>

We are pleased to announce the success in gathering enough support to hold 4 solidarity Iftar evenings later this month: One each for female college students &amp; bedridden wounded of the Intifada, &amp; two evenings for low ranking soldiers. Our deepest thanks go to the companies that have  generously sponsored two of these evenings: The Jordan
Bank &amp; The Coca-Cola company. 
Special thanks go to the companies &amp; organizations that made in-kind contributions to the care packages to be
distributed to each of the 200 participants: Unipal, Jerusalem Drug Company, Max Supermarket, Oasis Perfumery,
Rana Center, the Dentists' Association, the House of Poetry, &amp; the Palestinian Writers Union. 
Thanks go also to the National Conservatory of Music &amp; the Urmawi Center for Oriental Music, for donating their
performances at each Iftar, &amp; to the Bardouni Restaurant. Last but not least, heartfelt thanks go to the numerous
private individuals -Palestinian &amp; expatriate- who have kindly donated their time &amp; money to make these Iftars
possible.
