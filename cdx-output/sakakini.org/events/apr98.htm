April, 1998: 
</b></p><p>

</p><p>
- The Centre hosted the exhibit of Syrian artist Marwan Qassab Bashi. Marwan is one of the most important Arab artists working today, and enjoys great fame in Europe. This exhibit, organized in cooperation with the Ramallah Goethe Institut, was held as a result of Marwan's wish to bequeath to "the children of Palestine" a collection of 75 etchings of great value on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Nakba. These were distributed between the Sakakini and Bir Zeit University. 
</p><p>
Professor Jorn Merkert, director of the Berlin Museum of Modern Art and chief expert on Marwan's work, attended the opening, commented a short documentary film on Marwan after the opening, and gave a lecture and slide show at the Bir Zeit opening. 
</p><p>
This important gestures underscores the solidarity of international artists with the struggle of the Palestinian people, and the gift will serve as the nucleus for a museum of contemporary art works donated by international artists, in solidarity with the people of Palestine, that the Sakakini will try to establish in Ramallah. 
</p><p>
- Finally, among the Center's Nakba 50th anniversary commemoration activities: Historian and educator Dr. Ibrahim Abu Lughod spoke about Arab-Americans within the "Palestinian Intellectuals &amp; the Nakba Lecture Series", 3 testimonies by eyewitnesses to the Nakba were organized: Three survivors of the Deir Yassin massacre, one survivor of the Haifa exodus, and participants in the Qastal and Bab El Wad battles of April 1948. Finally, the ARTE TV 1998 documentary film: "Al-Nakba: The Palestinian Catastrophe", was screened to very mixed reviews.
