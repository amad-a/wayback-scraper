<b>** PREMIERE FILM SCREENING: "After Jenin" By Dir. Jenny Morgan <br>
** THURSDAY 17/10 @ 5:00 PM </b><br>
The filming took place immediately after the first withdrawal of Israeli forces from Jenin &amp; other West Bank towns,
following a month long killing and destruction rampage last April. Filmed in Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah and Tel Aviv, the
film interweaves the story of events on the ground of the massacre perpetrated by the invading forces in the Jenin
refugee camp. It also includes a brief account of the historical events that led to the establishment of Israel, &amp; the
several attempts to reach peace agreements. The documentary also features interviews with Palestinian academics,
multi-national officials, and activists from Amnesty International. Lastly, the film also shows excerpts of the open day for
kids held at the Sakakini right after the lifting of the April siege. A discussion animated by Dr. Ali Jarbawi, one of the
personalities interviewed in the film will follow. <br>
(Dir. Jenny Morgan, 50 min., Language Arabic &amp; English, 2002) </p><p>


<b>** CHILDREN'S ACTIVITY: “Nakhleh Esheber” <br>
** SUNDAY 20/10 @ 4:00 PM </b><br>
The well known character created by Mohammed Amous and Yaqoub Abu Arafeh, &amp; acted by Abu Arafeh will meet
kids in an afternoon of play acting, story telling, &amp; educational games to allow children to express what they are going
through in these difficult times. <br>
* This activity is held thanks to the support of the young Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Bin Khalifa Al Maktoom. </p><p>


<b>** PREMIERE FILM SCREENING: “A Testimony of Birth” by Alia Arasoghly <br>
** THURSDAY 24/10 @ 5:00 PM </b><br>
This new documentary film sheds light on the new tragic and infamous reality of Palestinian mothers giving birth under
the inhumane conditions of occupation &amp; curfews, in open fields, by roadsides, or at checkpoints. The film profiles a
number of women who have tried to give birth under these conditions, as well as a woman who trains women in remote
areas to assist in child births where medical assistance is hard to reach.&nbsp; A discussion will follow the screening. 
(17 min., Arabic Lang. Palestinian Dialect/English Subtitles, 2002) </p><p>


Thank you &amp; we hope to see you at all these events.
