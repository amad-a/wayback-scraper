</p><p>
* The Sakakini hosted a first of its kind exhibit original works and prints by a master of XX Th. century art: Victor Vasarely. The show was made possible by Tibor Csepei, owner of the collection exhibited, and friend of the artist. The opening was followed by a slide show and lecture about the artist’s work.

* Lecture by Dr. Suad Amiry, Riwaq’s director, on Palestinian Throne Villages, their history and architectural characteristics. These villages dotting the Palestinian countryside, served as tax collection centers, and were the seats of landed families who transplanted there the architectural styles of 19th century Palestinian urban mansions.
