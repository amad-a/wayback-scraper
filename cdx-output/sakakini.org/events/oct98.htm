<p>
* As renovation work continued at the Sakakini, activities were kept to a minimum. Work continues on building the outer wall, storage room, new gate,  and bookstore space. 
</p><p>
* The main event of the month was the opening of the first solo exhibit of Kamal Boullata in Palestine in 14 years: “Twelve Lanterns for Granada”. The show was made possible by the gift of the works exhibited and of the display cases by the UNESCO, and by a grant from the United States Information Service office in Jerusalem. The opening was followed by a slide show/discussion with the artist where he discussed his creative process, and his focus on the motif of the square. Later in the week, a meeting was organized at the Centre between the artist and a number of local visual artists. 
</p><p>
* Finally, historian Dr. Adel Manna’ gave a lecture on the fall of the Galilee, recounting the military operations, deportations and  massacres that took place 50 years ago this month;  carried out by the Israeli army -not by Zionist independent gangs-, and in violation of the UN partition plan. The lecture was illustrated with slides and documents form the archives of the Israeli army.
