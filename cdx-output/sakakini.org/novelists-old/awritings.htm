<p><font size="+1">Shammas’ first novel, <i>Arabesques</i>, was written in
Hebrew and published in 1986 in Israel to wide acclaim. The book’s themes
and rich and multilayered Hebrew raised questions about Israelis’ exclusive
ownership of the language, and was hailed as "a turning point in Israel’s
cultural life". Among his awards and honors: the 1991-92 Whiting Award,
and the 1993 Lila Wallace-Reader’s Digest Writer’s Award. </font></p>
