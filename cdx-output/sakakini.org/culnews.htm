For the first time since the 1930s, two religious  religious-folkloric festivals were revived:  The Nabi Musa Festival in Jericho, and the Nabi Saleh Festival in the village of Nabi Saleh near Ramallah, each one for a week. The festivals (or <i>Mawassem</i>) saw the participation of scout troops, religious processions, and handicrafts stands from all the cities of the West Bank. Because of the continued closure, there were no Gaza participants.  The festivals are dedicated to prophets who have shrines in those areas. Both festivals were first established by Saladin in post-crusades time, and were popular  yearly celebrations, interrupted by the political upheavals that have beset Palestine since the 1930s.
