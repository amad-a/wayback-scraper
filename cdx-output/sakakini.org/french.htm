<p>
<font size="+1">
The most significant cultural event of this spring did not take place in Palestine, but in France, with the start in April of the three month long Palestinian Cultural Spring celebrations. The Spring is the result of collaborative efforts of the French ministries of Foreign Affairs and Culture, a number of French cultural agencies and institutions, the Palestinian Delegation to France, and the Palestinian Ministry of Culture, upon a French initiative. It is the first-ever event of its kind, giving a panoramic view of  contemporary Palestinian culture. All the events &amp; activities open in Paris, and tour the most important French cities. There are currently no web resources on the Spring, but below is a sample of some of the most important events:
