<!-- <P><FONT SIZE=+1>By the combination of its unique aesthetic setting, and
its mission goals, the KSCC hopes to contribute to a renaissance of Palestinian
arts &amp; culture. The KSCC's mission is articulated around the following
goals:</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>* Fostering arts appreciation,</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;* Acquainting the artistic community and the general
public with new art forms or innovations,</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>* Strengthening public awareness of the intellectual,
artistic and cultural Palestinian heritage,</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>* Facilitating cultural exchanges, and</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;* Spreading Palestinian arts &amp; culture to the
outside world.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Since its opening in May 1996, the Sakakini functioned&nbsp;
as a branch of the Palestinian Ministry of Culture, albeit with programmatic
independence. Within a year of its opening, consultations assessing the
Sakakini’s work recommended that in order for it to better fulfill its
mission and serve the local community, the Sakakini should change its status
to a non governmental organization (NGO).</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For that purpose, a founding board made up of local artists
and philanthropists was convened in July 1997,&nbsp; among its tasks was
the drafting of&nbsp; bylaws and helping in&nbsp; fundraising. In May 1998,
the Sakakini obtained its NGO registration from the Palestinian Ministry
of the Interior, and a tax exempt status granted to non-profit organizations
from the Ministry of Finance. In August 1998, an agreement was signed with
the Ministry of Culture, whereby the Sakakini’s building remains the property
of the Ministry, while its premises are used rent free by the new Sakakini-NGO.
The first general assembly meeting is due to be convened in September.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>FOUNDERS:</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>The founding board also includes honorary members Dumia
and Hala Sakakini, daughters of Khalil Sakakini. The Sakakini’s general
assembly of 50 members, elected in October 1998 and February 1999 the members
of the Center's administrative and honorary bodies</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;


<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>FINANCES:</FONT></B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Current sources of revenue are: donations, project-specific
grants, members’ dues, partial coverage of overhead costs by the Carmel
literary quarterly, and ticket sales from events held at the Centre.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Sakakini’s first funding priority after its change
of status is to establish an endowment fund to enable it to pursue its
activities in financial security, and constitute a funding base for future
cultural support initiatives in Palestine.</FONT>

Centre, and if you live or have a bank account in the US, you can make
