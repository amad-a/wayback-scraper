              <p>In the 3rd exhibit for Rudayna, we behold watercolors on silk. The artist focuses in her paintings on the shape of the square and on many color arrangements displayed in patterns that are derived from the old common rugs of our Arabic tradition.
</p><p>
And this is what Rudayna has to say about her exhibit…
</p><p>
“I would like to dismantle my world into squares that I can play with and then create in each square little worlds of my own. I would then like to roam freely in the space of color…
It is assumed that the square is a symbol of logic and reason, but does that cancel out the primitive expression that exists in this small world, which is enclosed by lines? 
Have not we, as children, started by dividing our surroundings into small spaces?
Is not the most beautiful of our creations that of a cover to protect and shelter us???
I feel like I were a queen reigning on each square, free with my “scribbles” &amp; colors.
My constant problem is that I always prefer the mischievous square that never calms down and jumps out of its perimeter as it wishes. It’s as if I seem to prefer not to be surrounded by a square that is easily comprehended or its location, area and color straightforwardly depicted; ‘a surrendering square’.
I am fond of uncovering my squares from beneath the clouds and from the depth of the fog, so that they render translucent and clear, because only behind the veils of mystery lies the prevailing truth…
Sometimes, several squares slip from my grasp and they revolt against me or for the truth of the matter, against the conscious side of me, to therefore entwine something I have not yet drawn or either to express a piece of imagination that had slipped from my hold.<br>
Yet I have discovered that those “mischievous” squares remain the ones that engrave me and portray my features, my illusions and my dreams…”
