“In the course of acknowledging, confronting and therefore expressing the world in a more exposing manner, refusing and releasing it out of the scope of the self that has been tortured with the pains of exile since childhood, it is not enough for that self to observe the world, which rotates around its contradictions and is encircled in suffering and pain, or to grow in a world not your own, distinct in its own mosaics and formations. Here in Baghdad, the years of the sixties will be portrayed in the small pathways, winding allies and its high edifices, those of the Baghdadi houses that were set in a way which could enable its inhabitants to face the midsummer and the madness of the songs that behold the moans of pain from those who are ill, being enchanted by the infinite beauty of the scene. This scene, which is made up of the harmonious merges of shadow, light and earthly colors, represented the shadow of the desert that resides near that city. And I was the eyewitness of such beauty and this led me to expose the secret of the wound that was formed in the shadows of the humid bending walls in Taht Al-Tikkiyeh Quarter, in the middle of Baghdad. That world, with all its minute details, was simple and beautiful; it managed to ease thinking of an obscure future.”

“The elementary school, the waters penetrating the small paths like a palpitating vein spreading in the curves of the city, the yellow light gleaming from the cracks of the surfaces and a sun that chars the tinplates that cover the rooftops of the houses and colors the walls and, maybe those pictures formed a guide towards drawing, being the only outlet that would separate between the feeling of estrangement and a global creation of the self.”
