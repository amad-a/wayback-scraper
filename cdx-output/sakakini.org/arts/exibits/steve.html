<b>The artist:</b><br>
              Steve Sabella was born in 1975 and grew up in the Old City of Jerusalem. Following his studies at the Collège des Frères de la Salle, he enrolled in the Jerusalem School of Photography where he received his Diploma in Art Photography three years later. Steve’s visual capacity is well developed and impressive. His works show a balance between authentic ideas and visual expression. This is shown in his ability to give a new visual meaning to the photos. His approach to photography has been both professional and highly personal. He has exhibited many times in solo and group exhibits in Jerusalem and now for the first time he exhibits in Ramallah and in the Khalil Sakakini Cultural Centre. It is worth mentioning that he has been rewarded by the Qattan Foundation a shared prize with two other artists for the Young Artists Award for 2002.
