Besides obvious talent, his success owed much to the leitmotif of Abu Shaqra' s works: The potted cactus. It was hijacked by some prominent Israeli critics as signifying Abu Shaqra' s variations on the Israeli Sabra (the Hebrew word for cactus, referring to Israelis born in Palestine). Other critics reduced Abu Shaqra's thorny cacti to a mere reflection of the pain of the cancer that was eating him away. The original Palestinian specificity of the symbol of the cactus (Sabbar) and its emblematic national connotations were expressly denied. It makes sense that for Abu Shaqra -a young man of rural Galillean background- the cactus would be fraught with symbolism, especially after his transplant to Tel Aviv, where he lived close to the ruins of Arab buildings destroyed in 1948. We can also see that with the progress of his illness, the depiction of the potted cactus became more stark and tortured, as a joining of the three traits in Abu Shaqra's life: His Palestinian identity, his foreignness in Israel, and the progress of his disease. Further, it is sad to note that while he had refused to participate in an Israeli 40th anniversary art exhibit, after his death, his works were featured in the Israel Museum's 50th anniversary of Israel art retrospective...
