Saïd was born in 1957 in the Galilee village of Nahaf, and  received his first artistic instruction from Palestinian artist Abed Abdi. He graduated with honors from the Berlin Academy, and received a two-year painting grant. Saïd also won a competition held among Berlin artists whereupon the Berlin department of culture purchased some of his works. He recently returned home after spending years studying in the finest German artistic institutions (Berlin Higher Academy of Arts). Saïd studied in Berlin with the most famous Arab artist working in Europe: Marwan Qassab-Bashi who singled him out among his students for praise. He has exhibited widely in Germany, as well as in Morocco at Assila, in France and Belgium. He exhibited in the Sakakini in 1999.
