      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Badr is renewed as the
      Mujahideen wore the clothes of the Sahaba … Hamza, Saad and Muthana are
      back to teach the occupiers lessons in heroism. The butcher Sharon
      believed that his assassinations would wipe out and end resistance and
      would defeat our giant Brigades. He dared to assassinate and murder but he
      was disappointed. Who will stop the stormy winds? Who will silence the
      roaring bullets? Who will face the blazing bombs? For our soldiers will
      attack, from the fields, from the mountains and valleys of Palestine, from
      Nablus, Jenin, Gaza, Al-Quds, from all areas of Palestine. The butcher
      Sharon will pay the price for his foolishness and tyranny 100 Zionists as
      a first batch of revenge for martyr Mahmoud Abu Hannoud and all martyrs of
      our people Insha’allah.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The revenge operations
      started on the land of Gaza then Affula and later firing incidents took
      place at settlements in the West Bank (in Jordan Valley). Today
      “Israel” was covered with hell after the revenge battles started in
      Al-Quds, Gaza, Yaffa, the Valley and Jenin and Zionist remains were
      scattered everywhere. Last night two lions of the Qassam Brigades the
      heroes Nabil Amre Halabiya and Osama Mohammed Eid ignited three
      qualitative explosions that rocked the heart of Al-Quds inflicting scores
      of dead and wounded. Later on Gaza woke up to bullets of two other Qassam
      lions (Jihad Al-Masri and Massalama Al-Araj) that led to the death of a
      settler and the wounding of several others. The Mujahideen then fired a
      number of projectiles at Zionist settlements. In the Jordan Valley the
      Qassam lions blasted an explosive device in a Zionist bus that was totally
      burnt and filmed on videotape. The city of Jenin also shared in the Qassam
      grand operations where a Zionist settler was killed near the settlement of
      Qadmim. This afternoon our cavalier Maher Mohiudeen Hobeisha, 23, from the
      Nablus city blew himself up to open hell for Zionists. He exploded a
      Zionist double-decker in Haifa. Death haunted Zionists from various spots,
      burning scores and even hundreds of them, destroying and killing more than
      twenty Zionists and wounding hundreds according to the enemy’s own
      reports.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Sharon and his gang were afraid to death from our
      hero Abu Hannoud whose operations brought shame on them. They breathed a
      sigh of relief after committing their crime and hateful joy was drawn on
      their dirty faces as they drank champagne to rejoice and boasted their
      crime over the media. But time has come for those rats to return to their
      holes after the Qassam lions showed up anew to teach the occupiers a
      lesson of heroism and sacrifice. The Zionist occupiers’ alleged security
      did not protect them from the lions. Furthermore, neither the Zionists’
      planes would protect them from the freedom fighters’ anger nor their
      tanks would protect them from the Mujahideen bombs. And we will continue
      along the path God willing.</p>
