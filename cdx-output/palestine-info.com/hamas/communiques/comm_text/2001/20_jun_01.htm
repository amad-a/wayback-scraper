      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Commenting on the reported deterioration of Eng.
      Ibrahim Ghoushe’s health condition, who is detained in Amman Airport, a
      responsible source in the Hamas Movement stated the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We follow up with utmost
      concern in the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, along with family of
      Eng. Ghoushe the information that recently pointed to the worsening of his
      health condition. This deterioration comes at a time when the Jordanian
      Authority is still insisting on detaining him in Amman Airport under
      inhuman circumstances for the sixth consecutive day and insisting on
      preventing him from entering his country while trying to deport him anew.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Eng. Ghoushe, 65, suffers
      from high blood pressure along with other diseases that necessitate
      constant health care and necessary treatment in fixed dates under
      doctors’ supervision. Detaining him and refusing his admission into a
      hospital might pose a danger to his health and life.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In the light of the
      aforementioned and in the light of the Jordanian Authority’s refusal to
      hospitalize Ghoushe and its rejection of numerous requests to see him,
      including demands by the chief of the Jordanian bar and the chief of the
      Jordanian doctors syndicate, we hold the Jordanian government and its
      security bodies the full responsibility over health, life and security of
      the Engineer. We demand his immediate release and an end to his oppressive
      detention to enable him enter his country Jordan.</p>
