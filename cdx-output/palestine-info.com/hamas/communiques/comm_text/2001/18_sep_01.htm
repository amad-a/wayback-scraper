      <p class="MsoTitle" align="center"><i>In the name of Allah the most
      Gracious the most Merciful</i></p>

      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="center"><b><font color="#0000FF">Statement
      on the American and international moves after the New York and Washington
      explosions and the Zionist blatant incitement</font></b><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Zionist enemy was not
      content with escalation of its aggression and terrorism against the
      Palestinian people including storming, besieging and starving cities and
      refugee camps in addition to murder, demolition and destruction,
      exploiting the world’s preoccupation with the explosions in New York and
      Washington. It even started provoking America and the West against Arabs
      and Muslims in addition to Palestinian resistance forces. The Zionist
      entity intentionally and cheaply mixed up the cards in the region and
      allied with America and the West in fighting the so-called Islamic
      terrorism at a time when Palestinian blood is being shed daily and
      profusely as a result of the escalation of Zionist terrorism in Palestine.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Amidst such an atmosphere
      American diplomacy stepped up efforts to establish the so-called
      “international alliance against terrorism”. It tried to involve the
      biggest possible number of Arab and Islamic countries to serve as an
      international cover for a large-scale war that the USA was preparing
      against Afghanistan and maybe other countries despite the fact that
      investigations have not yet pinpointed the party responsible for those
      explosions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The American
      administration resorted to paving the way for its coming strikes through
      its media and statements of its leaders. American president Bush even
      described that war as a crusade! It is strange to witness a state of fear
      and panic in the Arab and Islamic region that made a number of those
      governments, despite their remoteness from what happened, to bow to
      American dictates and pressures even at the expense of Arab and Islamic
      interests.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Islamic Resistance
      Movement (Hamas) followed up the US-led diplomatic, security and military
      activities and the accompanying blatant Zionist incitement and the
      possible repercussions on the conflict with the Zionist entity and would
      like to assert the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- In the light of the
      recent spate of explosions in America, the Hamas Movement would like to
      affirm that it is against violence being committed against innocent
      civilians anywhere in the world especially that the Palestinian people can
      understand the suffering more than many nations as victims of constant
      Zionist terrorism.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- We urge all countries
      to direct their potentials and efforts towards fighting the most dangerous
      terrorism in the world and the most organized and threatening to global
      peace and security namely Zionist terrorism (state terrorism). Such
      terrorism is represented in occupying Palestinian lands and practicing the
      most brutal forms of repression, humiliation and terrorism against the
      Palestinian people making use<span dir="RTL" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Traditional Arabic&quot;"> </span>of American weapons
      and political cover.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- We would like to stress
      that the Palestinian people’s resistance of Zionist occupation is a
      legitimate one that could never be associated with terrorism. We would
      also like to warn here of the Zionist enemy’s attempt to mix up the
      cards and rally international backing to strikes against the Palestinian,
      Arab and Islamic peoples at the pretext of fighting terrorism and to
      distract the attention away from the Palestinian people’s demands for
      freedom, liberation and independence.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">4- The Islamic Resistance
      Movement, Hamas, asks the free world countries, especially the Arab and
      Islamic countries, to be ware of the so-called international alliance to
      fight terrorism along with its consequent measures and dictates. We
      believe that such an alliance targets labeling Islam, Arabs and Muslims as
      terrorists in addition to providing legitimacy and an Arab and Islamic
      cover for an expected American aggression that would realize economic and
      strategic goals for the USA along its plan of boosting its hegemony on the
      world. It would also provide Washington with a golden opportunity to get
      even with a number of countries, forces and groups in the region.
      Furthermore, it would serve Zionist goals of persecuting Palestinian
      resistance forces and making use of the emergency situation to liquidate
      the Palestine cause according to Zionist schemes.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">5- The Hamas Movement also
      asks the Arab and Islamic countries not to extend support or cover to this
      declared war against Afghanistan or any Arab or Islamic country. This war
      is not in the interest of our Nation but rather against it. Furthermore,
      this war will not serve as the solution to the phenomenon of hostility and
      violence against American interests but would rather boost such a trend
      and would increase the affected nations and peoples’ hatred of American
      foreign policies.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Islamic Resistance
      Movement, Hamas, while engaged in its conflict against the Zionist enemy
      in the occupied territories, would like to affirm, in such difficult
      circumstances and in the light of attempts by many parties to win favour
      with aggressive forces, that the Palestinian people would go ahead in
      their efforts to liberate their lands and holy places and to win freedom
      and that they would persist in the intifada and resistance against the
      terrorist Zionist enemy until ejection of occupation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><i>&nbsp;“O
      ye who believe! If ye obey the Unbelievers, they will drive you back on
      your heels, and ye will turn back (from Faith) to your own loss.<span dir="RTL" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Traditional Arabic&quot;">
