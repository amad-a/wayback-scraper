      <p class="MsoTitle" align="center"><i>In the name of Allah the most
      Gracious the most Merciful</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>Yes to
      our national unity and armed resistance<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>No to
      cowardice and capitulation<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Our Mujahid people:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Our people everywhere, our
      people in Tulkarm, Qalqilya, Ramallah, Jenin, Bethlehem, Beit Jala and in
      all areas of Palestine … may Allah be with you while facing the biggest
      terrorist force on Earth. You are facing it with bare chests, flesh and
      blood while declaring that you would not be eliminated and that with
      Jihad, patience and sacrifices you will survive forever since you are
      backed by right and determination. You will continue to survive with the
      grace of Allah until victory and liberation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Our proud, Mujahid
      people:</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Here the enemy is storming
      cities, killing scores of our people, arresting and kidnapping hundreds
      while his war minister arrogantly declares that he will not withdraw from
      the cities that his army stormed. He was thus affirming that such
      practices were our enemy’s sole program in dealing with our people. The
      best proof is that the enemy’s arrests and assassinations had covered
      all those included in the list of wanted persons that was handed to the
      Palestinian Authority during the security coordination meetings.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We affirm that the whole
      world is called upon to condemn our enemy’s crimes namely the siege,
      murder, assassinations and detentions and should immediately and
      practically act to put an end to those crimes. We also declare that our
      Jihad would continue until ejection of occupation, that our people’s
      resistance would not be deterred by such aggressions and that our
      people’s steadfastness would not be shaken by those aggressions
      regardless of the murder and destruction tools used.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Our Mujahid people:</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Despite that outrageous
      aggression, the shelling, destruction and storming and despite the fall of
      scores of martyrs and hundreds of wounded we are surprised to hear
      discordant voices speaking about a ceasefire. They even call for not
      confronting the aggression as if they were asking our people to allow the
      enemy to slaughter them the way it wished hoping to satisfy our enemy or
      please the American administration, which declares on each and every
      occasion its backing to our enemy and protects it at international forums.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Our people have the right
      to ask: which party would benefit from such calls? Is it in the interest
      of the Palestinian people to remain arms-folded while being slaughtered?
      Why are some parties so keen to satisfy the American administration and
      woo terrorist Sharon endangering the lives of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>our people for the sake of reaching that goal?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Our proud people:</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In such circumstances and
      at a time when we are in dire need of unity of ranks and national unity,
      the Palestinian Authority issues a very serious decision <u>outlawing all
      military wings of our national and Islamic factions.</u> This entails
      prosecution of all Mujahideen in a treacherous stab in the back of our
      people’s Mujahideen who are united over the resistance option.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>We denounce that
      decision and urge the PA to rescind it and request its support of the
      Mujahideen along with safeguarding them and supplying them with necessary
      arms. We also affirm the importance of ending all forms of security
      coordination and meetings with the enemy and warn the PA of the dangerous
      repercussions of its continued tampering with our people’s unity and the
      national forces and factions’ united stand in resisting occupation.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>We ask all Palestinian
      forces especially the resistance brigades and our sons in the police and
      national security to shoulder their responsibility in defending their
      people, cities and villages. We urge them to unite in face of the
      aggression and to reject any procedure that might infringe on national
      unity or aid our enemy in achieving its mean aims. Let all of you carry
      the slogan: <i>“Truly Allah loves those who fight in His Cause in battle
      array, as if they were a solid cemented structure.”<o:p>
      </o:p>
