      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Zionist criminal
      mentality invented a new form of terrorism and murder against our unarmed
      people namely exploding residential buildings full of innocent civilians
      with the use of booby-trapped cars in each of Gaza and Ramallah killing
      children, women and men. At the same time Zionist foreign minister Shimon
      Peres was embarking on his deceptive tours misleading the world into
      believing that the Zionist entity was heading towards calming down the
      situation!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Apparently the Zionist
      interior minister Uzi Landau’s threats to perpetrate explosions in a
      number of Arab capitals especially Damascus and Beirut had already started
      in cities of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Our people’s various
      forces should be on the alert in view of the seriousness of the current
      stage and be prepared to confront it especially when the enemy was
      practicing its crimes against our people in a very serious duality run by
      the terrorists Sharon and Peres. Murder, destruction and escalation on the
      ground are practiced while deceptive political maneuvers are launched in
      various capitals to cover up for the enemy’s crimes in the field. The
      goal is one namely to crush the intifada and resistance and to spread
      despair among our people in the possibility of liberating their lands and
      restoring their rights in addition to pressuring the Palestinian Authority
      into returning to the negotiations according to Sharon’s conditions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Confronted by such
      serious developments, we affirm the following:</b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">1- We call on our Mujahid people along with their
      forces, factions and brave resistance groups to intensify efforts and
      mobilize potentials to defend our people and to continue and escalate the
      intifada in addition to stepping up resistance operations against enemy
      targets.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- We urge leaders of our
      Arab and Islamic Nation to stop dealings and meetings with the Zionist
      enemy. We beseech them to drop the mediation roles or initiatives and
      invite them to support our people’s intifada and resistance and to
      provide our people with political protection which a religious and
      national duty.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- We ask the PA to
      suspend all political and security meetings with the criminal Zionist
      enemy and to refrain from passing resolutions curbing the resistance or
      dissolving popular resistance committees because our people have the full
      right to defend themselves with all means.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">4-We condemn the PA’
      return to the policy of political detention and demand the immediate
      release of Mujahid Dr. Abdul Aziz Ranteesi and the Mujahid hero Mahmoud
      Abu Hannoud and the rest of the detainees. The natural place for leaders
      of our people’s Jihad is the confrontation arena and not prisons.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>In conclusion, we
      affirm that such explosions would not terrorize our people and that our
      people, with their factions and masses, reject to go backward. Our people
      insist on their intifada and resistance until liberation of their lands
      and ejection of occupation.</b></p>
