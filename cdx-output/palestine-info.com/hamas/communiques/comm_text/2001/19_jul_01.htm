      2001</font></em></strong></u></font></p>

      <p class="MsoTitle" align="center"><b><font color="#0000FF">Sharon will
      pay the price and our battle with the Zionists is open</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><i>“Will ye not fight
      people who violated their oaths, plotted to expel the Messenger, and took
      the aggressive by being the first (to assault) you? Do ye fear them? Nay,
      it is Allah Whom ye should more justly fear, if ye believe!”<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </i></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Zionist aggression
      against our unarmed people is still escalating along with the policy of
      assassination, kidnap, destruction of houses, siege, starvation and
      massacres, the latest of which being the heinous carnage in Bethlehem that
      killed four Hamas cadres and wounded several others. Furthermore, the
      Zionist army has been sending reinforcements to vicinities of Palestinian
      cities in preparation for storming them amidst expectations of escalation
      and widening of the Zionist warfare launched by Sharon against our people
      and Nation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><u>We, in the Islamic
      Resistance Movement, Hamas, would like to clarify and affirm the
      following:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </u></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>First</b>: the Zionist
      military build up at entrances of cites and villages and threatening to
      storm them does not terrorize our people who vowed before Allah to
      maintain steadfastness, patience and resistance. The people’s Jihad
      forces are capable, with the grace and help of Allah, to confront and
      repel the Zionist aggression.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Second</b>: we call on
      our people in all cities, villages and refugee camps to get ready and
      unite their lines adopting all necessary measures to confront the Zionist
      threats and foil any attack.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Third</b>: the
      enemy’s monstrous crime in Bethlehem will not pass unpunished. Sharon
      and all Zionists will pay a dear price and the reprisal will be a painful
      one God willing.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Fourth</b>: our people
      are entitled to resisting the Zionist occupation and retaliate to its
      arrogance, massacres and aggressions. This is a legitimate right practiced
      by our people and Jihad factions in any place on the land of Palestine
      whether in the West Bank or Gaza Strip or the 1948 occupied areas. Faced
      by an enemy that is occupying our lands and launching a large-scale war
      against us, we are all entitled to retaliate with an open battle and
      comprehensive resistance.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Fifth</b>: terrorist
      Sharon, who has given his army and settlers a free hand to wreak havoc in
      our lands, killing, destroying and terrorizing, is claiming his abidance
      by the ceasefire and is spreading deceptive allegations in this regard in
      world platforms with US support. On the Palestinian level, our people are
      daily suffering Zionist aggressions, yet certain parties are advocating
      calming down the situation, condemning martyrdom operations and warning
      Jihad factions against launching any military operation in 1948 lands in
      addition to threatening a return to the policy of arrests and even did
      that on certain occasions!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Sixth</b>: we along
      with all our people’s factions affirm our absolute rejection of the
      policy of arresting the heroic Mujahideen, who are defending our people.
      We denounce the Palestinian Authority’s security bodies’ step of
      arresting two Hamas cadres in Qalqilya and trying to arrest others in
      Jenin. We call on the Authority and its security apparatuses to
      immediately release the detainees and refrain from resuming that policy,
      which is a big stab in the back of our national unity, at a time when our
      people are in dire need of mobilizing efforts and potentials in face of
      the Zionist aggression.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Seventh</b>: we
      fervently appeal to our Arab and Islamic Nation to back our Palestinian
      people’s steadfastness and resistance with all means possible. We urge
      the Arab leaders and officials in particular to hold an emergency summit
      meeting in which they would declare general mobilization and supply
      Palestinian resistance with money and arms. Talking about settlements and
      peace is a farce and a cover-up for Sharon’s aggressive policy, who is
      no longer waiting for any excuse to continue his terrorism and aggression
      against our Palestinian people and our Arab and Islamic Nation. It is
      about time today to end once and for all contacts with Zionists and their
      criminal symbols such as Peres, Omri Sharon and their likes.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><i>“And
      soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their affairs will
      take!”<o:p>
      </o:p>
