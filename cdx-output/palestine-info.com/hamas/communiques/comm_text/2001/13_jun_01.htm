      <p class="MsoTitle" align="center"><i>In the name of Allah the most
      Gracious the most Merciful</i></p>
      <p class="MsoSubtitle" align="center"><b><font color="#0000FF">Press
      statement on PA’s acceptance of George Tenet’s proposals</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Commenting on the
      Palestinian Authority’s acceptance of the American Central Intelligence
      Agency (CIA) chief George Tenet’s proposals, even with certain
      reservations, a responsible source in the Islamic Resistance Movement,
      Hamas, said that the Movement would like to affirm the following stands:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- Based on the
      Movement’s previous declaration along with all Palestinian forces and
      factions on rejecting American and western pressures and initiatives, we
      reject the PA’s acceptance of the CIA chief’s proposals, which are in
      fact Israeli proposals in American guise. We affirm that the PA’s
      approval came in response to feverish American and western pressures over
      the past few days and not in response to the Palestinian national position
      that was reflected in the popular and factional unanimity today on
      continuation of the intifada and resistance. Consequently we ask the PA to
      rescind its stand towards those proposals and side by our people’s
      stands, rights.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- The American and
      western moves, especially the recent George Tenet’s efforts, were not
      active over the past eight months to stop Palestinian blood letting
      including hundreds of martyrs and thousands of wounded or to halt
      destruction of houses and agricultural fields in addition other sabotage
      acts. They only acted when Sharon failed to restore Zionist security and
      quell our people’s intifada, resistance and heroic operations, which had
      almost led to real changes in the Zionist entity’s situation. Tenet’s
      proposals and the western-American proposals were meant to save the
      Zionist entity from its ordeal in addition to saving mass murderer Sharon
      from his predicament. They do not care for our people’s rights and
      sufferings; they even ignore and bypass them.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- Mitchell’s report,
      the American proposals and all political initiatives in the region
      blatantly ignore the core of the conflict and deal with the Palestinian
      people’s cause and rights in accordance with wrong and oppressive
      equations, which we denounce. Once they call for reciprocal end of
      violence as if the clashes were between two neighboring and equal parties
      rather than an occupation and oppressive aggression against an unarmed
      people. On another occasion, they call for halting the construction of
      settlements in return for ending the intifada and resistance, which is the
      essence of Mitchell’s report, in a way downgrading our people’s
      demands of expelling occupation into merely ending settlement activity
      while endorsing occupation and its hegemony.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The American proposals
      then follow dealing with the issue from security point of view for the
      interest of the Zionist enemy and its priorities without any
      considerations to our people’s rights and just demands. They impose on
      the PA certain security prerequisites that would lead in conclusion,
      according to the American-Zionist speculation, to Palestinian feudal
      fighting, halting the intifada and resistance and aborting their
      accomplishments.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">This means that the
      political moves target more concessions and political retreat, which were
      originally oppressive and unfair and were rejected on our part and on the
      part of our people, so how would the situation be with such bias and
      quickening downfall.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">4- We, in the Hamas Movement along with our
      people’s masses and forces, affirm that the intifada will continue and
      the resistance will persist. We declare our absolute rejection to the
      return to security coordination and cooperation with the enemy, the policy
      of arrests and prosecution of Mujahideen and disarming them. This will
      entail a most serious impact on our people’s national unity, interests,
      rights and accomplishments of their intifada and resistance. They do not
      serve anyone on the Palestinian arena not even in the PA. Our people will
      not allow the return to such policies and measures and will remain
      insisting on their right in resisting occupation.</p>
