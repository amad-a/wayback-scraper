      <h3 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#FF0000">Press
      statement by Hamas concerning the<br>
      Stockholm Conference on the alleged Holocaust of the Jews</font><o:p>

      </font></h3>
      <p style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><font face="Times New Roman">In
      the Name of God, the Merciful, the Mercy-giving.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <br>
      Commenting on the international conference in Stockholm on the alleged
      Holocaust of the Jews during the Second World War, a responsible source in
      the Islamic Resistance Movement - Hamas - made the following statement:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <br>
      The convening of this conference clearly serves the Zionist aim of
      falsifying history and obscuring the truth that the so-called Holocaust is
      nothing but a baseless, fictitious claim. This malicious conference seeks
      to reinforce a guilt complex vis-à-vis the Jews in Europe in general and
      in Germany in particular, to facilitate the continued fleecing of the
      world in support of the Zionist entity's expansionism and aggression.
      Creating great fantasies about an alleged "crime" that never
      happened while ignoring the millions of Europeans who died or suffered at
      the hands of the Nazis during the Second World War clearly exposes the
      face of racist Zionism with its belief in the superiority of the Jewish
      race over all other peoples.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><font face="Times New Roman">The
      attempt to rouse concern over a baseless, fictitious story while
      overlooking the sufferings of our people, ignoring Zionist massacres such
      as Deir Yasin, Kufr Qasim, Tantoura, Jerusalem, the Ibrahimi Mosque, and
      Sabra and Shatila, not to mention the enemy's massacres of our Arab people
      in Bahr al-Baqar, and Qana, and the killing of thousands of Egyptian
      prisoners of war, etc., all of this confirms that many western states
      still are deluded by erroneous Zionist propaganda. As a result, their
      positions lack credibility and justice as regards our cause and our people
      and their on-going suffering. This will never lead to stability in the
      Middle East region, nor will it obscure the fact that the Zionist entity
      was built upon racial discrimination, terrorism and repression.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><font face="Times New Roman">By
      means of the Stockholm conference and the tale of the Nazi Holocaust, the
      Zionist entity practices psychological and intellectual terrorism.
      Meanwhile, in Palestine and Lebanon, it practices the bloody terrorism of
      which it accuses other peoples. We call upon the countries that took part
      in this conference to review their positions and not to submit to Zionist
      haughtiness or to its continued plunder. We call on free-minded thinkers
      and writers and the vital forces of the world to work to uncover the
      crimes of world Zionism against our people, our nation, and against
      humanity as a whole, to expose them and not to fear the assault of the
      Jews, their intellectual terrorism, and their efforts to stifle voices and
      keep fair thinkers and researchers from exposing the claims and lies of
      Zionism. For the Jews in the world oppose the scientific method of study
      and research whenever it contradicts their racist interests<o:p>
