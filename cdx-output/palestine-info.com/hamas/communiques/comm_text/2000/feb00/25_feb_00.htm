      its army and citizenry after the painful blows inflicted on them by our
      people’s heroic Mujahideen, and after the series of defeats that the
      heroic Islamic resistance has inflicted upon the Zionists in south
      Lebanon, the Occupation Authorities have announced that they are carrying
      out a campaign of arrests, picking up dozens of Mujahideen members of the
      Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades who have carried out numerous armed
      operations in recent months, and&nbsp; who, the Zionist authorities
      believe, planned to blow up a large residential building.<o:p>

      the importance of these arrests, presenting them as a great achievement,
      will not benefit the Zionist enemy . It will not raise their sunken
      morale. These arrests are no different from other such campaigns that take
      place from time to time and to which our people have grown accustomed in
      the course of their open and continuing struggle against the rapacious
      Zionist enemy.&nbsp; The Mujahideen have always shown that they are
      stronger than all forms of repression and tyranny, stronger than the waves
      of arrests.&nbsp; No such attempts will be able to divert them from their
      course or shake their resolve to wage a holy struggle and resistance in<o:p>

      children, that the Zionist enemy’s foreign minister made – threats
      that were affirmed and supported by the terrorist Prime Minister Ehud
      Barak – show clearly the breakdown and collapse that the Zionist entity
      and its military staff are experiencing as a result of the defeats they
      have sustained at the hands of the brave Islamic resistance in south
      Lebanon.&nbsp; The hysterical terrorist threats against Lebanon and the
      exaggeration of the achievements of its arrest campaign against heroic
      Palestinian Mujahideen also expose the Zionists’ need to search for
      victories, even if they be imaginary victories, to hide their own
      impotence and to raise the morale of their people and their defeated army.<o:p>

      will remain the firm policy of the Hamas movement and of all sincere
      members of our people.&nbsp; All the campaigns of repression and arrest
      will only increase the determination and resolve of our people and our
      heroes to continue the holy struggle, to attain martyrdom in defense of
      our land, our Jerusalem, our holy places, and for the liberation of our
