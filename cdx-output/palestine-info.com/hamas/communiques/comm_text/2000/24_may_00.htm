      Congratulations to Lebanon and its brave resistance for their great
      victory<o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText" dir="LTR">The Lebanese people along with the Arab
      and Islamic Nation these days celebrate the resistance’s victory over
      the enemy’s army and its quislings in South Lebanon. Here it is, the
      Zionist enemy, running away from South Lebanon humiliated, panicked and
      defeated. And here it is the army of agent Lahd collapsing and vanishing
      completely after the brave Islamic and nationalist Lebanese resistance
      turned its life, along with that of the occupation, into unbearable hell
      thanks to heroism and daring operations of the Mujahideen.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" dir="LTR">Lebanon, on the official and popular
      levels, has adopted and supported the resistance with all its trends,
      sects and strength. It extended support and backing, it was patient and
      bore the repercussions, blood … pain … tears, and here it is now
      reaping the fruit of its patience, Jihad and stands.<b><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" dir="LTR"><b><font color="#0000FF">Our Arab and
      Islamic Nation :</font><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" dir="LTR">The victories of our people in Lebanon
      against the Zionist enemy affirm beyond any doubt that Jihad, resistance,
      blood and sacrifices extract rights. Victory is not granted nor begged.
      The Lebanese victory emphasizes that the Zionist enemy only understands
      the language of force and arms and only kneels before steadfast men. The
      Palestinian people should be fully aware of that lesson and to resume,
      with its guidance, their Jihad and resistance.<b><o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText" dir="LTR"><b><font color="#0000FF">Our Palestinian

      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" dir="LTR">It is really painful that at the time
      when the Lebanese people and government affirm their cohesion and support
      to the resistance and achieve their wonderful victories, the Palestinian
      Authority, on behalf of the occupation, pursues the Mujahideen to arrest
      them. It also confronts our angry masses and prevents them from engaging
      the occupation soldiers. The PA is also seeking to abort the latest
      Palestinian detainees’ Intifadha.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" dir="LTR">The PA thought that through such
      practices it would please the occupiers and facilitate its humiliating
      negotiations with them while Barak’s arrogance was increasing along with
      his conditions and dictates on the PA, which finally gives up because it
      lost all pressure and power cards and stood before the Zionist enemy
      completely paralyzed and submissive.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText" dir="LTR"><b>We, in the Islamic Resistance

      people congratulate the brotherly Lebanese people, government and brave
      resistance topped by the heroes the Mujahideen of Hizbullah over their
      great victory and for liberating their lands and forcing out the invading
      occupiers. We also congratulate Syria and Iran and all those who backed
      the resistance. Congratulations to our Palestinian people and to our Arab

      ahead along the road of Jihad and resistance insisting on our right to all
      of our lands regardless of the length of that road or its dear sacrifices
      and no matter how arrogant was the Zionist enemy.</p>
