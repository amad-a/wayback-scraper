      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      village Mahmoud Abdullah at the hands of the Zionist occupation soldiers,
      a responsible source in the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, said:</u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">A group of Zionist undercover soldiers, specialized in pursuing and
      assassinating Palestinian Muhajideen, has murdered the mayor of Sarda
      village in the Ramallah district. The occupation authority claimed that
      the unit was looking for one of the Hamas Movement’s Mujahideen and
      started shooting killing the mayor of that village Mahmoud Abdullah, 73,
      who was standing on the rooftop of his house.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The occupation authority alleged that the martyr had fired at the
      soldiers. It was not requited with murdering him but also arrested his
      sons, one of whom is a correspondent for the French news agency (AFP) who
      was charged of belonging to Hizbullah. They were later released in a bid
      to justify and cover up the crime.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The fact is that the martyr’s house was the target of repeated stealing
      attempts last year. At dawn today, he heard sounds outside his house so he
      went to the roof to discover the cause of such noise and immediately the
      undercover soldiers shot him.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The occupation authority issued perplexed statements to explain what
      happened; it accused the martyr of firing first and later said that the
      soldiers thought he was a Hamas cadre, as if the Hamas cadres’ blood was
      permanently wasted. It then claimed that one of his sons was a member in
      Hizbullah but all those attempts could not conceal the abhorred crime.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The occupation authority’s crime reflected the occupation’s real ugly
      face and its aggressive and repressive practices against our unarmed
      people. It also exposed reality of that criminal enemy with which the
      Palestinian Authority was trying to make peace at the expense of our
      people’s blood and our rights and sanctities.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">It is regrettable that the Zionist crime had coincided with the official
      declaration of the resumption of negotiations between the PA and the
      arrogant Zionist enemy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">We demand the PA to halt is absurd negotiations with the occupation
      authority and to respect the will of our Palestinian people, who reject
      such negotiations and insist on their rights, Quds and holy shrines. We
      urge the PA to respect the blood of our people, including that of martyr
      Mahmoud Abdullah that would not be the last to be shed, and to halt all
      forms of security coordination with the enemy aimed at pursuing and
      liquidating the Mujahideen.<b><o:p>
