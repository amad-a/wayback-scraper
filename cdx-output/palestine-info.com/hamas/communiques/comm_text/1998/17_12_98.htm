    <td width="100%"><b></b><p align="CENTER"><b><font color="#FF0000">Condemnation alone is not

    enough…</font></b></p>

    <i><b></b></i><p align="CENTER"><i><b>Giving up secondary differences and breaking the siege imposed on

    the Iraqi People should be the Arab reaction to the American brute aggression</b></i></p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">After his failure to invest his recent tour in Occupied Palestine in

    covering his disgraceful scandals, the head of the U.S. "Zionized"

    Administration decided to launch cowardly raids on the Iraqi People and their children by

    using long-range missiles and air bombers. He justified his aggression by claiming that he

    wanted to protect the United Nations Security Council resolutions, although the Council

    was not consulted prior to the American aggression that was made in collusion with the

    United Kingdom.</p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">The U.S. President had failed to exert any pressure on Netanyahu to

    force him into implementing the Wye River memorandum. Therefore, he rushed to cover up

    this failure and the humiliation he received from Netanyahu, as well as to disguise his

    fear of a likely Congress vote to oust him from his post, by shelling and bombing the

    Iraqi People.</p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">This infamous crime that has been perpetrated by Clinton shows the real

    and ugly face of both him and his "Zionized" Administration. It also blatantly

    exposes how trifle and ridiculous are those who tried to market the false friendship of

    Clinton and the Americans among our Palestinian People, as well as those who applauded for

    him for a long time while they were slaughtering the Palestinian National Charter and the

    legitimate rights of our People.</p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">We strongly condemn this cowardly and perfidious aggression. It is a

    serious threat to the Arab and Islamic security. It is a stupid decision made by a corrupt

    President, who is subservient to a lobby that is full of hatred against humanity. It is a

    decision that only serves Zionist goals and opens the door for attempts to partition an

    Arab State and an important regional power, which eventually makes the security of the

    region and the future of the Nation exposed to storms.</p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">The perfidious aggression on the Iraqi People does not aim to defend

    the security of the Gulf States as alleged by Clinton, who is facing a vote that will

    force him to resign after he lied to his people. The massacres that are being carried out

    against the Iraqi people and their children are just a bloody bill paid by the Arab Nation

    for the cost of Clinton’s mistakes and misconduct and of his submission to the

    Zionist blackmailers.</p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">We, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), consider the criminal

    aggression against Iraq as a violation of all international laws, conventions and values.

    It shows how the White House Administration could care less about the Arab Nation, its

    values and feelings of its people. This requires an urgent Arab and Islamic decisive move

    to put an end to these crimes and atrocities against a dear part of this Nation, of whose

    people are being destroyed by an Administration that lacks in will and by bribed

    inspection committees which have connections with the Zionist State.</p>

    <p>We call for an urgent Arab summit to discuss the tragedy of the Iraqi People and to

    take a serious and responsible position in which the Arab States put aside their secondary

    differences and disputes, which will also pave the road for the restoration of Arab

    solidarity, as a prelude to lift the infamous siege imposed on the Arab people of Iraq,

    Libya and Sudan. The Arab summit should put an end to the continuous American atrocities

    and abuses of the human rights of the Arabs everywhere and at all levels.</p>
