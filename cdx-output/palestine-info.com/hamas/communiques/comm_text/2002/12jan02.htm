      <p class="MsoTitle" align="center"><i>In the name of Allah the most
      Gracious the most Merciful</i><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>Zionist
      crime in Rafah will not go unpunished<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>Palestinian
      smuggling of arms does not justify this crime<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b>&nbsp;</b>The Zionist occupiers have
      committed a new savage crime that could be only carried out by people
      stripped of all human values at a time when the world is claiming to be at
      war with terrorism. The Zionists demolished 73 houses and displaced 150
      families in Rafah justifying their crime by saying it was to prevent
      Palestinians from smuggling arms and in retaliation to the Palestinian
      attempt to smuggle a shipload of arms.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We condemn this blind
      terrorism and affirm the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1-This cruel terrorist act
      would not go unpunished and we affirm our full right in defending and
      protecting our people in face of Zionist terrorism <b><i>“And soon will
      the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their affairs will take!”<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </i></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2-We ask the Arab
      governments and peoples to strengthen our people’s steadfastness through
      compensating any damage inflicted as a result of occupation practices. We
      appeal to the Arab League secretary general Mr. Amre Mousa to initiate
      steps to actualize this measure so as to foil the Zionist schemes aimed at
      forcing the immigration of our people through exercising various forms of
      pressures on them.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3-We denounce the American
      support of Zionist terrorism as voiced by secretary of state Collin Powell
      when he told reporters, “Israel was retaliating to the arms smuggling
      incident”. He added “the large part of the military operations in the
      past 24 hours was meant to destroy means of smuggling arms via south of
      Gaza Strip” then opined “it is a defensive measure”. We ask the
      Palestinian Authority not to depend much on America as an honest mediator.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">4-We affirm our people’s full rights in resisting
      occupation and their right of acquiring arms to confront and eject Zionist
      occupation. The Zionist enemy is spending billions each year for the sake
      of accumulating the most advanced weapons to impose its occupation by
      force.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">5-The PA’s embarrassment
      due to the shipload of arms was not due to the fact that our Palestinian
      people did not have the right to acquire arms for the sake of resisting
      occupation but due to Oslo, which stripped the Palestinian people from
      this right along with several other legitimate rights. Consequently, we
      request the PA to rescind Oslo and return to the Palestinian people’s
      option namely resistance.<o:p>
