      Open Message from&nbsp;<br>
      Khaled Mishaal to the Jordanian Monarch<br>

      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%;

10.0pt">Your Majesty, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, did not change in
      a matter of few months and cannot change in years. The Hamas Movement that
      your father the late King Hussein, may Allah have mercy on his soul, knew
      quite well; is the same Hamas that is present today in Jordan. The late
      King knew Hamas and embraced a number of its leaders, hosted Dr. Abu
      Marzouq from his prison in America and received the Mujahid Sheikh Ahmed
      Yassin. He also adopted a manly stand, full of gallantry, firmness and
      wisdom, in resisting the Mossad agents on the land of dear Jordan and
      insisted on providing the antidote. This Hamas Movement did not change, so
      why is there a change in the stance towards it? What has changed? Mohammed
      Abu Seif, who repelled the Mossad agents’ attack against Jordan’s
      sovereignty and security and who was honoured a year ago by the Interior
      Minister, what has changed so that he would be in prison today?</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">Hamas did not change but regrettably stands towards it have changed. We
      hope that your Majesty would return things to normalcy. We also say to the
      Jordanian government and to all security and judicial apparatuses that
      those pressures on Hamas and those charges are not true and unjustifiable.
      It is not appropriate that Hamas would be prosecuted for the sake of
      non-Jordanian interests. This does not fall in line with dear Jordan’s
      interest nor that of the Ummah. We say to the dear Jordanian people, who
      stood in support of us with its northern, central and southern areas, with
      its tribes and (refugee) camps, with all political trends, with all its
      parties, syndicates and nationalist and Islamic figures, we tell them that
      Hamas will remain loyal to its pledge and that Jordan’s security and
      sovereignty will remain our concern and will remain untouchable.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">Hamas will never target anyone from the Ummah and will never change its
      policy especially in dear Jordan. The Movement’s pendulum will remain
      directed against the Zionist enemy. I say to those who think that
      pressures on Hamas along with harassment measures would lead to its
      deviation from its path and political belief, I tell them that they are
      wrong. No-one, insha’allah, will ever succeed in eliminating Hamas in
      this sensitive stage when the Palestine cause is passing through the most
      dangerous attempt for its liquidation under the pretext of final status
      talks. Hamas is not a thing that can be eliminated in a certain stage. We
      are going back to Jordan, and we say to all Hamas lovers and those afraid
      on its behalf, do not be afraid for there are loyal Hamas leaders and
      cadres within the occupied homeland and outside it. So, if some of Hamas
      leaders were absent or absented for one reason or another, the march of
      Hamas will persist by the will of Allah.</span></p>
