    5 June 1999</em></strong></u></font></p>

    <b><i></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#FF0000">In commemoration of the 32<sup>nd</sup>

    anniversary of June 1967 Defeat</font></i></p>

    <u></u></b><h3 align="CENTER"><b><u></u><font color="#FF0000">Latent elements of victory waiting to be

    stirred</font></b></h3>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">The 32<sup>nd</sup> anniversary of the 5 June 1967 defeat has come at a

    time when the Arab Nation is still overwhelmed with the psychological defeat caused by the

    peace process that has been signed now for several years. The anniversary, which was

    ignored by the media, re-focuses the light on the reasons for the defeat, which cannot be

    forgotten by our Nation, and on the potential elements of the victory waiting to be

    stirred.</p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">The Arab Nation was defeated in 1967 because it did not possess the

    will of victory. Instead, their disability was concealed behind rhetoric and enthusiastic

    speeches. Although the results of this defeat were in the military field, its reasons were

    internal and referred to the deteriorating Arab political situation.</p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, after 32 years of this route, some Arabs still believe

    in co-existence with the Enemy, alleging they can convince it to abandon part of our

    occupied land. In the meantime, they do not give enough attention to strengthening the

    Arab ranks or to building the Arab power in order to force the occupation troops to

    withdraw from the Palestinian and Arab occupied lands. The practical outcome of this

    attitude is the feeble peace agreements which deepen the roots of the Zionist occupation

    after they recognized the Zionist usurpation of the majority of the Palestinian occupied

    land. It was a defeat of will in confrontation with the usurping enemy. Moreover, the

    Palestinian Authority accepted to play a part of the oppressive role of the Occupation

    against our people, believing this would convince the Zionists to introduce feeble

    relinquishments here and there!</p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">The reasons for the June 1967 defeat still exist in the Arab Nation.

    But the Nation has not remained in the same condition since that date. It witnessed

    attempts to get rid of the consequences of this defeat and to confront and resist the

    Zionist Occupation by all means possible.</p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">The great intifadah (uprising) triggered by the Palestinian People and

    their resistance and Jihad led by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) on the one hand,

    and the resistance of the occupation by the Lebanese People, especially the Hizbullah and

    the Lebanese Resistance on the other hand, are the most significant embodiment of the

    steadfast will and challenge which has never been shaken in the Arab People although it is

    weak at the Arab official level. The coming of this anniversary a few days after the

    escape of the Occupation troops and their agents from Jizzin area, south of Lebanon, is a

    good example to compare between the two cases.</p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">The anniversary of the defeat carrying all these pains and misfortunes

    should be taken as an opportunity to learn from these lessons in order to achieve a

    comprehensive renaissance, including the people and the rulers alike. This renaissance

    should be based on the Arab and Islamic solidarity and on confronting the force with a

    similar force. We should use all means possible and available to confront the challenge

    posed by the Zionist Enemy, which tries to expand its rule in our region under the cover

    of peace and normalization. </p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">While Hamas reminds the Palestinian People and the Nation of the

    necessity to learn from the lessons of the June 1967 defeat, it vows to continue its Jihad

    and resistance of the Occupation, and to abide by and defend the legitimate rights of our

    People and Nation. In this course, Hamas is supported by the Almighty Allah and by the

    Palestinian, Arab and Muslim people. It asserts that the victory’s exultation

    experienced by our Enemy will not be long. The eventual victory is, God willing, for this

    people and for this Nation, by our faith and by the arms of our heroes, as well as by the

    unity and solidarity of our Nation.</p>
