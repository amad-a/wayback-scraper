    <td width="100%"><p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF"><u><strong><em>&nbsp;18 May 1999</em></strong></u></font></p>

    <b></b><h3 align="CENTER"><b><font color="#FF0000">A new terrorist assumes power in the Zionist

    State</font></b></h3>

    <p align="LEFT">Electorates in the Zionist entity wrapped up a page in their political

    life and opened a new one with a new professional terrorist leader, who has exerted all

    efforts over many decades to chase, assassinate, or arrest our people and their leaders in

    and out of Palestine.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">The victory of the terrorist Ehud Barak has never and will never change

    anything concerning the nature of the Zionist project which is based on expansion,

    hegemony, and oppression. This was asserted by Barak more than once during his election

    campaign which marketed a platform similar to the Likud’s without any political

    differences. This platform does not change the hostile and aggressive nature of the

    Zionist society against our people and nation.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">A view of Barak’s electoral campaign, which concentrated on his role

    in the wars against the Arab States, the Palestinian Resistance, and against our people,

    proves that the Zionist General has assumed power in the Zionist State based on his

    military history and his platform which in turn is based on extremism and arrogance. This

    proves more that the Zionist Society is inclining more and more towards extremism.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">Barak’s success as Prime Minister in the Zionist State should not

    lead some to show too much optimism. It is true that there are some differences between

    him and Netanyahu in manner and tactics, but they have identical objectives and

    perspectives. Moreover, Barak stands on the far right of the Labour Party and he is an

    extremist hawk. His hands are stained with Palestinian blood. The platform he adopted

    concerning the Palestinian track was very clear. In his first speech he delivered after

    his winning, he asserted that the united Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Zionist

    State. He also declared that the Occupation troops will never go back to the 1967 borders

    and that he will never allow the presence of any Arab army west of the Jordan River. He

    said that he would not dismantle the Jewish settlements, which will be kept under Zionist

    control. As for the Palestinian State, Barak and his Party reject a full supremacy of the

    State and reject our people’s right of return. Barak, on whom the Palestinian

    Authority pins its hopes, had rejected the Oslo accords few years ago.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">Therefore, there are no essential differences between Barak’s and

    Netanyahu’s positions regarding the basic issues that will be negotiated in the final

    status talks (the State, Jerusalem, the refugees and the Jewish settlements). This proves

    again that the failure of the peace process was not because of the arrogance and the

    hard-line policy of the defeated terrorist Netanyahu but because of the nature of the

    Zionist project and its real objectives which have not changed in essence but only in the

    means and tactics.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">Relying on Barak’s victory and cheering for his coming reflect the

    utmost disability and the desire to mislead our people. The reality that all of us should

    be aware of is that Barak’s advent imposes a big challenge on our people and nation.

    It is the same challenge of that with the Zionist project but in a new way and tactic. The

    snake does not change its nature when it changes its skin. Therefore, the battle is still

    ongoing and the war has not ceased as yet. Our rights should be extracted, not waited for.

    They need more work, Jihad and resistance.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">The Labour Party has come back to power carrying a long history of

    aggression, oppression and terrorism, not to mention Rabin’s policy of breaking our

    people’s bones or the Qana massacre perpetrated by the infamous terrorist Peres. Our

    people are well-aware that their salvation will never be in the hands of their new enemy,

    Barak, who boasts of receiving many medals for his role in the wars against the Arab

    people and in the special terrorist operations he carried out against the Palestinian

    Resistance and Palestinian leaders.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">While we, in Hamas, warn from rushing towards the Zionist Enemy and the

    normalization of ties with it at the expense of the security and rights of our people, we

    reiterate that our people will not rely on empty promises and that they will continue in

    the resistance option until they are liberated and their rights are restored by the will

    of our Almighty God.</p>
