    <td width="100%"><p align="left"><u><font size="3" color="#0000FF"><strong><em>

    5 May 1999</em></strong></font></u></p>

    <b><font size="3"></font><h3 align="CENTER"><font size="3"></font><font size="4"><font color="#FF0000">The

    Zionist Enemy continues campaign <br>

    of settlement and Judaization;<br>

    The Palestinian Authority arrests the nobles</font></font></h3><font size="4">

    </font></b><p align="LEFT">The Zionist Enemy continues its arbitrary measures against our

    People. These measures have escalated during the election campaign to appease the Zionist

    electorate. The conspiracy to Judaize occupied Jerusalem also continues through the

    demolition of Palestinian homes and the annexation of vast areas of the Bethlehem

    Municipality’s land to occupied Jerusalem in order to expand its borders and to seize

    more of our 1967-occupied territories as part of the Jewish State.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">The herds of Jewish settlers also continue on a daily basis in their

    attempt to Judaize the Palestinian usurped land and to seize more of our People’s

    land. All this is continuously done publicly, without any Arab, Muslim or international

    counter-move to put an end to these atrocities. </p>

    <p align="LEFT">All of the above is happening while the Palestinian Authority (PA) insists

    on abiding by its fragile agreements with the Zionist Enemy. The PA also submits to the

    Zionist dictates and threats, continuing its oppressive measures against our noble people

    who oppose its policies and rejects its submission to the Zionist arrogance.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">The PA has re-arrested members and supporters of the Islamic Resistance

    Movement (Hamas) shortly after their release. This means that our People are subject to

    the moody decisions of the PA. They have become cards and tactical messages in the hands

    of the PA, using them according to its needs and objectives without giving any attention

    to the dignity, freedom and rights of our People.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">Hamas condemns the PA’s unchanged manner against our people, which

    aims to busy them with internal disputes and problems and which endangers our national

    unity. Meanwhile, it leaves the Zionist Enemy free to swallow more land and continue

    settlements throughout the Palestinian territories.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">We call again upon the PA to stop traveling along this dawdling Oslo track

    and to side with its People, their concerns, and their sincere <i>Jihadi</i> forces who

    confront the Enemy’s plots. We also call upon it to resist the Enemy’s

    expansionist projects in order to rescue our land and holy places.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">We also call upon the Arab and Islamic States to take practical steps to

    support our People and strengthen their resistance of the settlement and Judaization

    campaigns.</p>

    <p align="LEFT">We appeal to all ranks of our Palestinian People to resist the settlement

    and Judaization campaigns with all means possible. We give a covenant to our People to

    remain in the trenches confronting the occupation Enemy, and to continue resistance of the

    occupation, settlement and Judaization activities. We also vow that Hamas will stand by

    all <i>Mujahideen</i> and honest people as an impenetrable and insurmountable barrier

    protecting our land and holy places.</p>
