Shi'ite Anthology </a>By <font color="#CC66CC">Allamah M. H. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Spa/7220/tab.html">Tabatabai</a>.</font></font></b></center>

<p align="justify">The word "<font color="#FF0000">imam</font>" in Arabic means "<font color="#3333FF">leader</font>".
In Islamic terminology it generally refers to any person who leads others
in prayer. According to the early Sunni theologians, the Imam is the leader
of the Islamic community, and his function is to enforce the revealed Law
or Shari'ah. As such the term is equivalent to "<font color="#009900">caliph</font>".
In Sunnism it may also be an honorific term, given to certain important
religious leaders, such as Imam Shafi'i, founder of one of the four Sunni
schools of law. In <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Spa/7220/12.html">Twelve-Imam</a>
Shi'ism it has two important meanings. As in Sunnism, the leader of others
in prayer is called an "<font color="#006600">imam</font>", especially
the person who performs this function on a regular basis in a mosque. But
more specifically, an Imam is one of the twelve successors of the Prophet
listed below.

</p><p align="justify">The specific meaning given to the word "<font color="#000099">imam</font>"
in Shi'ism can not be understood until one grasps the basic difference
between the Sunni and Shi'ite branches of Islam. The roots of this difference
are to be found in the differing views held by the companions of the Prophet
concerning the nature of his successor or caliph. The Prophet himself performed
three basic functions: He acted as the means whereby a celestial book,
the Quran, was revealed by God to mankind. Thus he was the founder of a
world religion. He was also the ruler of the early Islamic community, which
means that he enforced the Shari'ah which God had revealed through the
Quran. Finally he was the possessor of spiritual illumination and vision,
and as such he could interpret the inner meaning of the Revelation and
guide men upon the ascending stages of the path of spiritual perfection.

</p><p align="justify">According to the majority of Muslims, the Sunnis, the successor of the
Prophet must fulfill only one of these functions, i.e., he should enforce
the Shari'ah.  <b><a href="http://www.geocities.com.tokyo/Spa/7220/masoom.html">Muhammad</a> </b>
(s) had been <b><font color="#000000">the last Prophet</font></b>, so there
could be no prophet after him. And there was no way the community could
guarantee that his successors would possess spiritual vision and illumination,
for like prophecy, these things are divinely bestowed (although unlike
prophecy, they could still be possessed by men). But undoubtedly, the Prophet's
successor could act as a ruler and enforce the Shari'ah. In fact, the earthly
existence of Islam largely depended upon this function being fulfilled,
particularly at its beginning. Finally, the Sunnis held that the Prophet
had not appointed a successor during his lifetime, so it was up to them
to choose one.

</p><p align="justify">But the minority group, known as the "<b><font color="#3333FF">Shi'ites</font></b>"
(<font color="#000000">the "partisans" of 'Ali</font>), maintained that
the Prophet's successor must not only enforce the Shari'ah, he must also
possess divinely illuminated wisdom and be the spiritual guide of men.
Since this latter function is bestowed by God and cannot be judged by the
majority of men, the Prophet's successor must be divinely appointed, as
expressed in the Prophet's wishes. And the Shi'ites hold that the Prophet
had in fact appointed 'Ali as his caliph.<a name="n2"></a><a href="#r2">[2]</a>

</p><p align="justify">This difference in view between the <b><a href="http://www.al-islam.org/encyclopedia">Shi'ites
and Sunnis</a></b> was often expressed in political terms, resulting in
a good deal of strife in the early centuries of Islam between certain Shi'ite
groups and the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphs. For, as far as the Shi'ites
were concerned, the Imams were the only completely legitimate successors
to the Prophet. The first, 'Ali, was appointed by the Prophet himself,
and each in turn was appointed by his predecessor according to divine decree.

</p><p><font color="#FF0000"><font size="+2"><b>Fatimah</b> <b>al-Zahra</b></font></font>

</p><p align="justify"><b><font color="#006600">The beloved daughter of the Prophet from Khadijah</font></b>,
<b><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Spa/7220/fatima.html">Fatimah</a></b>
was born in Mecca five years before the beginning of the Prophet's mission.
She was so loved by the Prophet that he called her "<b><font color="#660000">a
part of me</font></b>." In 2/624 <b><font color="#666600">she married 'Ali
ibn Abi Talib</font></b> from whom she bore three sons, Hasan, Husayn and
Muhsin (who died stillborn), and two daughters, Zaynab and Urnm Kulthum.
She was at the Prophet's bedside at the moment of his death and fought
for her husband's succession to the caliphate. She died six months after
her father in the year II/633 and is buried in the Baq'i cemetery in Medina.
It is said that when she was born the whole sky became illuminated; therefore
she is called<b><font color="#000000"> <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Spa/7220/zahra.html">al-Zahra</a>
the "Radiant."</font></b> She is the mother of the Shi'ite Imams and is
considered the most holy of Muslim women.

</p><p><b><font color="#FF9900"><font size="+2">The Twelve Imams</font></font></b>

</p><p>I.<b> <font color="#009900">The First Imam, 'Ali al-Murtada </font></b>
(b. A.D. 600, d. A.H. 40/A.D. 661)

</p><p align="justify">He was the son of the Prophet's paternal uncle, <b><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Spa/7220/abutalib2.html">Abu
Talib</a></b>, who had raised the Prophet like his own son and protected
him after he declared his mission. According to the Shi'ites, <b><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Spa/7220/ali.html">'Ali</a></b>
was the first to accept the new religion at the hands of the Prophet, at
the age of ten. He was the greatest warrior of early Islam, and according
to his partisans was appointed by the Prophet as his successor at a place
known as ''<b><font color="#000099"><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Spa/7220/ghadir.html">Ghadir
al-Khumm</a></font></b>". He became the fourth Sunni caliph, the last of
the "Rightly-Guided Caliphs", after the death of 'Uthman. He was finally
assassinated by followers of the Khawarij (an early schismatic sect), after
five years as caliph. He is buried in Najaf in Iraq. [Read: <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/nahjul/index.htm">Nahjul-Balaghah</a>
]

</p><p>II.<b> <font color="#3366FF">The Second Imam, al-Hasan al-Mujtaba</font></b>
(3/62 -50/670)

</p><p align="justify">He was the elder son of 'Ali by the Prophet's daughter Fatimah. He laid
claim to the caliphate for some six months after the death of his father,
but was finally forced to surrender it to Mu'awiyah. For the rest of his
life he lived in Medina in seclusion. He is buried in the <b><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Spa/7220/baqi.html">Baq'i</a></b>
cemetery in Medina.

</p><p>III.<b> <font color="#FF0000">The Third Imam, al-Husayn Sayyed al-Shuhada</font></b>
(4/62 -6I/680)

</p><p align="justify">The younger son of 'Ali by Fatimah, like his brother he lived most of
his life quietly in Medina under the watchful eyes of the caliph's officials
and spies. When Mu'awiyah's son Yazid became caliph, he demanded allegiance
from <b><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Spa/7220/husain.html">al-Husayn</a></b>,
who refused to give it. Finally <b><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Spa/7220/husain2.html">al-Husayn</a></b>
felt it necessary to go into battle against Yazid to protest against the
injustices which were being carried out in the name of Islam. He and a
small group of followers including most of his immediate family were cruelly
massacred at Karbala The day of his martyrdom ("'<b><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Spa/7220/ashura.html">Ashura</a></b>")
has become the most solemn day of the Shi'ite calendar, marked by processions
and universal mourning. Its celebration symbolizes the whole ethos of Shi'ism.
He is buried in Karbala in Iraq.

</p><p><b>IV. <font color="#993366">The Fourth Imam, 'Ali  Zayn al-'Abidin,
al-Sajjad</font></b> (38/65895/7I2)

</p><p align="justify">The son of Imam al-Husayn by the daughter of Yazdigird, the last Sassanid
king of Iran, he was not able to carry arms at Karbala because of illness,
and thus he was saved the fate of his three brothers. For most of his life
he lived in seclusion in Medina, having contact with only a few select
followers. His piety-which is reflected in his collected prayers,<b> </b>
<b><a href="http://www.al-islam.org/sahifa/">al-Sahifah al-Sajjadiyyah</a></b> <b>
</b>is proverbial. He is buried in the Baqi' cemetery in Medina.

</p><p><b>V. <font color="#CC66CC">The Fifth Imam, Muhammad al-Baqir</font></b>
(57/675II4/732)

</p><p align="justify">The son of the fourth Imam, he was present at Karbala at a young age.
Because of changing political and religious conditions, among them the
general revulsion following the events at Karbala, many people came to
Medina to learn the religious and spiritual sciences from him. He trained
numerous well-known men of religion, and mainly for this reason is the
first Imam after 'Ali from whom large numbers of traditions are recorded.
He is buried in the Baqi' cemetery in Medina.

</p><p>VI.<b> <font color="#666600">The Sixth Imam, Ja'far <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Spa/7220/view.html">al-Sadiq</a></font></b>
(83/702-148/765)

</p><p align="justify">The son of the fifth Imam, he lived in an increasingly favorable climate
and was able to teach openly in Medina. <b>Large numbers of scholars gathered
around him to learn</b>, including such famous Sunni figures as <b>Abu
Hanifah</b>, the founder of one of the four Sunni schools of law. Towards
the end of <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Spa/7220/SayingsJafar.html">Imam
Ja'far</a>'s life severe restrictions were placed upon his activities,
as a result of growing Shi'ite unrest. More traditions are recorded from
him than from all the other Imams together. He is so important for Twelve-Imam
Shi'ite law that it is named the "<b><font color="#3333FF">Ja'fari School</font></b>"
after him. He is buried in the Baqi' cemetery in Medina.

</p><p>VII.<b><font color="#CC66CC"> The Seventh Imam, Musa <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Spa/7220/aql.html">al-Kazim</a></font></b>
(128/744-183/799)

</p><p align="justify">The son of the sixth Imam, he was contemporary with such Abbasid caliphs
as al-Mansur and Harun al-Rashid. He lived most of his life in Medina with
severe restrictions placed upon him and finally died in prison in Baghdad.
After him, the Imams were often not able to live in their traditional home
of Medina, but were forced to remain near the caliph in Baghdad or Samarra.
He is buried in Kazimayn in Iraq.

</p><p>VIII.<font color="#00CC00"><b> The Eighth Imam, 'Ali <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Spa/7220/SayingsRida.html">al-Rida</a></b>
</font>(148/765-203/817)

</p><p align="justify">The son of the seventh Imam, he lived in a period when the Abbasids
were faced with increasing difficulties because of Shi'ite revolts. Finally
the caliph al-Ma'mun thought he would solve the problem by naming the Imam
as his own successor, hoping thus to ensnare him in worldly affairs and
turn the devotion of his followers away from him. After finally being able
to persuade al-Rida to accept, al-Ma'mun realized his mistake, for Shi'ism
began to spread even more rapidly. Finally he is said to have had the Imam
poisoned. Al-Rida is buried in Mashhad in Iran.

</p><p>IX.<b> <font color="#000099">The Ninth Imam, Muhammad al-Jawad</font></b><font color="#990000">
</font>(195/809-220/835)

</p><p align="justify">The son of the eighth Imam, he was given the daughter of the caliph
al-Ma'mun in marriage and for a time was kept by the caliph in Baghdad.
But he was able to return to Medina until the end of al-Ma'mun's reign.
The new caliph, al-Mu'tasim, summoned him back to Baghdad where he died.
He is buried in Kazimayn in Iraq.

</p><p>X. <b><font color="#999999">The Tenth Imam, 'Ali al-Hadi</font></b><font color="#999999">
</font>(212/827-254/868)

</p><p align="justify">The son of the ninth Imam, he remained in Medina teaching the religious
sciences until 243/857, when he was summoned to Samarra by the caliph al-Mutawakkil.
There he was treated harshly by the caliph and his successors until he
died. He is buried in Samarra.

</p><p>XI.<b> <font color="#663300">The Eleventh Imam, al-Hasan al-'Askari</font></b><font color="#663300">
</font>(232/845-260/872)

</p><p align="justify">The son of the tenth Imam, he lived in close confinement in Samarra
under the watchful eye of the caliph, especially since it was known that
the Shi'ites were awaiting his son, the twelfth Imam, who was to be the
promised Mahdi or "guided one", destined to remove injustice from the world.
The eleventh Imam married the daughter of the Byzantine emperor, Nargis
Khatun, who, following instructions given her in a dream, had sold herself
into slavery to become his wife. He is buried in Samarra.

</p><p>XII.<b> <font color="#006600">The Twelfth Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi</font></b><font color="#006600">
</font>(b. 256/868)

</p><p align="justify"><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Spa/7220/Mahdi.html">The twelfth
Imam</a> lived in hiding under the protection and tutelage of his father
until the latter's death. Then he went into "occultation". In other words,
he became hidden from the eyes of ordinary men and appeared only to his
Deputies.

</p><p align="justify">In the year 329/939 his "greater occultation" began. It will continue
as long as God wills, but when he does appear once again, he will erase
evil and injustice from the world.
