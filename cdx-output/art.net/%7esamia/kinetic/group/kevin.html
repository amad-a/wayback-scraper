Born in 1960 Kevin Nathaniel Hylton spent his youth studying the visual 
and performance arts in 1978.  He was admitted to Yale University  
where as Scholar of the House, he distinguished himself in painting.  
It was during that time that he studied painting with Samia A. Halaby.

<p></p></blockquote>
After graduation, Hylton studied dance and began building musical instruments.  
His education was completed when he studied with master musicians such as Ephat 
Mujuru and Chief Bey.  While he focused on the mbira and the shekere, he studied 
other traditional African instruments.  His training covered not only playing the 
instruments but crafting them as well and included the study of vocal styles and dance.

Now he devotes his full attention to music and he is in high demand performing 
or teaching almost every night of the week.  Kevin teaches workshops for world percussion 
and the building and playing of traditional instruments; he is a foundingmember of the Spirit 
Ensemble, the Heritage Percussion Ensemble, the Kinetic Painting Group, 
and directs his own band -- Moment.  The 
Spirit Ensemble is so widely respected by musicians and audiences alike that it 
has become a cultural institution even as it remains invisible to the mainstream 
press.
