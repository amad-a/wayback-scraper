<h3>ARTIST OF PALESTINE:  Sari Khoury</h3>
<h3>Early experiences</h3>
<p><b>
After leaving Jerusalem, Sari Khoury moved to Ramallah with his family.  It 
was there in that marvelous mountain village that the early most marvelous
years of youthful consciousness took place.  Sari became aware of Palestine
and its historic culture amids the great social tradgedies imposed by Israel.  
He wrote to me:

"The dispassion of a homeland took its toll on our entire family.  As an 
impressionable child I witnessed all kinds of upheavals and painful situations 
and learned to internalize the agony of our impoverished status.  My therapy 
from all this was in drawing.  I drew figures, and tormented faces, old 
wrinkled people.  From an early age, I rejected bourgeois values, pretty 
objects of art, and political deception.  Even then, I knew that to pursue 
art would be a lonely voyage.  My quest was to meet the challenges I had to 
face.  I was then starting from square one as all the Palestinian people had 
to do.  I had to deal with the distorted images of my culture, and attempted 
to defend my identity to my Western friends who were duped by the media.  
I had to rise above that humiliation.
</p><p>
My early encounter with painting was in watching my older sisters create 
in watercolors and color pencils.  It was a tradition among school girls 
to exchange autographs with each other and to fill them with drawings and 
poems.  Those little images appealed to me.  I also took interest in comic 
books.  To me, they exemplified a sense of justice as in the old American 
Westerns where the bad guys always got put away.  The Israelis who took our 
homeland, to me,  were the bad guys, and would eventually be put away.  So I 
created my own comics dealing with themes of justice.  
</p><p>
I also spent countless hours at the American Council library looking at 
works of art of the masters.  My youthful associations included a friendship 
with the artist Kamal Bullata.  He and I met at the Orthodox club in Jerusalem 
in the mid fifties where we exhibited at the annual juried exhibitions.  That 
was an extremely nourishing friendship that included various discourses on art 
that helped crystallize 
my sense of esthetics.  
</p><p>
Social realism was the style that appealed mostly to young Palestinian 
artists then.  I experimented with it for a while, but felt then, as I do 
now, that as a style, it was a dead end.  Even though it  had it's place 
in an oppressed society.
</p><p>
Nationalistic and cultural influences are, for the most part, intrinsic 
to everything we do.  In art, symbols, images and historical precedents always 
make themselves apparent unconsciously.  So there is no reason to force feed those 
issues into one's art."
