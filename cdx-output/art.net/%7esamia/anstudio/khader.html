        Khader told me: "One day in Nablus when I was working helping my 
brother load the back of a truck a group of Israelis surrounded me.  
Suddenly four of them grabbed me.  I was only fourteen. They did 
not explain their actions nor show any Identification.  It was frightening.  
I was jostled rudely and thrown into their jeep.  As they took me away  
my mind raced over all the horror stories about Israeli settlers.  They
took me to a building questioned me rudely and on the following day they 
released me.  It turned out they were Israeli soldiers in plain clothes.  If I had 
known they were soldiers I would have been a little less scared.  Settlers are
brutal.  Those they kidnap are never seen again.  I remember that day
I was wearing a red shirt".

        Bilal told me:  "My grandmother remembers the days before the
establishment of Israel on our land of Palestine.  She told me about the 
forced exodus of the Palestinians from northern villages and how she came 
as a teenager to Nablus.  She remembers the terrorism of the Jewish gangs.
Of all the horrors the one which she repeated most was that of how on
the long agonized march some women were so thirsty that they collected and
drank their own urine.  To her it was a measure of the criminality of those
first Jewish settlers".
