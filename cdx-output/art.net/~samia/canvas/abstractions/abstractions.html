<h2>Selection of Pictures for Article</h2>
<p>by Samia A. Halaby</p><p>
Ali, <br>
These are all paintings which are part of the mainstream of my artistic expression.  I have
mostly a painter using oil as medium, but recently, I began to explore media.  You will find 
a few paper mache sculptures and some stitched and folded works.<br>

</p><p><img align="bottom" src="http://www.art.net/~samia/canvas/abstractions/432 Marching-tn.jpg">
<br>432 <i>Marching</i>, 1989.  Acrylic on canvas, 84 x 186 inches.
<br>This large painting was one of the final expressions of the project dealing with Canal
Street.  One day, I had gone out to photograph and perceived that the entire event at Canal
was like a dance.  Abtraction deals with the general and this entire experience was not unlike
observing and participating in political demonstrations.  For this reason the painting is titled
<i>Marching</i>.

</p><p><img align="bottom" src="http://www.art.net/~samia/canvas/abstractions/460 branching-tn.jpg">
<br>460 <i>Branching</i>, 1994. Oil on canvas, 36 x 36 inches.
<br>Just prior to my involvement with olive trees, I had begun to explore branching as a process
not only in trees but also in human behavior.  I did several works in oil and then did an
abstract kinetic painting on the subject.  You will see them in the Kinetic section.

</p><p><img align="bottom" src="http://www.art.net/~samia/canvas/abstractions/525 Density in air-tn.jpg">
<br>525 <i>Density in Air</i>, 1999. Oil on canvas, 28 x 20 inches.


</p><p><img align="bottom" src="http://www.art.net/~samia/canvas/abstractions/532 Green Hay-tn.jpg">
<br>532 <i>Green Hay</i>, 1999.  Oil on canvas, 18 x 18 inches.
<br>This painting is all about foliage in the wind.

</p><p><img align="bottom" src="http://www.art.net/~samia/canvas/abstractions/526 Quiet Fire in Blue Sky-tn.jpg">
<br>536 <i>Quiet Fire in Blue Sky</i>, 1999.  Oil on canvas, 36 x 48 inches.
<br>This painting is also about foliage and its play in the wind and the similarity of these
same principles of motion to all wave motion, even that of people waiting on line.

</p><p><img align="bottom" src="http://www.art.net/~samia/canvas/abstractions/D1649 Praying Mantis-tn.jpg">
<br>D1649 <i>Praying mantis</i>, 1999.  Gouache on paper, 27.5 x 30 inches. (ps. Ali, there
are many more works like this one.  Let me know if I should add more.)

</p><p><img align="bottom" src="http://www.art.net/~samia/canvas/abstractions/536 Olive shading-tn.jpg">
<br>536 <i>Olive Shading</i>, 2000.  Oil on canvas, 42 x 48 inches.
<br><i>Olive Shading</i> is about the beauty of sitting in the dappled shade under a tree in 
Palestine.  The texture of foliage is cast upon the texture of plowed earth and over layed 
with a third distribution patter, that of the scattered stones and rocks of Palestine.

</p><p><img align="bottom" src="http://www.art.net/~samia/canvas/abstractions/D1690 Textures of Ramallah-tn.jpg">&lt;
<br>D1690 Textures of Ramallah, 2000.  Acrylic on tyvek, 52 x 45 inches.
<br>Here is a conscious attempt at contrasting the various textures of trees I've grown to love
in Ramallah: Olive, along, fig, cypress, and many more.

</p><p><img align="bottom" src="http://www.art.net/~samia/canvas/abstractions/P534 Olive Orchard in My Studio-tn.jpg">
<br<i>Olive Orchard in My Studio, 2000.  Acrylic on polyester, 72 x 175 inches.
<br>After visiting the olive orchards of Salfit to be part of the film, <i>Zatoonat</i>, I felt 
a lasting sence of owe and satisfaction.  It kept bringing to my mind a warm loaf of bred just
removed from the oven.  It is tragic that now Israelis make it impossible to
be there anymore as they create barriers, confiscate land, and uproot trees, building their
criminal stangulation wall.

</br<i></p><p><img align="bottom" src="http://www.art.net/~samia/canvas/abstractions/538 Ulleiq-tn.jpg">
<br>538 <i>Ulleiq</i>, February 2000.  Acrylic in papier mache, 24 x 16 x 12 inches
<br>One of the many things that impressed my vision at Salfit was a weed called 
<i>Ulleiq</i> which hung from an almond tree and was growing thickly, tightly as though woven
against incursion.

<img align="bottom" src="http://www.art.net/~samia/canvas/abstractions/537 balata back-tn.jpg">
<br>537 <i>Balata</i>, February 2000.  Acrylic with paper mache, 11 x 17 x 6”

</p><p><img align="bottom" src="http://www.art.net/~samia/canvas/abstractions/D1857 Semite Weaving the Wind-tn.jpg">
<br>D1857 <i>Semite Weaving the Wind</i>, 2003.  Silkscreen monotype.  22 x 30 inches.

</p><p><img align="bottom" src="http://www.art.net/~samia/canvas/abstractions/551 Mountain Olives of Palestine-tn.jpg">
<br>551 <i>Mountain Olives of Palestine</i>, 2003.  Acrylic and paper on canvas. approx. 70 x 60 inches 
<br>This painting is made up of cut and stitched canvas.  Some parts have paper collaged in.  It
is one of my major works in response to my experience with painting olive trees.  Especially
significant was the impression of the huge old trunks of the olive trees of Palestine.

</p><p><img align="bottom" src="http://www.art.net/~samia/canvas/abstractions/554 Mountain Air of AlQuds-tn.jpg">
<br>554 <i>Mountain Air of alquds</i>, 2003.  Acrylic and paper on canvas, 84 x 48 inches.
<br>A tribute to the beautiful location of our great city now sadly occupied by strangers. 
Here is a painting in dedication to its future liberation.

</p><p><img align="bottom" src="http://www.art.net/~samia/canvas/abstractions/555 Three Dancers Flying-tn.jpg">
