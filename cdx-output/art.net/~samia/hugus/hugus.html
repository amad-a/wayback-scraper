<h1>THE POETRY OF RICHARD HUGUS</h1>

<p>
by Samia Halaby July 2004
</p><p>
Necessity and economy are the principles I find most beautiful in nature.  The river moves to
the sea interacting with more slowly moving earthen obstacles to find the most economic path 
downhill -- never merely a straight line between two points.  When this interaction between 
necessity and economy appears in art, then I recognize something valuable.  This is why I admire
the poetry of Richard Hugus.

</p><blockquote><h2>A Man Bought A House</h2></blockquote>
<p></p><h3>

A man bought a house on Cape Cod, but without making the usual arrangements. The worst point, 
and most embarrassing, was that he arrived with his family after a long drive from the Midwest 
only to find that the owners were still in the house and weren't told that it had been sold. 
Immediately, the man saw the mistake of not dealing with the owners directly, of not coming 
first to look at the house, of taking all their things and leaving Illinois without knowing 
where they were going. The house had not been "sold." The man had not bought it. On hearing 
the story of the man's dealings in Illinois, the owners could not believe their ears. They 
laughed at and derided the man. They became angry at the imposition. They made him repeat the 
story of his foolishness over and over - the story of the realtor with the plaid beret, the 
$18,000 downpayment, the papers that were to be "sent ahead" to his new house. When they 
sufficiently understood, they called neighbors over to hear the story again. Nevertheless, 
out of politeness, the owners cleared a place in the garage for the family to stay. The man's 
children, poorly clothed, slept in the owners' arms. The man's wife, always sensitive to 
public opinion, made it clear that her marriage to her husband was a mistake and that she 
thought him an utter fool.

</p><blockquote><h2>My Lover's New Boyfriend</h2><blockquote>
<p></p><h3>

My lover's new boyfriend sent to me in jail a framed portrait of her. It is as if to torment 
me. But I treat it carefully and hang it up on the wall of my cell. One day I notice the paper 
in back has come loose. I slip my hand underneath and find a brand new pistol. The guards never 
saw it. It is to make it possible for me to escape. It is from my lover, who waits for me on 
the outside.

<blockquote><h2>A Nuclear War</h2><blockquote>
<p></p><h3>

There had been a nuclear war. Almost everyone had drunk a dark-colored poison in order to die 
without pain. But the world was still beautiful and taking the poison seemed a mistake. One 
had to fight its effect of inducing sleep. Everywhere, people were doing things they always 
wanted to do. A little girl was driving a car on her lawn.  A young man and woman began 
speaking freely with each other and vowed to be together. But the poison occupied everyone 
with sleep and numbness. It seemed worse than the war. The ocean and the sun gave no sign 
that anything would end.

<blockquote><h2>Talent Show</h2><blockquote>
<p></p><h3>

A father was about to join his daughter in the lobby of a hotel. As he got out of the elevator 
he noticed his daughter succumb to signing up for something with a cheap salesman in a plaid 
suit. She was sitting at a table getting instructions from the salesman on the details of a 
talent show in Atlantic City. The salesman was holding up a large diagram showing the steps 
by which contestants would arrive at the talent show. The daughter was smoking a cigarette 
which the salesman had offered her. The father was furious that he had raised a daughter who 
would fall for such claptrap.

<blockquote><h2>Cargo Door</h2><blockquote>
<p></p><h3>

A jet plane is flying low over a city just after takeoff. From it falls a huge sheet of metal, 
turning in the air and crashing down between some buildings in the distance. This must have 
been the cargo door, because there fall next a few cars which the plane was apparently 
transporting. The cars land on a street and sidewalk, smashing all to pieces. Next, perhaps, 
the plane itself will crash.

<blockquote><h2>My Car</h2><blockquote>
<p></p><h3>

My car, which I had parked, somehow got into gear and took off wildly on its own. As it passed 
down the street in my full view, I hoped its top would be sheared off by an upcoming concrete 
overhang. But it wasn't. The car went on until its wheels locked and turned it around and 
around. It gained speed progressively until it went up a hill and flew off the top.

<blockquote><h2>Whirlpool</h2><blockquote>
<p></p><h3>

A man was unable to be with his wife and infant child because a whirlpool kept him at a 
different point in a large circle. Once, by diving under water, the man came up at the correct 
point and found that his small child was crying and needed comforting. But before he could 
reach his child a young man offered to help. The husband considered whether to interfere, but 
it seemed wrong to do so if he would so seldom be there. Yet, he did interfere, and the young 
man was jealous. Now his wife would have one less person to help her when he went inevitably 
away, and he realized what he had done was a mistake.

<blockquote><h2>The Ship of the Insane</h2><blockquote>
<p></p><h3>

A group of people who are clinically insane conspired to form a shipping company - a form of 
self-employment which would keep them out of mental hospitals and away from the imprisonment 
of medication. They were able to form the company because they chose staff who were totally 
convincing impostors - convincing ship's captains, convincing engineers, convincing deck hands, 
and so on. Among them were several "bankers" who helped them with the necessary credit to 
acquire their first ship by chartering a combination freight and passenger liner.
<p>
It is not long before the ship is out at sea, foundering. The passengers sit at their dining 
tables in stony silence, not even interested in another ship that has come to rescue the ship 
of the insane. As the passengers have faultlessly taken on the attitudes and dress of early 
20th century characters, showing no concern, it is not clear who is to be rescued and who is 
not. True, the ship has been drifting at sea because no one had the least idea how to run it. 
But perhaps what was abnormal was a ship that was not drifting at sea, a ship with engines 
running and a crew who were not actors. So placid were the crew that they slowly began to 
convince the rescuers that this was the case. They calmly discussed matters with their sane 
counterparts, point by point, in long discussions on deck, until everyone was in agreement. 
Two ships were now foundering at sea, ready to call for a third to rescue them. By this means, 
they reasoned, a large and profitable company would soon be formed.

<blockquote><h2>professor</h2><blockquote>
<p></p><h3>

An English professor taught a class in literature, but felt it was important to have students 
build bookcases first. Afterall, the books required for reading in the course needed to be put 
in a good place. It was important to build a library.
<p>
He and his students had access to a well-equipped carpentry shop on campus, but he himself was 
not a competent carpenter. Actually, he was not even a competent thinker, as he proceeded to 
take his class through the steps necessary for the fabrication of drawers, not bookcases. Okay, 
he said, drawers were necessary for the storage of writing materials involved in writing papers 
on the literature to be taught. They would hold paper and pens, computer disks, and so on.
</p><p>
But the drawer bottoms, which he pre-cut for the class on a Sunday in order to hurry up the 
process, were not square. They were parallelograms. It was therefore impossible, on Monday, 
to assemble the fronts and sides. Beside this, the drawers had to be put in a cabinet of some 
kind to be of any use. This meant a further detour from making the bookcases for the books to 
be read after the drawer problem was straightened out and the cabinets for the drawers were 
made . . . not to mention buying the books, reading them, and discussing them formally in class.
</p><p>
By the third week, the professor was anxious to get back on schedule and planned to drop drawer 
making for a day to take the class to the bookstore, both to buy books, and to examine their 
bookshelves. The class assembled in the carpentry shop where, in his hurry to start off on the 
field trip, the professor fatally stapled the upper half of his thumb to the side of a drawer 
as he demonstrated to the class the use of a pneumatic stapler with inch-and-a-quarter staples. 
This meant that instead of going to the bookstore the class went to the campus hospital. To get 
there, walking, one student held the drawer the professor's thumb was nailed to. Another 
carried his coat and briefcase. Another carried his glasses, which fell to the floor in the 
shock of the accident.
</p><p>
Always the teacher, even under these circumstances, the professor sat on his emergency room 
bed and, while waiting for the doctor, began a lecture on William Carlos Williams, poet and 
doctor. As if desperate to make medical tie-ins to English literature, and to show the 
relevance of everyday reality to this study, he also discussed the doctor in W. Somerset 
Maugham's Of Human Bondage.
</p><p>
At this point the class listened to him out of pity. He was only proving that there were no 
practical connections between literature and the rest of the world. And he was asking the 
nurses questions related to his lecture because, without his glasses, he couldn't see that 
they were not his students. With his hospital gown on, one could see his spiny back and 
polka-dot underwear. There was a tattoo on his upper arm which said "MOM."  And his hand 
appeared to be permanently attached to a ridiculous diamond-shaped drawer which would never 
hold anything.
