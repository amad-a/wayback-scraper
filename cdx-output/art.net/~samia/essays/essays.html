<h2>ESSAYS BY THE ARTIST</h2>
<p>

Two of the published papers which I have written on the subject of kinetic paintings are 
available to read here.  <a href="fisea96.html"><i><b>RHYTHMS, The Aesthetics of 
Electronic Painting</b></i></a> was written for the <i>Seventh International Symposium on 
Electronic Art</i> held in Rotterdam The Netherlands, September 16-20, 1996.  
And, <a href="fisea93.html"><i><b>TECHNOLOGY, ABSTRACTION AND 
KINETIC PAINTING</b></i></a> was written for the <i>Fourth International Symposium on 
Electronic Art</i> held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S.A. November 3-7, 1993.
</p><p>
In August of 1998 the Swedish government sponsored an Exhibition of the work of seven 
Palestinian artists.  There was much that was good but the book accompanying the show deserves
severe criticism.  You may read <a href="prestock.html"><i><b>WHY THE REVIEW WAS 
WRITTEN</b></i></a>.   And, you may read the review itself: <a href="stokholm.html">
<i><b>An Exhibition of the Work of Palestinian Artists</b></i></a>
