<h4>WASHINGTON SUMMIT AND THE DIFFICULT GOALS  </h4>

<p>The statement issued by US President Bill Clinton at the end of the Washington Summit yesterday reflected in diplomatic terms the failure of the summit to reach certain goals that were the reasons for the summit in the first place. Clinton's statement implied that the peace process is still going on and negotiations will be moved from Washington to the region next Sunday. The round-the-clock negotiations in the past two days in Washington showed clearly the Israeli hardline stand which refused to issue decisive resolutions fearing that such decisions might prompt the Palestinians to present a whole list of demands; if Israel thinks in such terms, then the future negotiations will probably face new dangers and obstacles. Israel's offer to start non-stop negotiations over unresolved issues might not be very effective since Israel has declared its unwavering stand concerning many disputed issues. The suggested non-stop talks might take months and months without reaching any concrete result. The only way out of this deadlock is that Israel should realize that delaying and stalling implementing agreements will only bring destruction to the whole region. <i>(Al-Quds--3 Oct 1996)</i></p>
<br><br>
<h4>NEGOTIATIONS ARE BACK TO SQUARE ONE </h4>

<p>It seems that pessimists have won the bet that Washington Summit will fail to reach any concrete results which were the reason for holding the summit in the first place. The differences are very wide: no agreement on redeployment from Hebron, Palestinians are not free to move between the West Bank and Gaza, and the tunnel issue was never tackled. The Israeli side does not want to give any commitments concerning implementing any of the agreements in the context of Oslo, Cairo, and Taba Accords; moreover, they insist that violence should be stopped, and that the Palestinians commit themselves to avoiding any new clashes and to resuming talks until an agreement is reached. But, the agreements that Israel wants implies that Palestinians must give more compromises. We have to stress that Palestinians cannot give in any more, and Israel tried in Washington to gain more time and international public opinion, and the best proof on that is that Netanyahu stated before leaving Washington that Israel will not compromise on any of its positions concerning the whole peace process. The next question would be the agenda of the Erez non-stop negotiations. Palestinians are very pessimistic concerning the future, and it seems that the only way to face Israel's hardline policies is through getting a unified Arab stand that can press Israel to move ahead in the Middle East process. <i>(An-Nahar--3 Oct 1996)</i></p>
<br><br>
<h4>ISRAEL HAS TO RESPOND NOW!!</h4>  

<p>One fact remained very clear despite the bloody events of last week and that is the Palestinian people is still seeking to achieve peace in the region while Israel has done its utmost to destroy the peace prospects through stalling in implementing overdue agreements signed with the Palestinians. The Palestinians had no intentions whatsoever to reach to the point that was witnessed last week in the territories; on the contrary, they gave Israel ample time to prove their claims on the ground. Israel used the time given in creating new facts on the ground in expanding settlements and demolishing Palestinian houses in Jerusalem in an attempt to Judaize the Arab sector of the Holy City. Therefore, any summit or meeting to rectify the peace process track should seek to resolve the real questions behind the recent circle of violence. In any case, the whole world is now closely watching Israel's response that should aim to end the existing tensions in the region. Israel is required to close the tunnel, to start redeployment from Hebron, and to embark with the Palestinians on serious final-status negotiations. There is no doubt that Washington Summit is a precious opportunity to invigorate the peace process, especially if the US is willing to overcome the sensitivities of the forthcoming presidential elections and play a more effective role that no other country can assume.  <i>(Al-Quds--2 Oct 1996) </i></p>

<br><br>
<h4>CAN WASHINGTON SUMMIT GET THROUGH THE DARK TUNNEL?!</h4>

<p>Now after losing the trust that was built among the different parties engaged in the peace process, and after seeing how the hope of ending the Arab-Israeli conflict is gradually diminishing, the real question that should be tackled is how can the Washington Summit mend what has been broken in terms of the peace process chances. The four leaders who are meeting in Washington are trying to save the peace process, and US President Bill Clinton has intervened, despite the presidential election campaign, in order to bring parties together to find a way out of the recent circle of violence. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's absence from the summit should be stressed as it clearly shows that Israel's policies will not be accepted forever. Mubarak tried in his move to send Israel and the US another message saying that Israel has gone too far in ignoring Palestinian rights, which can be an example of how Netanyahu will deal with other Arab countries in the context of the Arab-Israeli peace process. The US has a vital role in this summit to stop the collapse of the whole peace process, and as Mubarak put it yesterday" Arafat and King Hussein will explain to Clinton the anger and frustration of Palestinians and the Arab nation who chose peace as a strategy to maintain stability and prosperity in the Middle East. <i>(An-Nahar--2 Oct-96) </i></p>

<br><br>
<h4>THE SUPPORTIVE EGYPTIAN ROLE</h4>

<p>President Yasser Arafat's visit to Cairo yesterday and the talks he held with President Hosni Mubarak reflects the importance the Palestinians give to the vital role of Egypt regionally and internationally in support of the Palestinian cause. Egypt made commendable efforts with other Arab countries in the UN Security Council in issuing the decision which is considered by many observers as a diplomatic achievement.The Arabs and Palestinians gave Israel enough time to show its real commitment to the peace process, but Israel refrained by leading a more extreme policy against Palestinians and their rights on their lands especially in Jerusalem. Therefore the Washington Summit is supposed to be a qualitative step towards real progress in the peace process, and not just slogans that have proved to be very harmful since peace needs facts and results on the ground that ensure Palestinians legitimate rights.  <i>(Al-Quds--1 Oct 1996) </i></p>

<br><br>
<h4>WASHINGTON SUMMIT PUTS NETANYAHU'S INTENTIONS TO THE TEST </h4>

<p>All observers agree that Washington Summit is a step in the right direction to move the peace process ahead. But the real question put now is the time needed to see concrete steps taken by Israel in accordance with the peace process commitments. We do hope that Israel will not stall and delay once more until after the US presidential elections to be held after one month. The recent events in the Palestinian lands clearly show that any delay in implementing any agreement will be detrimental to the already dying peace process. Israeli PM Netanyahu's position is not easy since he has to consider his coalition government and the Jewish extreme groups that supported him in winning the elections. Even if these groups threaten to withdraw from the government, Netanyahu has many other choices to join with several other groups in favor of the peace process. The Washington Summit will not succeed or bring calm to the area unless Netanyahu commits himself to implement the signed agreements with the Palestinians. <i>(An-Nahar--1 Oct 1996) </i></p>
