<h2>JOINT PRESS RELEASE</h2>

<h3>
PALESTINIANS SUFFER FROM THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS 
OF ISRAEL'S TOTAL MILITARY SIEGE ON THE OCCUPIED 
TERRITORIES</h3></center>


<h3>1 October 1996, For Immediate Release</h3>



<p>The undersigned Palestinian human rights and non-governmental 
organizations are gravely concerned by the deteriorating human 
rights situation in the Occupied Territories of the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip. In addition to the Israeli military authorities' use of
excessive force in the last few days, resulting in the deaths of 60
Palestinians, including 10 children, and at least 1,600 injured
persons, the Israeli authorities have imposed a military siege on the
towns and villages of the West Bank. </p>



<p>The Israeli authorities have
isolated Palestinian towns and villages in the West Bank by declaring
Area C to be a closed military area. Area C is about 70 per cent of the
total area of the West Bank and its closure consequently isolates all
Palestinian population centers, whether they are located in Areas A, B,
or C. This action places Palestinian residents in a situation similar
to town arrest. Restrictions on movement have also been imposed within
the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p> Some areas are completely isolated as a result of the
siege. In addition, the complete closure of East Jerusalem, imposed in
January 1991 and intensified in March 1993, continues to prohibit
Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and the rest of the West Bank from
entering Israel and Jerusalem. On 30 September 1996, the Israel Defense
Forces stated that Israeli journalists were prohibited from entering
Area A, which is under the control of the Palestinian National
Authority. The Israeli authorities announced yesterday that they have
introduced a permit system for internal travel within the West Bank.</p>



<p>The siege imposed has had detrimental effects on the life of the 
residents of the area. The following is a summary of the main areas of
concern:</p>



<p><b>Health and medical treatment:</b> Reports indicate that shortages of 
medical supplies are already emerging. Ambulances and medical 
personnel have been prevented from moving freely from one area to
another, especially to major clinics and hospitals located in the main
towns and cities of the West Bank. Patients are also prohibited from
leaving their places of residence to enter areas where medical
facilities are located, and from entering hospitals inside Israel where
they receive treatment. Preliminary documentation reveals that at least
seven women have been restricted from proceeding freely to hospitals to
give birth. Medical supplies are also not reaching pharmacies and
hospitals, particularly since the main sources of pharmaceuticals are
located in the main towns of the West Bank, and exchange of goods
within the West Bank is very difficult. Medical personnel are
expressing deep concern over the rapidly deteriorating health situation
and potential emergence of new problems and health complications. The
situation is particularly acute since more than 1,600 persons in the
different parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have been injured
in the current violence and are currently receiving medical treatment.
Further, 14 patients from the Gaza Strip were prohibited on 29
September 1996 from leaving the Gaza Strip to receive medical treatment
in Israel and Jerusalem. They were delayed for more than two hours at
Erez checkpoint by the Israeli forces, and were eventually turned back.
Shortages in baby milk have also started to appear.</p>



<p><b>The economy and agriculture: </b>The closure has also affected the 
economy and has severely disrupted normal life in the West Bank. 
The agricultural sector is suffering since many farmers and their
workers are not able to reach their fields. This is expected to have
serious effects on crops that are in season. There is particular
concern about the olive crop, which has just come into season. The
siege also prevents farmers from marketing their produce outside their
own place of residence, causing them economic hardship. As a result,
there are shortages of fresh basic produce in the main towns,
particularly since produce from the north of the West Bank and Jericho
area are the main sources of supply for the rest of the West Bank.
Workers are also generally not able to reach their places of work
inside the West Bank. In addition more than 50,000 Palestinians are
prevented from reaching their places of work in Israel and Jerusalem.
Since 26 September 1996, the Israeli authorities have prohibited
Palestinian fishermen in Rafah, Khan Younis and areas surrounding Gush
Katif from access to the sea.</p>



<p><b>Education:</b> The closure is also disrupting education, particularly since
it is common for students and teachers to attend or teach in schools in
villages and towns other than those where they live.</p>



<p><b>Prisoners in Israeli Jails: </b>Family visits to the more than 3,500 
Palestinians held in Israeli prisons and detention centers are also
canceled now until further notice because of the siege. </p>



<p><b>Disruption of the Work of the Palestinian Courts and Lawyers: </b>Normal
internal legal proceedings in the West Bank are paralyzed. The military
siege has prevented court employees, including members of the
judiciary, from reaching their places of work in Area A. In addition
lawyers cannot reach their clients or represent them in the courts.</p>



<p><b>Curfew: </b>A strict curfew has been in effect since 27 September 1996 on
Hebron city and the nearby villages of 'Aroub and Beit Ommar. Parts of
Halhoul in Hebron district were also placed under curfew in the early
hours of Saturday 28 September 1996. Baqa al-Sharqeya in Tulkarem
district is under curfew for the fifth consecutive day. Hizma in
Jerusalem district is under curfew for the third day. The curfew was
lifted on Hebron for four hours on Sunday commencing at 4:00 a.m. This
was relatively useless for residents as they could not purchase the
needed supplies. The curfew was lifted again in Hebron city yesterday
morning for three hours from 5:00 a.m. As of yesterday evening,
'Einabous and Howwara near Nablus were also under curfew.</p>



<p>In addition, there is a heavy Israeli military presence of personnel,
arms, jeeps, tanks and armored personnel carriers, at the entrances of
the main towns, particularly Hebron, Nablus, Jenin, Ramallah,
Bethlehem, and in the Gaza Strip. The latest statements by Israeli
officials, particularly by Mr. Netanyahu, and the unusual increase of
the Israeli military presence is alarming. It causes fear that further
military operations against Palestinians may take place any minute. </p>



<p>The isolation of Palestinian towns and villages in the West Bank was
first imposed by the Israeli military authorities in March 1996.
Instead of the Israeli-Palestinian Agreements being used as a means of
furthering the prospects of peace, its provisions, particularly those
concerning the division of the West Bank into enclaves, have been used
by the Israeli authorities as an instrument of control. The siege is in
clear violation of the Israeli-Palestinian Agreement, particularly
Article XXI(8), which emphasizes that </p><blockquote>"the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
[are] a single territorial unit, the integrity and status of which will
be preserved during the interim period." </blockquote>The closure and restrictions
on movement are measures of collective punishment in clear violation of
Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection
of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949. <p></p>



<p>The continuation of the siege, and the other measures imposed by 
the Israeli authorities, such as curfews and heavy deployment of 
Israeli military personnel and tanks outside the main towns increases
tension. Military helicopters are still roaming over the area. In the
past, the undersigned human rights and civil society organizations have
warned of the consequences of such measures, which in fact provoke
further confrontations. Israel must be held fully responsible for any
consequences and deterioration in the human rights situation that may
result. The undersigned organizations call on the international
community of states and on international and local non-governmental
organizations to intervene with the Israeli authorities immediately
demanding:</p>

<ul>
<li>the immediate lifting of measures restricting movement imposed in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip, including the lifting of the current
siege and general closure; <br><br>
</li><li>a refraining from any unilateral measures
such as house demolition, settlement expansion, land confiscation,
detention and torture, which are illegal and attempt to change the
status and character of the West Bank, particularly Jerusalem, and the
Gaza Strip. In particular it should be demanded that Israel should
close the Western Wall Tunnel in Jerusalem immediately; <br><br>
</li><li>full respect
by Israel for its obligations under the Israeli-Palestinian agreements;
the immediate cancellation of all Israeli policies and measures
designed to create facts on the ground which prejudice and pre-empt the
outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian final status negotiations.
</li></ul>


<p>The international community is also responsible for ensuring the full
protection and security of Palestinian civilians in the current
situation.</p>
