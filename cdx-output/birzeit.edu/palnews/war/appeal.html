<center><h2>Appeal for reporting resources based on the experience of the "On the ground in Ramallah" website, http://www.birzeit.edu/palnews/war, updated 12 October 1996 and 6 April 1997.</h2>
<p><br>FROM NIGEL PARRY, BIRZEIT UNIVERSITY WEBMASTER</p></center>
<br>
<p><b>Note:</b> While the appeal has been running for over six months, items listed are still required. See the list for more details. Birzeit Webmaster, 6 April 1997.</p>


<h3>A new use for the Web</h3>
<p>As you will have noticed, we have spent this week providing a website to communicate from the ground on recent developments to interested parties around the world. The project, to the best of my knowledge, represents the first attempt by a non-media institution to offer a website with detailed, daily updates during a conflict situation. The site was used by activists in the U.S. and others around the world as a visual and testimony of the events in Palestine. </p>
<br>
<h3>Issues raised by the experience</h3>
<p>Although we were working late hours during the first several days of the crisis and some of our personnel were taking personal risks to bring you the news, the real difficulties encountered during this project were not these. Rather we found it difficult to produce the site with the existing equipment available to Birzeit University.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the Birzeit University website has been produced on IBM-compatable 486 and some 386 machines, some with as little as 4 MB RAM. Those of you involved with graphics production, even of the low resolution necessary for the Web, will appreciate how slow this process is. We have no digital cameras, something which would have freed us from the problems we faced when Ramallah went on strike and no photographic developers were availale for several days. In the end, we convinced one shop owner to open specially, to develop our films for us. Neither do we have video cameras and related "frame grabbers", which would have allowed us a greater option of choice in presenting images. The main university campus has one accessible image scanner. Our webserver is a 386 IBM-compatable with 8 MB RAM, making the kind of numbers of hits we were getting at the height of this crisis dangerously close to overloading the machine.</p>

<p>Birzeit University is currently funded 60% by the European Community, in common with other Palestinian universities. There are no university funds available to develop our Internet services. The university has been working on a funding proposal for "The Palestine Archive" which - if it currently existed - would have meant that a full-time Web News Team would have been available to more regularly update the "on the ground in ramallah" site. It would have also meant that faster computers, video and sound cards, slide/negative and flatbed scanners, digital cameras, DAT recorders for sound and other equipment would have been available to facilitate the process. </p>

<p>I am therefore appealing for support for this and the modular "Palestine Archive" funding proposal, which will solve these problems. One of the most important modules of this proposal provides for a 4-5 person news team, located in the various towns of the West Bank and Gaza, each armed with digital cameras, laptop computers and e-mail access. This way there could be daily, independent and detailed English-language reporting with images (layout space is not a problem when you have your own webserver!) from this country, and the individuals would be excellently placed to cover events such as those we have witnessed this last week. </p>
