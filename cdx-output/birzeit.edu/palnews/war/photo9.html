<h3>Day 2: Thursday 26th September 1996, "Helicopter gunships open fire on homes"</h3>

<p>Israeli <a href="/combatsim.com/ah-1w.htm">Cobra helicopters</a>, seen through the window of a house on which they had unleashed their explosive fire. The bullets fired by the guns attatched to the nose of these attack helicopters, are called <i>rasass khamis miya</i> ('500' bullets) by the
 Palestinians, a reference to the large number found on a bullet belt. The high explosive bullets are fired from a 20mm turreted cannon. (Link added 12/10/96). <i>Photo by Nigel Parry</i></p>

<p>The entire second floor patio of this family home, stretching the length of two of these windows, was raked with bullets. The family, including a baby and five year  old, were luckily unharmed. Bullets entered the family bedroom as well. A neighbour, who walked out his front door into an inside corridor, was hit in the 
head by shrapnel from one of the explosive bullets from the helicopter 
fire  as he walked 
past an A4-width window. Fortunately, the head injury was not serious.

<p>The owner of the house explained how the bullets had ripped apart objects outside and left a huge section of the wall missing (right). <i>Photo by Nigel Parry</i></p>

<p>Fragments of the bullets from the attack helicopter next to a metal door sliced through. The whole bullet measures about 10cm long, is very heavy and explosive, as suggested by their hollow and fragmented debris, that often folds open outwards. See next entry for pictures of the rounds.  <i>Photo by Nigel Parry</i></p> <br>
