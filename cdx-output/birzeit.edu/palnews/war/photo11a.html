<p>Recieved via e-mail: "One of your photos shows a group of 16 Israeli
soldiers on a rooftop with "a big machine gun". I am very familiar with weapons.
The weapon in question is an M2 .50 caliber machine gun, affectionately known by
American soldiers as "Ma Deuce". It fires a bullet one half inch in diameter that
weighs approx. 750 grains. This is a lead cored, copper jacketed bullet. It can
also fire tracers, armor-piercing (AP), and armor piercing incendiary (API)
rounds. This weapon is capable of penetrating the armor on the Israeli armored
personnel carriers (M113) you see. It is a very powerful weapon which I had been
instructed was outlawed by the Geneva Convention for use against people. It is
legal only for 'the destruction of enemy material and equipment'. This provides the
loophole for shooting people with it: "I wasn't aiming for him, I was trying to
destroy his canteens, belt buckle, etc." I hope this info helps." (Laurence Duckles)</p>
