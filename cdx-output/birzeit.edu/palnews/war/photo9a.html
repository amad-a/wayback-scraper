<h2>Photo Diary</h2>

<h3>Day 2: Thursday 26th September 1996, "Ammunition used"</h3>

<center><img src="/birzeit.edu/palnews/war/images/49-6.jpg"></center>
<p>Circular "rubber" or "plastic-covered" bullets, from left to right: (i) the cover, 1 mm thick of pretty uncompromising plastic; (ii) a bullet with the plastic cover slightly removed to reveal the steel bearing inside; (iii) a fully covered bullet; and (iv) a fully uncovered bullet. There are around 15 to a cannister, which is fitted to the end of a rifle barrel and detonated with (I suspect) a blank round). If anyone can point me to a resource on the Web related to this weapon, I would be grateful.  <i>Photo by Nigel Parry</i></p>

<p>Fragments of the high explosive ammunition fired from the <a href="/combatsim.com/ah-1w.htm">Cobra helicopter</a> (AW-1W Super Cobra Helicopter). Note the piece (center back) which has clearly exploded outwards. The section to the right of that is the nose of one. These and the fragments of shrapnel were collected from outside the apartment block shown in the entry <a href="/birzeit.edu/palnews/war/photo9.html">Helicopter gunships open fire on homes</a>. Again, point me to a resource on the Web with details of the 20mm turreted cannon used by the Cobra, I would be grateful.  <i>Photo by Nigel Parry</i></p>
