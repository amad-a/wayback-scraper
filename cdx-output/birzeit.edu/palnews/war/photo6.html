<p>A Birzeit student lies on a hospital bed while a friend sits with him. According to the administrative director, who I spoke with at 10:50pm, hospital records stated that 4 people had been killed, including a 15-year-old boy, and 263 injured. About twenty-five of the wounded still remained in the hospital but the rest were well enough to be discharged. Two men lay brain dead in intensive care. Another Birzeit student, Yasser Abdul Ghani, was shot with live ammunition in the chest. The bullet, which ricocheted inside his chest cavity, stuck both sides of his heart and a lung. When I went to see him in intensive care he was stable but still critical. Pictures of him exist on film but are still being developed. <i>Photo by Nigel Parry</i></p>
