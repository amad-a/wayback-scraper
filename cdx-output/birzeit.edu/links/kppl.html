in Cairo, November 1996</p>

<p>The Palestinian Authority's <a href="/pna.net/peace/" style="pointer-events: none;">Peace Process</a> section of their website includes some of the documents and information about the Palestinian Authority's Political Programme. Its <a href="/pna.net/facts/" style="pointer-events: none;">Facts about Palestine</a> section includes historical essays, maps, and introductions to various aspects of Palestinian society.</p>

<p>The Palestine Information Center offers <a href="/alquds.org/palestine/peace/index.html" style="pointer-events: none;">peace-process related documents and accompanying articles</a> as well as <a href="/alquds.org/palestine/history/index.html" style="pointer-events: none;">historical documents pertaining to the question of Palestine</a>.</p>

<p>The weekly Palestinian <a href="/jerusalem-times.com/" style="pointer-events: none;">Jerusalem Times newspaper</a> has a website, although navigational and stylistic problems make finding what you need a little difficult.</p>

<p>There is however, a series of local non-governmental organisations which offer press releases and news via e-mail.

<p>The <a href="/arts.mcgill.ca/mepp/pdin/pdfront.html" style="pointer-events: none;">Palestinian Development InfoNet</a> disseminates information on development assistance and reconstruction in the West Bank and Gaza for use by NGOs, the private sector, policy makers, and scholarly researchers. The PDIN website is maintained by the Interuniversity Consortium for Arab Studies (Montréal), with the support of the Arts Computer Network, McGill University, and the World Bank.</p> 

<p>The <a href="/palecon.org/" style="pointer-events: none;">Palestine Economic Forum</a> website offers publications including the excellent <i>Palestine Economic Pulse</i>, <i>West Bank and Gaza Update</i>, <i>Peace Economics</i>, articles and papers, and a discussion forum, which includes topics such as Public Sector Finances and Administration, International Trade, Investment, and Capital Flows, Private Sector Development, Human Resources, and Permanent Settlement Issues.</p>

<p><a href="/arts.mcgill.ca/mepp/unsco/unfront.html" style="pointer-events: none;">UNSCO</a> offers <a href="/arts.mcgill.ca/programs/polisci/faculty/rexb/directory/index.html-ssi" style="pointer-events: none;">useful directories</a> of NGOs and Donor Country NGOs operating in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>See <a href="/ipcri.org/ipcri8.html" style="pointer-events: none;">Recommendation on Steps to be Taken With Regard to Palestinian Economic Development Needs in Relationship to Israeli Security Needs</a>, from the <a href="/ipcri.org/" style="pointer-events: none;">Israel-Palestine Center for Research and Information (IPCRI)</a>. It assumes Israel actually cares about Palestinians and plugs the "industrial zones" idea (read: cheap labour) but it has some good points to make.</p> 

<p>Palestine has a stock exchange! 1996 was the worst year ever for the Palestinian economy, but even in the worst of conditions, an efficient stock exchange should bring in higher investment. Indeed, the new Palestine Securities Exchange is doing its best to be efficient -- and has hopes for foreign investors from the Palestinian Diaspora, and even Israel. See <a href="/link.co.il/57/57palstocks.htm" style="pointer-events: none;">Securities in a time of Insecurity</a> from <a href="/link.co.il/" style="pointer-events: none;">LINK</a> magazine. </p>

The <a href="/birzeit.edu/aff/index.html" style="pointer-events: none;">Academic Freedom First</a> website, produced by the <a href="/birzeit.edu/hrap/index.html" style="pointer-events: none;">Human Rights Action Project</a> at Birzeit University, offers an insight into the problems face by Gazan students who want to study in the West Bank. The control of movement, through checkpoints and a tightly-monitored permit system, is one of the biggest 'souring' influences for Joe Palestinian, who is being asked to support the peace process. Oslo has seen a worsening of this trend. <p></p>

<p>Birzeit University's <a href="/birzeit.edu/hrap/index.html" style="pointer-events: none;">Human Rights Action Project</a> is an excellent way of getting to grips with human rights as the community under scrutiny is that of a university with a population of only around 4,000 students.

Excellent for getting a sense of how violent events unravel, how the Israeli army responds to Palestinian demonstrations, and what the politicians say afterwards. An extraordinarily popular website that resulted in $15,000 of equipment funding for Birzeit to expand its Web reporting. </p>

The diary attempts to explain aspects of life here for Palestinians. The diary is searchable and is organised in chronological and subject indicies, with a focus on events affecting the university community of Birzeit. Here is what the Jewish Communications Network said about the diary: "A rare opportunity to see the post-Oslo period from a jarringly anti-Israeli perspective, and yet a perspective that is mature, sensitive and stylistically compelling. Watch out, you might become addicted to this site, returning frequently to seek out new diary entries. Peace engenders communication. We like the open tone of critical respect of this site -- reflecting one view -- yet presenting a break with the implacable style of past discourse. Polished and professional."</p>
