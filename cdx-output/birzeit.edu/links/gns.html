But the sections on Medical Care, which has info about services provided, locations of Arabcare institutions throughout Palestine, and the technologies used in these institutions, - and Health Insurance, which contains limited information about Arabcare's nationwide insurance policies are worth looking through.

Then, if you go to the main index page, you will see a display of blossoming flowers and flying butterflies all over your screen.  If you can manage to wade through all this, you'll find links taking you to pages about the history, geography, and municipality of the town, which can be rather interesting if you haven't read anything about Halhul before.

HDIP was established in 1989 by a group of researchers and health practitioners committed to improving the status of health care for all Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. They recently relaunched their website and it really is quite impressive. Links to the activities of HDIP, their database and archives of publications some of which are summarized online. They also offer GIS (Geographical Information System) services and can produce maps for the public at the low cost of 50 shekels per theme. Examples of these maps are available online.

 - A huge amount of information on this page about the end-1997 national census that got the Israelis so uptight when it <a href="/birzeit.edu/links/goldeno.html" style=""><img height="96" width="94" align="RIGHT" border="1" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="/birzeit.edu/links/images/goldeno98.gif"></a> deemed to include Jerusalem. Information includes Legal Foundation, Historical Background, History of Censuses in Palestine, Census Stages, Justification, Census Contents, Outputs, Main Variables and Indicators, Confidentiality, Census Date Count Down, a message from the Offices of National Director, National Committee, Sub Committees, Supporting Committees, Acknowledgment For Donors, Donors Contribution, Census Plan, Dissemination and Publication Plan and Prelimintary Results, and an Appeal For All Palestinians to: fund it or make a technical contribution. If that wasn't enough, there is also the Census Progress in Pictures, Census Publications and...Other Activities.

<a name="ramallah"></a> <font size="2" color="BLACK"> <b>Ramallah Municipality: <a href="/ramallah-city.org/" style="pointer-events: none;">http://www.ramallah-city.org/</a> </b> - Similar in many ways to the <a href="/birzeit.edu/links/#albireh" style="pointer-events: none;">Al-Bireh Municipality</a> website above, the Ramallah Municipality website basically offers more information, including a profile, history, details of the town council, projects, culture, and its role as a resort. The latter is perhaps a little misleading. Although Ramallah once enjoyed the reputation as the second most popular summer resort in the Arab World during the early 1960s, the Israeli occupation terminated this role completely through travel restrictions and de-development. <b>Added to Complete Guide: 16 February 1998.</b> <a href="/birzeit.edu/links/#top" style="pointer-events: none;">Top of page.</a></font><br><br><br>

The siteoffers information about UPMRC - its missions and background, and a variety of published material in its "Health in Palestine" section.

Unfortunately, the English version is under construction, and the Arabic version turns into gibberish on my screen, no matter what I try.  It recommends Internet Explorer 4.x or above, which I don't happen to have, so you're on your own for this one.  I read recently that WAFA was offering regular Real Audio broadcasts of their material from their website but I couldn't find that either. <b>Added to Complete Guide: 17 March 1998.

Can't quite remember the year of the General Assembly resolution condemning Zionism as racism? Not sure what UN resolution 181 said? Want the text of the Oslo Accords or the Wye Agreement? This is the place to go. An excellent site with tons of valuable information.
