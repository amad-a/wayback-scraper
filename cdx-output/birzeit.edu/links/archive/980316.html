<ul>
<li><b>7 March 1988</b> - Free Ahmad Qatamesh, the website for Ahmad Qatamesh, the longest serving administrative detainee, was recently launched and is now catalogued. Ahmad has been in prison without charge or trial for five years. An attractive website design, content and timeliness made this March's website of the month. See <a href="/birzeit.edu/links/hr.html#faq" style="pointer-events: none;">http://www.birzeit.edu/links/hr.html#faq</a> for the review. <br><br>

It's got a great collection of links. <br><br>

Please webmasters of Palestinian websites, if you are not listed it is not personal. Most likely we just don't know that you exist. Tell us! Also added: In'ash El-Usra society (review: <a href="/birzeit.edu/links/ona.html#inash" style="pointer-events: none;">http://www.birzeit.edu/links/ona.html#inash</a>) in organisations and associations, and the Al-Bireh (review: <a href="/birzeit.edu/links/gns.html#albireh" style="pointer-events: none;">http://www.birzeit.edu/links/gns.html#albireh</a>) and the Ramallah municipalities (review: <a href="/birzeit.edu/links/gns.html#ramallah" style="pointer-events: none;">http://www.birzeit.edu/links/gns.html#ramallah</a>) webpages in government and services. <br><br>

</li><li><b>14 February 1998</b> - Alami Electronics, Jerusalem (review: <a href="/birzeit.edu/links/inc.html#alami" style="pointer-events: none;">http://www.birzeit.edu/links/inc.html#alami</a>) was added to the Internet &amp; Computers section.

<a name="ipcon"></a><h3>FACTS: ISRAELI VS.PALESTINIAN CONNECTIVITY </h3>

<p>Some 10,000 Israeli websites exist on the World Wide Web, ten times more than the number two years ago. In addition, some 170,000 Israeli subscribers are connected to the Internet. These are some of the figures that were released at the Israeli Business Management Center convention in Tel Aviv on Thursday 26 February 1998. </p>

<p>In contrast, around 140 Palestinian websites exist and perhaps 2,000 Palestinians are connected to the Internet. Both estimates represent just over 1% of the Israeli figures. </p>

<a name="column"></a><h3>NEW COLUMN: THE INTERNET IN THE MIDDLE EAST</h3>

<p>For those of you who can't get enough of the Internet in the Middle East, here is notice of a monthly column I am writing for Middle East International magazine. </p>

<p>Unfortunately MEI doesn't have a website but the articles are also available online at: <a href="/birzeit.edu/nigelparry/writing/" style="pointer-events: none;">http://www.birzeit.edu/nigelparry/writing/</a> </p>

<p>The first article covered the Palestinian presence on the Internet, "Permission to Narrate", the second "Other voices in the Iraqi conflict." Next up is an article about the Israeli Internet community. </p>

<p><b>Palestine Economic Forum</b>: <a href="/palecon.org/" style="pointer-events: none;">http://www.palecon.org/</a></p>

<p>The Palestine Economic Forum seeks to "promote prosperity and the peace process by bringing in the economic dimension on a broad set of issues that are at the cutting edge of Palestinian economic development." </p>

<p>On the website, you will find extensive information on the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS), publications including the excellent Palestine Economic Pulse, West Bank and Gaza Update, Peace Economics, articles and papers, and a discussion forum, which includes topics such as Public Sector Finances and Administration, International Trade, Investment, and Capital Flows, Private Sector Development, Human Resources, and Permanent Settlement Issues. </p>

<b></b><p><b>Ray Hanania, <i>I'm glad I look like a terrorist: Growing up Arab in America</i></b>: <a href="/hanania.com/book.htm" style="pointer-events: none;">http://www.hanania.com/book.htm</a></p>

<p>An excellent book. I'm not just saying this because Ray is advertising with us, but because I actually read the book and liked it a lot. In fact I stupidly started reading it at 1.00am, and only fell asleep after finishing it at 4.00am, as the muezzins were beginning the call for prayer. There should be a government health warning on this one. Visit <a href="/hanania.com/" style="pointer-events: none;">http://www.hanania.com/</a> as well. Ray is a well established journalist, with a lot of very interesting writings on his website. </p>

<p>Hey! Advertise with the Complete Guide!. Did you know that each banner advert that runs for a year enables Birziet University to purchase a new computer? More information from <a href="/birzeit.edu/links/advert.html" style="">http://www.birzeit.edu/links/advert.html</a> </p>

<p>Please also visit Lycos and Excite's city net pages from the explanatory text on the <a href="/birzeit.edu/links/" style="">Complete Guide homepage</a> and encourage them. These are two search engines that recognise that the West Bank and Gaza are disputed territories that are not automatically part of Israel. ABC News has also addressed this geopolitical issue in a thoughtful way. </p>

<p>Another Birzeit first today. In my diary coverage of the local clashes on 11 March, I have added some audio captured from the clashes. If Real Audio is your thing, pop on by to <a href="/birzeit.edu/diary/ramallah/980311d.html" style="pointer-events: none;">http://www.birzeit.edu/diary/ramallah/980311d.html</a></p>

<p>Well, that's all folks. </p>
