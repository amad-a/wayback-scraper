<b>Bailasan, Palestinian Internet Services Company: <a href="/bailasan.com/" style="pointer-events: none;">http://www.bailasan.com/</a></b> - Bailasan, is another web design company that has appeared in Palestine. Looks fresh, but what ideas it does seem to have are not well implemented. The "Our Jerusalem" section of the website, with a domain name of its own (www.our-jerusalem.org), is a nice idea, with historical, business and tourism sections. Yet the information is presented in a boring way, with broken links and unfinished work apparent everywhere. The limited information about the gates of Jerusalem, assuming that you were interested in them anyway, is what you would find in any guidebook. Same goes for the material on the different quarters of the Old City. The "Religious Affairs" section of Bailasan's website leads you to the "HomePage Of the Islamic Palestinian Scholar BASSAM JARRAR" [sic], where you can read two of his books online. Perhaps the saddest part of the website is the PINC, the Palestine Internet News Center, "your daily access to News, Reports and Investigations from Palestine". The "This Week" news section (bear in mind I am writing this in December) includes "Israeli bulldozers destroyed Christian Holy Sites in mount Abu Ghniem", "Head of the Knesset tries to prevent an Arab councilman from speaking in the memory of June War", and "Israelis run a begging
network in cities of the West Bank". In other words, this week's "news" is six months old. Pictures from Palestine leads to a "File Not Found" (you'd think they might notice that a homepage button bar link doesn't work?) and "What's New?" (the final revelation) leads to an empty page "where we will be presenting sites that are done by Bailasan". In other words, <i>How To Destroy Your Public Image Single-Handed 101</i>. <font size="2"><b>Added to Complete Guide: 6 February 1997.

<b>Baraka, the Palestinian NGO Network: <a href="/baraka.org/" style="pointer-events: none;">http://www.baraka.org/</a></b>  - Baraka, the Palestinian NGO service provider, launched its website in mid-1996. Information is provided about PNGO (the Palestinian NGO network), a few other NGOs, and links to other Palestinian sites. An e-mail address list for all its member organisations would be welcomed, as would homepages for all the NGOs that in the country. To be fair, Baraka has been through a difficult administrative period recently, and we are hoping that it will work out before all the NGOs defect to Palnet. <font size="2"><b>Review last updated: 19 December 1997.</b> <a href="/birzeit.edu/links/#top" style="pointer-events: none;">Top of page.</a></font><br><br><br>

The various searchable business and service directories are noticeably incomplete. The Palestine Internet Directory, "The most comprehensive Palestinian directory service on the net that helps you find individuals and institutions by name or by sector" isn't and doesn't. The "Attractions" section, with material on art, educational systems, etc., is almost without information. The "Palestine Information Highway" is the most outrageous, a Complete Guide to Palestine's Websites clone, down to many of the category titles and criminal use of a PhotoShop-altered Birzeit University logo! Clearly, no one has the time to actually make the clone a clone, as links to sites once you get inside the categories are noticably absent. Another <a href="/birzeit.edu/links/#bailasan" style="pointer-events: none;">Bailasan</a> pupil. For anyone else planning on running a reviewed guide to Palestine's websites, note that this relaunch required one month's work on redesigning and implementing the design, a week's work re-reviewing the existing 88 sites, and another week finding the new sites. Add to that another two months work to produce and update the two previous versions and you have three and a half months of the time of a staff member to account for. By all means do it, just do it properly. <font size="2"><b>Added to Complete Guide: 6 February 1997.

PALNET's website has developed its links, although navigating through them can be a little boring, as only the titles of websites are offered with no reviews. The site also offers an interesting guide to Palestine's economy for those wanting to invest here, as well as government and business contact addresses. PALNET were at the Palestine International Festival 1996 and 1997, offering opportunities for visitors to browse the Web, and hopefully will make a reappearance this coming year. A dynamic company with 470 individual and institutional customers at the November 1996 count, rising to 852 by August 1997. Palnet offers a 128K leased line to Birzeit University and various Palestinian ministries, soon to be upgraded to at least double the speed. <font size="2"><b>Review last updated: 19 December 1997.</b> <a href="/birzeit.edu/links/#top" style="pointer-events: none;">Top of page.</a></font><br><br><br>

The pizzas and food are great in this restaurant, with the Birzeit Webmaster's recommendation being the Venetian, allowing for the occasional defection to a Hawaiian. The homepage has both K5M restaurant and Internet price menus, photos of the cafe and a list of K5M's catering services. In case you were wondering, K5M's name comes from the 6 brothers that own the restaurant - 5 of them have names starting with M and one with K. Or is it the other way round?
