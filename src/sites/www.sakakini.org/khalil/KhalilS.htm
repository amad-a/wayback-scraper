<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Khalil Sakakini Cultural Centre was named after a
pioneering Palestinian educator. Until the late 1960�s, thousands of young
Palestinians received their primary education from the school books he
authored. His memory lives on thanks to the innovative Arabic language
and grammar teaching methods he devised, his political and literary writings,
and the breadth of his educational mission,. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Khalil Sakakini was born in Jerusalem on January 23, 1878.
He received his schooling there, at the Greek Orthodox school, at the CMS
College, and at the Zion English College where he read Literature. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Following the death of his father, Sakakini traveled to
the United Kingdom and from there to the United States to study education.
However, he was unable to pursue his studies due to financial constraints
and returned to Palestine in 1908. During his American stay, he was active
teaching Arabic, translating, and contributing to the Arabic literary magazines
of the East Coast. Upon his return, he worked as a journalist for the Jerusalem
newspaper <I>Al Asmai'</I> and taught Arabic at the renowned Jerusalem
<I>Salahiyya</I> school, and to expatriates at the American Colony </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1909, he founded the <I>Dusturiyyah</I> school, which
became known for its Arab nationalism. He pioneered a system he was to
use later: there were no grades, prizes or punishments for students; and
there was an emphasis on music education and athletics. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sakakini led a movement to reform and Arabize the Greek
Orthodox Church in Palestine, and wrote a pamphlet in 1913 titled &quot;The
Orthodox Renaissance in Palestine&quot;, which led to his excommunication.
Ottoman authorities arrested him in 1917 and jailed him in Damascus for
sheltering a Jewish-Polish immigrant who was -unbeknownst to him- an American
spy. After his release, he joined the ranks of the Arab Revolt, which anthem
he wrote. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1919 Khalil Sakakini went to work for the Educational
Authority of Palestine in Jerusalem, and was appointed head of the Jerusalem
Teachers� College. He went on to be appointed Inspector for Education for
Palestine, a post he held for twelve years, until his resignation in protest
at the appointment of Herbert Samuel as High Commissioner in Palestine.
At the same time, he wrote political commentaries for the newspapers <I>Al
Muqtataf</I>, <I>Al Hilal</I> and <I>Al Siyassa</I> <I>al Usbu`iyya</I>,
composed a number of patriotic poems, and spoke at political rallies. In
1925, Khalil Sakakini founded the <I>Wataniyya</I> school, and in 1938
the <I>Nahda</I> College in Jerusalem. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Khalil Sakakini's wife, Sultana, died in October 1939.
He lived in consummate grief since, and wrote a number of poems eulogizing
her. He also wrote his will and obituary. In 1948, a few days before the
city was divided and its western part seized by the Israelis, the Sakakinis
fled Jerusalem, the last Palestinian family remaining in the Qatamon quarter
ravaged by Israeli mortar attacks. They left with only their personal effects,
and sought refuge in Cairo where Sakakini was nominated by the Egyptian
writer Taha Hussein to join the Arabic Language Academy. The sudden death
of his son Sari in 1953 left him in poor health, and he died three months
later on August 13, 1953. He is survived by two daughters, Dumya and Hala,
now living in Ramallah, and who have had long careers in education. Hala
edited her father's journals published in 1955, and also wrote two memoirs
in English: <I>Jerusalem and I</I>, and <I>Twosome.</I> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Khalil Sakakini left <A HREF="photos/p6n.gif">12 publications</A>
to his name, including educational works, poetry collections, literary,
ethical and political essays, and a journal. Over seven books and essays
have been <A HREF="photos/p7n.gif">published about him. </A></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A street and a school in Jerusalem were named after him,
the Jazzar's mosque library in Acre, and a Cairo street. His papers are
now at the Hebrew University. He is buried in Cairo, his house and the
schools he ran are now under Israeli rule in West-Jerusalem, and have been
converted to other purposes. </FONT></P>
