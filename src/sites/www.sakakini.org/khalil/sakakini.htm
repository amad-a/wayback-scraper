<p><font color="#408080"><font size="+1">Khalil Sakakini was born in Jerusalem
on January 23, 1878. He received his schooling there, at the Greek Orthodox
school, at the CMS College, and at the Zion English College where he read
Literature. </font></font></p>
<p><font color="#408080"><font size="+1">Following the death of his father,
Sakakini traveled to the United Kingdom and from there to the United States
to study education. However, he was unable to pursue his studies due to
financial constraints and returned to Palestine in 1908. During his American
stay, he was active teaching Arabic, translating, and contributing to the
Arabic literary magazines of the East Coast. Upon his return, he worked
as a journalist for the Jerusalem newspaper <i>Al Asmai'</i> and taught
Arabic at the renowned Jerusalem <i>Salahiyya</i> school, and to expatriates
at the American Colony </font></font></p>
<p><font color="#408080"><font size="+1">In 1909, he founded the <i>Dusturiyyah</i>
school, which became known for its Arab nationalism. He pioneered a system
he was to use later: there were no grades, prizes or punishments for students;
and there was an emphasis on music education and athletics. </font></font></p>
<p><font color="#408080"><font size="+1">Sakakini led a movement to reform
and Arabize the Greek Orthodox Church in Palestine, and wrote a pamphlet
in 1913 titled &quot;The Orthodox Renaissance in Palestine&quot;, which
led to his excommunication. Ottoman authorities arrested him in 1917 and
jailed him in Damascus for sheltering a Jewish-Polish immigrant who was
-unbeknownst to him- an American spy. After his release, he joined the
ranks of the Arab Revolt, which anthem he wrote. </font></font></p>
<p><font color="#408080"><font size="+1">In 1919 Khalil Sakakini went to
work for the Educational Authority of Palestine in Jerusalem, and was appointed
head of the Jerusalem Teachers� College. He went on to be appointed Inspector
for Education for Palestine, a post he held for twelve years, until his
resignation in protest at the appointment of Herbert Samuel as High Commissioner
in Palestine. At the same time, he wrote political commentaries for the
newspapers <i>Al Muqtataf</i>, <i>Al Hilal</i> and <i>Al Siyassa</i> <i>al
Usbu`iyya</i>, composed a number of patriotic poems, and spoke at political
rallies. In 1925, Khalil Sakakini founded the <i>Wataniyya</i> school,
and in 1938 the <i>Nahda</i> College in Jerusalem. </font></font></p>
<p><font color="#408080"><font size="+1">Khalil Sakakini's wife, Sultana,
died in October 1939. He lived in consummate grief since, and wrote a number
of poems eulogizing her. He also wrote his will and obituary. In 1948,
a few days before the city was divided and its western part seized by the
Israelis, the Sakakinis fled Jerusalem, the last Palestinian family remaining
in the Qatamon quarter ravaged by Israeli mortar attacks. They left with
only their personal effects, and sought refuge in Cairo where Sakakini
was nominated by the Egyptian writer Taha Hussein to join the Arabic Language
Academy. The sudden death of his son Sari in 1953 left him in poor health,
and he died three months later on August 13, 1953.
