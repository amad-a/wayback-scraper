Palestinian artists working today, he has pioneered the use of local media:
leather, natural dyes, papier-mache, and straw during the Intifada years.
He held his seventh exhibit at the Sakakini in December 1996. He was awarded
in 1997 the first Palestine Prize for Visual Arts.</font>

Halhoul, and graduated in photography from the Fine Arts College of Alexandria
in 1969. Anani is a multi-talented artist, for he is a painter and a ceramist,

<p><font size="4">He privileges the medium in his approach to
work. :&quot; In general, what represents for me the strongest
stimulus, is the medium with which I work, added to it, a mix of
sensations that come form ancient memory, mixed with the present
and the past... How does it begin ?, a handful of henna thrown on
a humid leather hide?, a horizontal line snaking its way onto an
unusual surface ?, the dialogue continues until I am convinced
that this work is part of my personal plastic vision&quot;. </font><br>
