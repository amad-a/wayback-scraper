In September 1999 the Sakakini center sent 4 young Palestinian artists to Amman�s Darat al Funoun. This most prestigious visual arts organization in the Arab world ( see links section) organized to celebrate its 10 anniversary the first summer academy for young Arab artists, under the direction of Syrian artist Marwan Qassab-Bashi. Other countries participating were Jordan, Bahrain and Syria. 
</p><p>The month long free style instruction covered etching, printing and drawing. A group exhibit was held at the end of the month. The Sakakini held in December an exhibit for the Palestinian participants: Mohammed Hawajri, Mohammed Abu Sill, Raed Issa and Rana Bishara. The works showed the clear progression and transformation in most of the participants� work from traditionally symbolic works to more free and thoughtful works. Qassab-Bashi�s works also heavily influenced them, as most of the works produced during their stay were of his favorite subject matter: faces. Issa and Abu Sill concentrated on watercolors, Hawajri on oil and Bishara on mixed media.
