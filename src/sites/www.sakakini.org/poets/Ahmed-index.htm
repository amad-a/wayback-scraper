<p><font size="+1">Dahbour was born in Haifa in 1946, but has lived in exile
since 1948. He has now returned to Palestine and lives in Gaza City where
he works as a Director General in the ministry of culture. Because of material
reasons, he received no formal education, but read avidly. His sensitive
poetry is dedicated to the Palestinian cause. He has published several
collections of poetry. He was awarded the 1998 Palestine Award for Poetry.</font>
