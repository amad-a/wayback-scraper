<dl><b>Intensive Care Unit</b>
<br>I whirl with the wind as the earth narrows before me. I would fly off
and rein in the wind, but I am human.. I felt a million flutes tear at
my breast. Coated with ice I saw my grave carried on my palms. I disintegrated
over the bed. Threw up. Lost consciousness for a while. Died. Cried out
before that short-lived death occurred: I love you, shall I enter into
death through your feet? And I died.. I was completely extinguished. How
serene death is except for your weeping! And how tranquil if it wasn't
for your hands pounding my breasts to have me return. I loved you before
and after death, and between the two I saw only my mother's face.
<p>It was the heart that strayed for a while, and then returned. I ask
my love: In which heart was I struck? She bent over me and covered my question
with a tear. O heart... heart, how is it you lied to me and disrupted my
climax ?
<dt>
We have plenty of time, heart , stabilize</dt>
<dt>
So that a hoopoe bird may fly to you from the land of <i>Balqis</i> (Yemen).</dt>
<dt>
We have sent letters.</dt>
<dt>
We have crossed thirty seas and sixty coast lines</dt>
<dt>
and still there is time in life for greater wanderings.</dt>
<dt>
And O heart, how is it that you lied to a mare that never tires of the
winds. Hold on so we can complete this final embrace and kneel in worship.
Hold on..hold on. Let me find out if you are my heart or her voice crying:
Take me.</dt>
<dd>
<b>Psalm 9</b></dd>
<br>O rose beyond the reach of time and of the senses
<dt>
O kiss enveloped in the scarves of all the winds</dt>
<dt>
surprise me with one dream</dt>
<dt>
that my madness will recoil from you</dt>
<dt>
Recoiling from you</dt>
<dt>
In order to approach you</dt>
<dt>
I discovered time</dt>
<dt>
Approaching you</dt>
<dt>
in order to recoil from you</dt>
<dt>
I discovered my senses</dt>
<dt>
Between approach and recoil</dt>
<dt>
there is a stone the size of a dream</dt>
<dt>
It does not approach</dt>
<dt>
It does not recoil</dt>
<dt>
You are my country</dt>
<dt>
A stone is not what I am</dt>
<dt>
therefore I do not like to face the sky</dt>
<dt>
nor do I die level with the ground</dt>
<dt>
but I am a stranger, always a stranger</dt>

<b>I am from There:</b></dt>
<p><br>I come from there and remember,
<br>I was born like everyone is born, I have a mother
<br>and a house with many windows,
<br>I have brothers, friends and a prison.
<br>I have a wave that sea-gullls snatched away.
<br>I have a view of my own and an extra blade of grass.
<br>I have a moon past the peak of words.
<br>I have the godsent food of birds and an olive tree beyond the ken of
time.
<br>I have traversed the land before swords turned bodies into banquets.
<br>I come from there. I return the sky to its mother when for its mother
the
<br>sky cries, and I weep for a returning cloud to know me.
<br>I have learned the words of blood-stained courts in order to break the
rules.
<br>I have learned and dismantled all the words to construct a single one:
<br>Home

<br><b>Ahmad Al-Za�tar:</b><b></b>
<p>For two hands, of stone and of thyme
<br>I dedicate this song.. For Ahmad, forgotten between two butterflies
<br>The clouds are gone and have left me homeless, and
<br>The mountains have flung their mantles and concealed me
<p>..From the oozing old wound to the contours of the land I descend, and
<br>The year marked the separation of the sea from the cities of ash, and
<br>I was alone
<br>Again alone
<br>O alone? And Ahmad
<br>Between two bullets was the exile of the sea
<br>A camp grows and gives birth to fighters and to thyme
<br>And an arm becomes strong in forgetfulness
<br>Memory comes from trains that have left and
<br>Platforms that are empty of welcome and of jasmine
<br>In cars, in the landscape of the sea, in the intimate nights of prison
cells
<br>In quick liaisons and in the search for truth was
<br>The discovery of self
<br>In every thing, Ahmad found his opposite
<br>For twenty years he was asking
<br>For twenty years he was wandering
<br>For twenty years, and for moments only, his mother gave him birth
<br>In a vessel of banana leaves
<br>And departed
<p>He seeks an identity and is struck by the volcano
<br>The clouds are gone and have left me homeless, and
<br>The mountains have flung their mantles and concealed me
<p>I am Ahmad the Arab, he said
<br>I am the bullets, the oranges and the memory
