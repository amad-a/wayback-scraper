<p><font size="+1"><a href="darwish.jpg">Darwish </a>is considered to be
the most imortant Arab poet working today. He was born in 1942 in the village
of Barweh in the Galilee, which was razed to the ground by the Israelis
in 1948. As a result of his political activism he faced house arrest and
imprisonment. He left Israel in 1971, and lived in exile until his return
in 1996 to Palestine. His poems are known throughout the Arab world, and
several of them have been put to music. His poetry has gained great sophistication
over the years, and has enjoyed international fame for a long time. He
has published around 30 poetry and prose collections, which have been translated
into 35 languages. He is the editor in chief of the prestigious literary
review
<i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001006024530/mailto:carmel@sakakini.org">Al Karmel</a>, </i>which has
resumed publication in January 1997. He published in 1998 his new poetry
collection: <i>Sareer El Ghariba</i> (Bed of the Stranger), his first collection
of love poems</font>
