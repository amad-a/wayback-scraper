        </b>they found him </dt>

    <dt>When they raise his hands </dt>

    <dt>It is said: </dt>
    <dt>wheatstalks bloomed beneath his sleeves. </dt>
    <dt>It is said: </dt>
    <dt>the birds carried his blood </dt>
    <dt>to his beloved cousins. </dt>
    <dt>He shall return </dt>
    <dt>Blossoming with volcanoes, </dt>
    <dt>and fill again his mother's breasts. </dt>
    <dt>When they found him green as light </dt>

    <dt>they spread out the sky to lay him on </dt>
