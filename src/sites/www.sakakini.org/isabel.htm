was born in 1963 in Germany to a German mother and a Peruvian father .

<p><font size="3">She worked in Sudan and Egypt with NBC News , and acquired
experience in news photograpy . She then worked as a freelance jounalist
for Deutsche-Welle TV , and as a photo editor for the European Press Agency
in Frankfurt . Isabel also attended two courses at the Maine photographic
workshops to fine tune her skills in black and white photography and in
printing processes . Isabel has focused on photography in the last two
years , her first project was the publication of a 1996 black and white
calendar entitled <i>Palestiniana</i> containing photographs of palestinians
, the West Bank and Gaza from a non-news perspective. At the same time,
she completed a slide and music show by the same title which was screened
at the <i>Wasiti</i> Arts Center in April 1996. She held her first solo
exhibit in Jerusalem in May 1996. Of her work she says: "I wanted
to crysllise all the positive aspects of Palestinian culture, tradition,
and history through consciously beautiful photography as a counter-balance
to the grim realities of the day". </font></p>
