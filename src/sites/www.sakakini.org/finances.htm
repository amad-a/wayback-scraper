<p><b><font size="+1">FINANCES:</font></b>
<p><font size="+1">Current sources of revenue are: donations, project-specific
grants, members� dues, partial coverage of overhead costs by the Carmel
literary quarterly, and ticket sales from events held at the Centre.</font>
<p><font size="+1">The Sakakini�s first funding priority after its change
of status is to establish an endowment fund to enable it to pursue its
activities in financial security, and constitute a funding base for future
cultural support initiatives in Palestine.</font>
<p><font size="+1">If you would like to financially support the work of the
Centre, and if you live or have a bank account in the US, you can make
a tax-free contribution to the Sakakini by:</font>
<p><font size="+1">1- Writing a check to: ADCRI/KSCC</font>

<br><font size="+1">KSCC/ADC Fund,</font>
<br><font size="+1">6204 Sotol Cove</font>
<br><font size="+1">Austin, Texas 78759, USA.</font>
<p><font size="+1">The Washington based Arab-American Anti-Discrimination
Committee (ADC) is kindly lending us their support in this endeavor by
making us benefit from their tax free status. After receipt of the check,
the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010429182948/http://www.adc.org/">ADC</a>&nbsp; will then mail you a tax-free
contribution receipt. A non profit foundation, ADCRI is exempt from taxation
under section 501(C)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Contributions
to the ADCRI/KSCC fund are tax deductible to the extent provided by law.
