        delivered the Opening Speech. Dr. El-Sarraj raised the concern that
        ongoing political tensions led the Israeli government to reject travel

        holding an Israeli identity card (please see forthcoming press

        >During his speech, Dr. El-Sarraj referred to the nascent experience of
        Palestinian democracy and the ongoing struggle in securing respect for
        Palestinian human rights. He emphasized the need for Palestinians to
        press ahead with building democracy and strengthening dialogue with the
        Palestinian Authority (PA). In concluding, Dr. El-Sarraj expressed his
        gratitude and appreciation for all those who supported him in 1996 when
        he was arrested by the PA. He described the experience as painful, but
        as opening the road to a more meaningful dialogue with the PA which has
        led to advancements in the human rights situation.</font

        ><b>Dr. Kamal El-Shrafi</b>, head of the Monitoring and Ethics Committee
        of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) raised the question of how
        Palestinians can move from backwardness and subordination and toward
        pluralism and democracy. He expressed his concern over the internal and
        external pressures recently exerted on the PA to take certain measures
        thought to advance peace and development. According to El-Shrafi, such
        pressures have resulted in the PA resorting to arbitrary arrests and
        severe interrogation methods which have led to death. El-Shrafi insisted
        that the PA, while not a fully sovereign state, must abide by
        international standards of human rights.</font

      <font color="#000066"
        >El-Shrafi detailed the close relationship between health and human
        rights and community development and poverty alleviation. Poverty exerts
        a destructive impact on health and human rights which cannot be ignored.
        With 70 percent of the Palestinian population living in poverty, Dr.
        El-Shrafi asserted that it is imperative to meet basic human needs
        through employment, housing, and personal security. Furthermore,
        freedom, human rights, and democracy are vital not just for the
        community, but as a base for the development process itself. The
        national government ought to show a strong commitment to democratic
        institutions, protect human rights and active political participation of
        the people, and ascertain the rule of law, transparency, and
        accountability.</font

        >El-Shrafi further declared the importance of women<font size="-1"
          >‘</font
        >s rights. Palestinian society must move forward on two legs, with equal
        rights for women, or risk becoming unbalanced. The needs of Palestinian
        children must also be given prime attention because of the difficult
        conditions in which they grew up during the Intifada. Such children need
        support in their rehabilitation efforts.</font

    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066"
        >Dr. El-Shrafi forcefully condemned Israeli occupation policies which
        have systematically violated Palestinian human rights on an individual
        and collective level. International condemnation has been impeded by
        U.S. vetoes. Despite the Madrid conference and the subsequent
        agreements, Israel continues to violate Palestinian human rights.
        Israeli torture of Palestinians has resulted in deaths and the Israeli
        High Court of Justice has gone far in condoning startling violations of
        basic rights.</font

          Rights</i
        >. Dr. Fine asserted that over 1<font size="-1">&amp;frac12;</font>
        billion people are suffering from degrading poverty throughout the world
        and that some of them could be found only one or two kilometers from the
        conference site. There is an arrogant policy of governments around the
        world to neglect the poor. Genocides rage uncontrolled throughout the
        world and the Vatican speaks of an ice-cold indifference to the
        unprecedented abyss of death in Algeria where approximately 100,000
        deaths have occurred in the past five years. Despite the many problems
        throughout the world, Dr. Fine asserted that there are things that
        health professionals and conference participants can do to make an
        effective difference.</font

    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066"
        >First, health professionals and conference participants should support
        every national health professional group committed to advancing human
        rights. Second, participants must demonstrate unity and strength in
        asserting the universality of their deepest beliefs, while maintaining
        the importance of individual identities and cultures. Third,
        participants must let the world community know what their vision is.
        Fourth, participants must consider what form the effort for human rights
        will take. Such a world movement can advance health professionals
        everywhere and put an end to economic exploitation and
        discrimination.</font

        be abandoned, but that human rights advocates will also not retreat or
        succumb. Dr. Shourafa asserted that the President would make every

        jumping towards each other with the U.S. serving as the safety net. She
        asserted that the safety net would probably not work as effectively for
        Palestinian leaders plunging to their doom as it would for Israeli
        leaders. She asserted that while the Jewish lobby, particularly AIPAC,
        has strength in the United States, the real reasons for U.S. policies
        result from geo-political considerations in which the U.S. seeks to
        control the flow of resources and the selling of arms. She also
        expressed concern over the role of U.S. evangelicals in the development
        of U.S. policy to the region.</font

        the Intifada along the lines of what the African National Congress did
        at a similar historicaljuncture. Instthe Palestinian leadership has
        suffered under a succof policy retreats by the U.S. government. She
        expressed concern that the U.S. now sees itself as managing a process in
        which everything is linked to Israeli security requirements and in
        keeping the talks going rather than in working toward the fulfillment of
        agreements. In conclusion she did express some hope that Europe would

        avoiding the absorption of 2 million Palestinians. Rabin<font size="-1"
          >‘</font
        >s separation policy created three Palestinian cantons with a fourth
        canton in Jericho. With separation Israel found a way to draw away from
        the Palestinian people without drawing away from the land. Oslo II has
        had the effect of enclosing and dissecting Palestinian territory. In
        conclusion, she asserted that Palestinians are not free so long as
        Israel controls the borders and so long as Israeli security concerns are
        placed on a higher ethical plane than Palestinian freedom and

        >In the afternoon, six workshops were held. The first session was on
        <b>Medical Ethics: The Case of Israel. Dr. Derek Summerfield</b> of the
        Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture set the framework
        for discussion with his presentation on
        <i>Medical Ethics: The Case of the Israeli Medical Association</i>. He
        argued first that in Israel torture has become a state policy. The
        policy is so bureaucratized that doctors approach torture in a routine
        manner. In such a state medical workers are forced to choose between the
        role of health worker and citizen. Israel has chosen a version of
        citizenship in which security concerns override medical responsibility.
        Secondly, Summerfield argued that Israel has violated medical neutrality
        in restricting the movement of medical workers and stalling the sick and
        dying at checkpoints. <b>Dr. Ruchama Marton</b> of Physicians for Human
        Rights in her speech on The Israeli Weltanschaung and Government
        Policies <font size="-1">–</font> The Duty of Intervention and
        <b>Dr. Kamal El-Shrafi</b> in his presentation on Medical Ethics: The
        Case of Khalid Abu Da<font size="-1">’</font>ya added their voices to
        Summerfield<font size="-1">‘</font>s arguments. Marton said that the
        idea of total separation, which has won support among the Israeli
        policy-makers, has only succeeded in retaining a hold on Palestinian
        land while dehumanizing the Palestinian people. El-Shrafi added an
        emotional force to the indictments. He showed a film in which medical
        workers examine the body of Khalid Abu Da<font size="-1">’</font>ya and
        display his very visible marks of torture. In the questioning session,
        <b>Rami Heilbronn</b> of the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims
        of Torture, UK, said that the absence of Israeli Medical Association
        head Eran Dolev must be made into a presence. Dolev canceled his
        appearance at the conference only one day before it began, citing
        <font size="-1">“</font>very serious pressure.<font size="-1">”</font>
        Quoting Albert Einstein and Bertrand Russell, Heilbronn said,<font
          size="-1"
          >”</font
        >Remember your humanity and forget the rest<font size="-1">”</font>. He
        then said, <font size="-1">“</font>Eran Dolev cannot forget the
        rest<font size="-1">”</font>. Summerfield then made a motion to draft a
        letter addressed to Dolev, in which he would put all the questions posed
        in the workshop to Dolev directly.</font

        Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the
        Environment spoke on
        <i>Human Rights Violations under the Palestinian Authority</i>. In
        arguing that the PA has observed an explicit and clear policy to
        disregard the guarantees and assurances of international law Shkirat
        sounded a note echoed and re-echoed by Mr. Raji Sourani and Dr.
        El-Sarraj. Each catalogued a long list of human rights violations
        perpetrated by the PA, then struggled with how to maintain loyalty to
        the major representative institution of the Palestinian people while
        remaining true to the dream of a civil and democratic society. In his
        talk, <i>Mental Health and Human Rights Challenges in Palestine</i>, Dr.
        El-Sarraj struggled with how the dream of a free and independent state
        had devolved into a state with authoritarian tendencies. As Mr. Sourani
        said in his presentation on
        <i>Palestinian Human Rights: The Reality and Challenge, </i>people have
        nothing to lose, and only become perplexed at the discrepancy between
        the political rhetoric and the daily reality. All three, however, cited
        the continuing Israeli occupation as a major obstacle to Palestinian
        democracy. Yet despite the deteriorating conditions all three affirmed
        their commitment to a civil and democratic society, even if that
        commitment means criticizing the PA.</font

        should be sent outside of Gaza to gain more knowledge of Forensic
        Psychiatry. 2) Institutions should be established for mental health
        patients who have committed crimes so that they are not imprisoned with
        the general prison population. 3) Specialized laws should be established
        to deal with those patients who commit crimes.</font
