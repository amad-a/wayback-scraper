    <br />The Sixth International Research and Advisory Panel (IRAP) Conference
    on Forced Migration has begun at the Ambassador Hotel in Jerusalem.&nbsp;
    The event has been convened under the auspices of the International
    Association for the Study of Forced Migration (IASFM) and is organized by
    the Gaza Community Mental Health Program. <br />This morning's plenary
    session included addresses by Dr. Art Hansen of Clark Atlanta University,
    President of the IASFM, H.E. Faisel El-Husseini, PNA Minister for Jerusalem
    Affairs, and Mr. Husam El-Nounou, GCMHP Public Relations Coordinator, on
    behalf of Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj and the GCMHP. <br />Dr. Hansen welcomed the
    participants, thanked the staff of GCMHP for their dedication in organizing
    the conference over the past year, and in particular for their extraordinary
    efforts in the last week after the conference itself became a victim of
    forced migration from Gaza to Jerusalem in anticipation of US President Bill
    Clinton's trip to Palestine.&nbsp; Dr. Hansen also outlined the history and
    goals of IASFM, WHICH ORIGINATED SOME EIGHT YEARS AGO AS A SELECT PANEL OF
    ACADEMICS BROUGHT TOGETHER TO ADVISE Oxford's Refugee Studies Program.&nbsp;
    Within a few years, the small panel had grown into a full conference, and
    this new status was formalized as the IRAP Conference on Forced
    Migration.&nbsp; The first four IRAPs wee held in Oxford, England.&nbsp; It
    was then decided that future conferences should be held in refugee-affected
    countries, and the fifth IRAP was held at Moi University in Eldoret,
    Kenya.&nbsp; The choice of Gaza as the site for the sixth IRAP was informed
    by the same desire.&nbsp; Dr. Hansen said that the goals of IASFM are
    twofold: to strive for a better understanding of the phenomenon of forced
    migration and to work to develop better practices and policies for dealing
    with forced migration and its consequences.&nbsp; He concluded by reminding
    the participants that 'experts' are simply ordinary people who are a long
    way from home.&nbsp; They have not come here to teach or preach, but rather
    to learn. <br />Mr. El-Nounou also welcomed all participants to Palestine,
    and expressed great disappointment that it had not been possible to hold the
    conference in Gaza as planned.&nbsp; He especially lamented the fact that so
    many people in Gaza who had devoted their time and energy preparing for the
    conference would not be able to see the result of their work.&nbsp; But the
    relocation of the conference, he pointed out, is simply a further example of
    the kind of realities that Palestinians face in their lives every day.&nbsp;
    Mr. El-Nounou then read a message from Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj, Director of
    GCMHP, who wished the participants the best for their four days of work, and
    said he hoped to join them soon.&nbsp; Dr. El-Sarraj noted that GCMHP
    conferences in Gaza seem to correspond with historical events: the first
    GCMHP international conference took place at the same time as the signing of
    the Oslo Accords in Washington, and this conference marks the first visit by
    a US President to Palestinian territory. <br />H.E. Faisel El-Husseini, PNA
    Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, then delivered an effective and emotionally
    potent historical summary on the treatment and living conditions of
    Palestinians in Jerusalem.&nbsp; He emphasized how important it is for
    international conferences of this type to take place in Palestine, as Israel
    goes to great lengths to keep these issues far from the public eye.&nbsp; He
    explained how the disasters of 1948 included the removal of
    30,000Palestinians from West to East Jerusalem, the transfer of the
    Palestinian capital from Jerusalem to Amman, and the occupation of
    Palestinian villages surrounding Jerusalem, cutting off the land from its
    capital, a fact that has had severe economic and social consequences for
    both Jerusalem and the West Bank.&nbsp; These events were followed by
    further disasters in 1967: the occupation and annexation of Jerusalem and
    the West Bank by Israel.&nbsp; The fact that this happened in June
    compounded the disaster because so many Palestinians were outside the city
    working, and many were not permitted by the Israelis to return after severe
    restrictions were place on Palestinian residency rights in Jerusalem.&nbsp;
    He then detailed the devastating effects of Israel's land and building
    policy in Jerusalem, and the inherent unfairness in Israel's policies
    governing who has the right to reside in Jerusalem.&nbsp; The situation has
    not improved after the signing of the Oslo accords, as Israel has continued
    its policies of physical, social, and economic isolation.&nbsp; Jerusalem,
    in fact, can be thought of as one big refugee camp because all Palestinians
    here at least psychologically feel like refugees.&nbsp; His remarks se the
    tone for the conference. <br />After the plenary sessions, the conference
    broke up into three workshops: Palestinian Diaspora; Refugees and Refugee
    Policy in the Great Lakes Region; and Refugee Children and Psychosocial
    Care. <br />Ms. Christine Pirinoli-Ahmed began the workshop on the
    Palestinian Diaspora and discussed the collective memory of Palestinians
    from the village of Barbara who live in the Gaza Strip.&nbsp; She talked
    about how people from Barbara represent their refugee status to themselves,
    and how they pass their identity as Barbarawi on to their children.&nbsp;
    She remarked how one man she interviewed for her research told her that he
    wanted to 'plant his homeland in the hearts of his children before dying',
    so that his children or grandchildren might be able to return there, even if
    he could not.&nbsp; Mr. Blair van Dyke of Brigham Young University in Utah,
    USA, reported on his research on education in Gaza.&nbsp; He said that
    centuries of foreign control over Palestinian education by the Ottoman
    Empire, Britain, and now Israel, has resulted in a lack of democracy in
    Palestinian society, even though democracy is a core value of Palestinian
    culture.&nbsp; He recommended that authority structures be removed from
    schools, and that students be taught to think critically rather than
    memorize by rote.&nbsp; Finally, Ms. Elham Bayour of the Amnesty
    International Women's Rights Committee in California, USA, delivered an
    impassioned speech on the desperate conditions of Palestinian refugees in
    Lebanon that left a deep impact on the audience.&nbsp; She described how
    Palestinian refugees are discriminated against both officially by the
    Lebanese government, which refuses to grant work permits for all but the
    most menial fobs and does not offer social services to Palestinians, as well
    as by ordinary Lebanese, who are encourage to believe that Palestinians are
    dirty and lazy.&nbsp; Her remarks were all the more forceful because Ms.
    Bayour herself is a Palestinian from Lebanon who grew up in refugee camps
    there. <br />The workshops on Refugees and Refugee Policy in the Great Lakes
    Region included presentations by Ms. Monica Kathina Juma of Pembroke
    College, Oxford, England on The Fallacy of participatory Emergency Response:
    The Case of Agency Relations during Emergencies in Kenya and Uganda; Mr.
    Pierre-Claver Ngezahayo on Forced Displacement and Resettlement in the Great
    Lakes Region; and Mr. Duncan Ngare of Moi University, Eldoret, Kenya on
    Health Nutritional Status of Refugees: Case Study of Kukuma Camp, Kenya.
    <br />The workshop on Refugee Children and Psychosocial Care consisted of
    talks by Jumana Odeh, Dr. Maryanne Loughry of the Refugee Studies Program,
    Oxford, England, and Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj, GCMHP, on A Child-Centered Approach
    to Investigating Refugee Children's Concerns; by Mladen Knezevic on
    Creativity: A potential danger to psychotraumatized children; and by
    Professor A. Nweze on Refugee Children in Africa: Psychological Impact and
    Issues Involved. <br />The conference continues in the afternoon with
    workshops on Information about Forced Migration studies; Sudanese Refugees
    and Internally Displaced Persons; and Internal Forced Migration and
    Displacement.&nbsp; The first workshop has a talk by Dr. Marilyn Deegan of
    the Refugee Studies Program, Oxford on the Refugee Studies Program Digital
    Library, as well as informational films by BADIL and GCMHP. <br />The
    workshop on Sudanese refugees featured presentations by Benaiah Nyaing Duku
    of the American University in Cairo on Redefining Gender roles and Relations
    in Exile: The Case of Sudanese Exiles in Northern Uganda and Displaced
    Persons in Southern Sudan.&nbsp; Mr. Duku also gave a talk on sex and
    Marriage in the Midst of Civil War and Refugee Life: The Case of Southern
    Sudanese in Exile and Internally Displaced Persons.&nbsp; Mr. Lee Samuel
    Lamua talked about the Current Situation of the Forced Sudanese Migrants,
    Refugees, and Internally Displaced Persons: The Case of the Sudanese
    Refugees and Internally Displaced Sudanese in SPLM/A Controlled Areas of the
    Southern Sudan.&nbsp; Mr. Michael Abat Elikana reported on Ethnic Relations:
    The Case of the Sudanese Refugee in Northern Uganda, the Democratic Republic
    on Congo and Internally Displaced Persons in the SPML/A Controlled Areas of
    Southern Sudan. <br />Heloisa Szymanski of the Pontifical Catholic
    University of Sao Paulo gave the final workshop on internal forced
    migration.&nbsp; She talked on Community Development through educational
    Projects: Internal Migrants from Northeastern Brazil in Sao Paulo.
    <br />Moreover, conference participants enjoyed a two-hour tour of Jerusalem
    in the evening.&nbsp; They visited the Mount of Olives, the Buraq Wall, and
    Qalandia refugee camp.
