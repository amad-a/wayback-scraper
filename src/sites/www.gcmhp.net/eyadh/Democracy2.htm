          >An American science-fiction movie tells the story of a spaceship that
          sends some “experts” to subdue an American town as a prelude to taking
          over the world. The invaders from space intend to subdue the town by
          injecting into the human beings a drug that spreads to all body cells,
          preserving their intelligence but transforming them into robot-like
          beings controlled by electronic signals from the aliens’ command
          center. The first task of every person injected is to recruit his
          wife, kids, and friends.</font

        >In this science-fiction horror movie, we see how individuals begin
        spying on their relatives and friends and sending regular reports to
        their masters. The irony is that the town maintains the appearance of
        stability and civilization and democratic elections are held despite the
        predetermined results.</font

        >As one follows the movie, a comparison of events on the screen and
        reality leads to a sense of astonishment and fear. In our world, regimes
        do not inject people with a drug, but skillfully subdue their subjects.
        People just looking out for their livelihood are controlled by rulers
        who threaten their life means. If this is not enough, then the regime
        uses wealth or status to command its subjects.</font

        >Thus, intellectuals, human rights activist, and key opposition figures
        are into ministerial posts, co-opted under the justification of
        “building from within.” Then people see yesterday’s symbols of justice
        and conscience as today’s decorated ministers and defenders of the
        regime.</font

        >We hear stories of university professors trapped between losing their
        promotion or paying homage to the regime; of the Dean who remains close
        to the regime regardless of any academic, scientific, or cultural
        considerations. A professor in an Arab university told me that, under
        threat of being dismissed, arrested, or charged with plotting a coup, he
        is prohibited from speaking to the President of the University because
        the administration found out that he brings up political matters in his
        conversations.</font

        >Another professor told me that his students write reports of his
        “political corruption”, his sympathy with the opposition. Another that
        he could talk politics only in the street because the state security
        used the automatic memory in his fax machine as proof of his writings
        and correspondence critical of the regime. A writer once told me that
        the “system” confronted him with pictures and recordings of a
        relationship he had with a lady. Afterwards, he dutifully wrote his
        reports and stopped talking about politics for fear of a scandal.</font

        few years and cast their votes in presidential and parliamentary
        elections with all the hype. Simultaneously, prison cells fill with
        opposition figures and free thinkers.</font
