<b><font color="#000066">ABSTRACT:</font></b>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">This study is based on field research
work to estimate the level of anxiety among the Palestinian people in Gaza
Strip, as a measure of the effect of stress. In comparison with a similar
study which was conducted in 1984, significant differences were observed
in the level of anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms and rigidity and significant
rise of anxiety among the citizens of Gaza. The refugee camps however did
not show any signigicant changes.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">THE PROBLEM:</font></b>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">For over 25 years of Israeli military
occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank the Palestinian community has
been subjected to live in a chronically stressful environment.</font>
</p><div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">750,000 Palestinian live in Gaza Strip,
two thirds of them are refugees who left their original homes in Palestine
(now Israel) in 1948. 350,000 of them are housed in eight refugee camps.
57,937 are living in Gaza town and 20,000 were resettled in 1985 in new
buildings as part of the Israeli government policy of resettling the Palestinian
refugees.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">In December 1987, the Palestinian
uprising (Intifada) erupted as a spontaneous mass civil movement against
the continuation of the occupation. The Israeli reaction was characterized
by harsh measures which included detention without trial, shooting to kill
policy, house raids, and torture (Amnesty International 1992).</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Samir Quta- a coauther presneted a
dissertation for the degree of M.A. psychology based on field research
to Ein Shams University in 1984. The results showed significant differences
in the level of anxiety between four groups; the camp refugees, the town
refugees, the resettled refugees and the citizens of Gaza (Qouta 1985)
The camps refugees then scored the highest on all the tests. In this present
study the same work is repeated by using only TMAS in order to find answers
to the following questions :</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">1. Did the events of the Intifada
produce a new level of anxiety among the Palestinian population in Gaza
Strip?</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">2. What are the differences - if any
- in the level of anxiety between the four groups?</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><b><u><font color="#000066">Methodology:</font></u></b></div>
<font color="#000066">&nbsp;</font>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">1. <b><u>The Sample:</u></b></font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;A sample of 160 people (80 males,
80 females) were randomly selected to represent the four groups:</font></div>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">a. <b>Camp Refugees:</b> N=40, age 23.2
+ 1.7</font>
</p><div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">b.<b> Re-settled refugees: </b>N=40,
age 22.5 +.1.9</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">c.<b> Town refugees:</b> N=40, age
22.5 + 1.15</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">d. <b>Citizens:</b> N=40, age 21 +
1.8</font></div>
&nbsp;
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The sample was selected from the middle
social class and 50% of the sample were females in each group.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font color="#000066">2. <b><u>The Hypothesis:</u></b></font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">a. The four groups are expected to
show higher degree of anxiety in comparison to that in 1984.</font>
<br><font color="#000066">b. Camp and resettled refugee are expected to
show higher degree of anxiety if compared to town refugees and citizens
of Gaza following the events of the Intifada.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">3.<b> <u>Tools:</u></b></font></p></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">A battery of six tests that measure
anxiety degree from different aspects were employed:</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">a. <b>Friendship test:</b></font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">This test consists of 70 qualities
that people like or don't to be attributes of their friends. Every participant
was asked to decide in degrees the extent he/she prefers or rejects these
qualities:</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;- (+2) is the degree given to
qualities that are essential for friendship.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;- (+1) is the degree given to
qualities that are preferable.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;- (0) is the degree given to
qualities that are of no significance to friendship.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;- (-1) is the degree given to
qualities that are undesired.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;- (-2) is the degree given to
qualities that are anethma to friendship.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The reliability of this test was found
to be between 0.6 to 0.85 by many workers. (Souif 1968)</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"><b>b.</b> <b>The psychosomatic symptoms
test:</b></font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Consists of 14 psychosomatic symptoms.
Each participant is asked to mark the item which he/she feels it corresponds
with his/her state of health. (Inkles &amp; Smith 1976)</font></div>
<p><b><font color="#000066">c. Taylor manifest anxiety scale: (TMAS)</font></b>
<br><font color="#000066">This is a questionnaire of 50 sentences each
describes certain type of behavior or symptom. (Souif 1976).</font>
<br><b><font color="#000066">d. Rigidity tests:</font></b>
</p><p><b><font color="#000066">1. The triangle-circle test:</font></b>
</p><p><font color="#000066">It consists of eight cards, the first has a picture
of a triangle that gradually changes on other cards to a full circle.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000066">The score of this test is measured by the number
of answers the participant continues to see only a triangle with no further
addition. (Hefni 1971)</font>
</p><p><b><font color="#000066">2. The cat-dog test:</font></b>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;It consists of eight cards, the
first has a picture of a cat that gradually changes to be a dog in the
last one.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The degree of this test is measured
by the number of answers the participant continues to see only a cat with
no further addition. (Ibid 1971).</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">3. The tree house test:</font></b>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">It consists of eight cards, the first
has a picture of a tree that gradually changes to a house in the last card.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The degree in this test is measured
by the number of answers the participant continues to see only a tree with
no further addition. (Ibid 1971).</font>
</p><div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">These tests are modified form of Zazlo's
test that measure perceptional rigidity through the resistance to realizing
gradual changes. (Hefni 1971)</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">There is a general agreement that
high degrees of rigidity reflect a state of anxiety. (Cowen 1952, French
1955, Farraj 1971)</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><b><u><font color="#000066">Results:</font></u></b></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Statistical analysis revealed the
following results:</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">1. The level of anxiety as measured
by TMAS and psychosomatic symptoms have increased among the citizens compared
to their previous state in 1984. The difference is significant at (P=&gt;.05).</font></div>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">2. There were no significant differences
in all the three groups of refugees in the tests of friendship, psychosomatic
and TMAS between 1984 and 1991. However camp refugee scored higher than
their score in 1984 score on rigidity tests (tree-home, triangle-circle,
dog-cat) with significance at (p&gt;.01). Resettled and town refugees scored
lower than their score in 1984 on rigidity tests (tree-home, dog-cat) with
significance at (P=&gt;.01). (Table 1)</font>
</p><div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">3. Comparison of the level of anxiety
between the four groups in 1991 revealed the following observations:</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;a. The psychosomatic symptoms
were higher among the resettled than the other groups with significance
at (P=&gt;.05).</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">b. Anxiety level as tested by TMAS
show higher scores of the resettled refugees and the camp refugees than
the two other groups with significance at (P=&gt;.05).</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">c. Camp refugees scored higher on
the tests which measure tension through rigidity (dog-cat, tree-house)
in comparison with other groups with significance of (P=&gt;.01).</font></div>

<font color="#000066">&nbsp;</font>
<div dir="LTR"><b><u><font color="#000066">Discussion</font></u></b></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Many observers agree that the spontaneous
eruption of the Intifada has acted as a therapeutic process for many social
and psychological problems which were manifested in the Palestinian community
(El Sarraj 1988). Indeed, the Intifada is viewed as being the most dramatic
political upheaval in the history of the Palestinian - Israeli conflict
which affected both sides of the conflict.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The Israeli occupation policies before
the Intifada were behind the clear high level of anxiety among the Palestinians
in our first study in 1984. In that study there was a clear difference
in the level of anxiety among the four groups of the population with the
highest level between the camp refugees and the resettled. The camp refugees
are subjected to a style of life and environment which is different from
the kind of life the citizen enjoy. The refugees harbor a deep feeling
of insecurity which transmits through generations following their uprooting
in 1948. Their life in an overcrowded camps, in poor environment, and low
standard of living have added to their frustration, humiliation, and resentment.
Little wonder why did the Intifada start in these refugee camps.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">In our recent study we found that
the anxiety level has generally increased in the four groups (as shown
in table 2) following the events of the Intifada with significantly higher
levels of anxiety among the camp refugees and the resettled groups than
in the citizens and the town refugees. These two areas are in fact the
site of continuous confrontations. Almost every house was raided , most
adults were arrested , detained or injured. The Palestinian refugees in
these two areas in keeping the flames of the Intifada are heavily punished
for that.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">We also found that the anxietylevel
among the citizen group, although still lower than in the camp refugees,
was significantly higher if compared to their level in 1984.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">This phenomenon can be probably explained
in two ways :</font></div>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">On one hand, it seems that the active
involvement in the Intifada has allowed the camp refugees to release all
feelings of anger and frustration outwardly. In contrast, the relatively
protected citizens - mostly middle class families - lagged behind and participated
less in the activities of the Intifada and in most cases were left to hear
and witness from a distance what was occurring in the refugee camps. This
explanation goes along with Lewin tension system theory and Maslow theory
(El Mola 1976, Hilgard 1975)) which proposes that human beings always try
to minimize the tension through various forms of activity.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">This group of people then were captives
to their fear and anxiety for which they found no outlet. In consequence
we expect that there will be more behavioral antisocial problems in this
group.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Again, it seems that the social support
system was more available to the communities of the camp refugees through
the close family and tribal structure and through the newly formed groups
of activists. This corresponds with the studies of social support and stress
through protection (Broun, Harris 1978, Eaton 1978, Nucholls, Cassell,
Kaplan 1972, Wheely 1982, Wilox 1981) and through lessening of the effects
of stress (Brown, Harris 1978, Core 1978, House, McMichael, Wells, Kaplan,
Landerman 1979, Kessler, Essex 1980, Husaini 1982).</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">DISCUSSION:</font></b>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Looking to table (2), we obseve that
refugees sometimes got higher scores than citizen , however it is not fair
to do comparison between citizen and refugees , here some questions appeared.
Can we consider Palestinian in the camps as a refugee after 44 years of
their migration? . Can we say that they adapted to the new environment?
Memories of lost home and property left behind and the social upheaval
that accompanied their flight are indelibly attached in the refugees mind.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">For the Palestinian the past also recorded
in legal documents like land registration.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Palestinian refugees still introduce
themselves from their country in Palestinian.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Similar experiences have been reported
of other refugees , Harshen has shown that Greeks evaluated from Asia in
1920 still consider themselves refugees , although they returned to their
mother country (Emanuel Marx).</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Baskauskas 1981 described the grief
felt by lithuanians in American after 40 years of their exile , as the
traumatic experience can not be forgotten (Ibid).</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">However what we must take in our consideration
that the migration of Palestinian people is completely different from other
migration in history , it was up-rooting for the Palestinian who fled or
were expelled to neighboring arab countries , and the results are 2,2 million
Palestinian refugees of whom 770,000 living in camps.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Walsh 1979 said that migration has self
and symbolic implications (Walsh, 1977).</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Also Ross emphasized on the social and
political aspects of migration (Rossi ,1977).</font>
