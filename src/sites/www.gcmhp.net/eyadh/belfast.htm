      <font color="#000066"
        >During the violent days of the Intifada , I was told by a PLO official,
        on one of my visits to Tunis, that he was concerned about the damage
        being done to the national spirit of the struggle by the portrayal of
        our heroic Palestinian children as victims. At the same time, back in
        Gaza, I still had to deal with the Israeli occupation authorities who
        were accusing me of using children and their alleged trauma for
        political propaganda.</font
      >
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066"
        >There is no doubt in my mind that life as we lived it was a political
        issue. Living under occupation makes any one politically involved. Not
        only the politics of the deadly confrontation between Israel and the
        PLO, but also inter partisan politics were exerting their pressure on my
        work. It was difficult to form a board of directors with the agreement
        of all political streams. It was difficult enough to get the
        representatives of the spectrum to meet, let alone to agree on anything.
        Each party was mainly concerned about its slice of power, and sought to
        monopolise power, sometimes through intimidation or even brute force.
        One example was when my drug- addict patients were threatened by Hamas,
        to either stop taking drugs at once or be killed. Some were killed,
        despite my attempt to save them.</font
      >
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066"
        >And since everyone loves children, it was argued that these patients
        were killed for the sake of protecting children from their bad
        example.</font
      >
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066"
        >How did children become involved in the Intifada? The world watched in
        amazement, seeing youngsters not only confront, but even draw Israeli
        soldiers into battle. More than anybody else, the Israelis themselves
        were desperate to know the answer; their self perception was suffering,
        and their image in the eyes of the world was being damaged.</font

    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066"
        >In our culture, children are fortunate in not being stigmatised or
        ostracised when they require psychiatric help. For to consult a
        psychiatrist in Gaza can be a risky business. Many people still believe
        that mental illness is a form of bewitchment or evil possession. One
        curious phenomenon that emerged during the Intifada was the marked
        increase of spiritual healers and fortune tellers, also of those who
        dealt in black magic. People who had become extremely stressed as a
        result of life under occupation went to them, feeling they could provide
        them with magical remedies. After all, people reasoned, what could a
        mere doctor do to help a man possessed by the devil, or a woman under
        the spell of a genie?</font
      >
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066"
        >Fortunately, children were spared such reasoning, and were brought in
        for psychiatric treatment.</font

    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066"
        >Many factors contributed to children involvement in the Intifada. In
        Gaza refugee camps, an average child of twelve will belong to a large
        family, and have at least seven siblings. Living in cramped two roomed
        dwellings, he will spend most of his time outside on the street. There
        he will congregate with his friends. They will do everything together -
        play, eat, fight, sing and weep. Home is an overcrowded space, where
        mother is struggling to make ends meet. Father rises at 3:00 am every
        dawn, to go to work as a laborer in Israel, if, that is he is lucky
        enough to be allowed in across the border that day, and to find work
        once there. This is no small achievement, as unemployment levels for
        Palestinians from Gaza stand at more than 50%. After such a stressful
        day a father will come home that evening so edgy that any thing will
        make him angry. He will often express his frustration by shouting at the
        equally exhausted mother.</font

    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066"
        >One of the first impressions on arriving in Gaza is that it is full of
        children. Half of its one million population are below the age of 15.
        School offers no respite for the children. The majority of schools are
        forced, by economic and demographic pressure, to have two shifts. The
        first shift starts at 7:00 am, its average classroom size numbering 70
        children. In order to cope, teachers tend to be strict disciplinarians,
        who will deliver corporeal punishment during lessons if a child so much
        as gets an answer wrong.</font
      >
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066"
        >The majority of Gaza population are Muslim. Islam for them is a mixture
        of divine rules and cultural traditions, demanding absolute compliance,
        even a fatalistic approach to every day life. Men gain power through
        money and political position. They tend to consider their women and the
        family as a whole to be their exclusive property.</font
      >
    </p>
    <p dir="LTR">
      <font color="#000066"
        >The children of the refugee camps became involved in the Intifada due
        to these conditions. They were being defiant, defending their play
        ground, their territory against the invading Israeli army. They were
        also rebelling against all forms of imposed authority, including that of
        family and teacher. And they were reacting to the sight of the
        humiliation of their fathers, who were helpless when abused or beaten by
        Israeli soldiers. The children were identifying with new symbols of
        power that they saw raging in the streets with new heroes. They were
        magnetised by armed soldiers, and by mysterious masked activists who
        were so daring. If children elsewhere were playing at fiction of wars,
        in Palestine the game was for real. Shootings were with bullets. Bones
        were broken with batons. Tear gas penetrated into every room. Homes were
        dynamited. And blood - real blood - poured off the injured and the
        dead.</font

        lasting from 7:00 pm to 4:00 am. Road blocks were erected everywhere and
        many streets became cull de sacs - Israeli strategic traps to catch
        escaping stone throwers. Mounting tension and violence on the streets
        invaded every home making people increasingly stressed and vulnerable.
        In one of Gaza Community Mental Health Programme (GCMHP) survey we found
        that 12% of the adult population were suffering from severe state of
        anxiety, and 8% with clinical depression.</font

        illusion that children actively expressing defiance were fared better
        than other children. We ultimately were proved wrong. Whilst those
        active children enjoyed a higher sense of self-esteem at the time than
        the rest, this factor did little to protect them from the serious and
        long term effects of trauma.</font

        >Today, with the cessation of daily, armed confrontations - with the
        virtual disappearance of road blocks, and the lifting of curfews -
        Palestinian children are settling back into a normal school routine, a
        routine that had been continuously disrupted by the presence of an
        entrenched occupying army, and by its recent violent clashes with the
        local population during the seven long years of the Intifada. In our
        newest studies, we discovered that among those Palestinian children who
        had actively participated in local celebrations to mark the Israeli army
        withdrawal from the majority of Gaza - celebrations which included the
        raising of the Palestinian flag and the singing of national songs -
        there was a marked reduction in the level of neuroticism.</font

      <font color="#000066"
        >Sof our Palestinian youth, who had been stone-throwing children during
        the Intifada, and had been empowered by such activities, were reluctant
        to see lost that sense of national participation that their Intifada
        role had brought them, and so made the transition to an active role in
        the local electoral process. They became keen voters, throwing their
        ballots in the ballot box with the same determination they had used when
        throwing stones against occupying Israeli soldiers.</font
