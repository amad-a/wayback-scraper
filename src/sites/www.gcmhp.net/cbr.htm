        >On 5 July 1998, GCMHP hosted Dr. David Henley, a Swedish specialist
        working in the Palestinian Solidarity Association in Sweden, to give a
        lecture on “Community Based Rehabilitation” to staff members.</font

      <font color="#000000"
        >In his lecture, Dr. Henley defined rehabilitation and the different
        rehabilitation methods. In addition, he talked about benefiting from
        different social powers such as family and friends to ensure the success
        of the rehabilitation process.</font

    <p>
      <font color="#000000"
        >Dr. Henley also gave two examples of community based rehabilitation.
        The first was on how to use this type of rehabilitation to help people
        suffering from physical handicaps caused by violence. The second example
        was on how to use community based rehabilitation to help those suffering
        from psychological disorders, especially children and teenagers.</font

    <p>
      <font color="#000000"
        >Extensive discussion on this issue followed the lecture. Moreover, it
        was agreed that a group of GCMHP staff members will work to develop a
        community based rehabilitation project. This project will take into
        account benefiting from different powers in society such as parents,
        teachers, school counselors, social workers, and medical professionals
        in order to offer rehabilitation services to the people that
        rehabilitation specialists cannot reach.</font
