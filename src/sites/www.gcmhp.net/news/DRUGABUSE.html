    &nbsp;- Gaza Community Mental Health Programme provided audiovisual aids,

      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Output of the workshops:</li>
    </blockquote>
    &nbsp;1. Fifty five people were trained for community work.
    <br />Each was assigned a mission and conducted at least three inter active
    group meetings with young at risk individuals to affect change of attitude
    towards experimentation with drugs. The young individuals were encouraged to
    enjoy alternative pastimes and activities to use in their leisure time.
    <br />&nbsp;2. Research study will be conducted using RAP (Rapid Assessment
    Procedures) to measure the extent of drug abuse in Palestine. Each
    participant was given 10 handout questionnairs to be completed.
    <br />&nbsp;3. Administrative aspects of the RAP was delegated to Dr. A.
    Afana of the GCMHP who will prepare the computer sheets of the RAP to be
    ready for Prof. El Akabaoui and Dr. Emad Gheith. The research report will be
    worked on during the next visit. Dr. A. Afana was also assigned the
    responsibility of monthly monitoring of field activities to be conducted by
    five trained people.
    <blockquote>
      <li>&nbsp;Evaluation of Training:</li>
    </blockquote>
    There was consensus among participants in each workshop that the training
    was unique and valuable. Participants repeatedly mentioned the wealth of
    information and skills they acquired. An interactive democratic, non
    dictatorial approach grew out of this, which translated into an
    understanding to the needs of this age group. Daily feedback was
    consistently positive concluding&nbsp; with a fast session feedback of being
    grateful and satisfied of what they accomplished during a short&nbsp; period
    compared to what they were used to in previous training they attended.
