      Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj participated in the conference on "The Role of the
      European Commission in the Middle East Peace Process" organized by the
      European Socialists Party on 12 and 13 November.&nbsp; He talked about the
      responsibility of EC countries to actively support the Middle East peace
      process, especially in view of the Israeli Government efforts to abort
      peace.&nbsp; Dr. El-Sarraj stressed European liability stating that Europe
      tortured, killed, and exiled Jews; then, it helped them build a national
      homeland in Palestine at the expense of the original inhabitants of the
      land.&nbsp; Thus Europe has a moral responsibility to help the victim's
      victim.&nbsp; In addition, this supports European geographical, economic,
      and refugee policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, Dr. El-Sarraj stressed the importance of cultural exchange
      between Europe on the one hand and Palestine and Arab countries on the
      other.&nbsp; He also said that if Europe's only concern is the Jews it
      should save Israel from its current government.&nbsp; Dr. El-Sarraj also
      expressed his surprise at the European position in light of the vast
      financial resources that it is investing in the region.&nbsp; He wondered
      if Europe was lacking leadership, unity, or will?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. El-Sarraj also inquired as to how Europe could support a country such
      as Israel, in which the High Court sanctions and legalizes torturing
      Palestinians.&nbsp; How can Europe finance some PA security branches that
      continuously violate human rights?
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to the "Wye Plantation Agreement", Dr. El-Sarraj expressed his
      concern that the implementation of the agreement will be a prelude to
      establishing a police state controlled by the military.&nbsp; He also
      voiced his reservation about CIA involvement in the region in light of its
      long history of ties with dictatorial military regimes.
