        >On May 15 and 16, Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj participated in an International
        Conference on “Health and Human Rights” in Stockholm, Sweden. The
        conference was organized by several Scandinavian human rights
        organizations including Amnesty International, Physicians for Human
        Rights, and others caring for the rights of refugees, asylum seeker, and
        torture survivors. 250 human rights activists from Scandinavia and
        Europe participated.</font

        >Dr. El-Sarraj gave a paper on “Palestinian Human Rights and Mental
        Health” pointing to the fiftieth anniversary of the State of Israel and
        the Palestinian “Nakba” (catastrophe) and uprooting. He stressed that
        the cycle of violence in the Middle East started in Europe with the
        persecution of Jews, who directed their hatred and frustration on a new
        victim (the Palestinian people). Moreover, he talked about the
        systematic Israeli policy of humiliation, torture, and destruction that
        has stripped children of feelings of safety and security and, thus,
        continuing the cycle of violence between the two peoples as well as
        within each individual community. In addition, Dr. El-Sarraj indicated
        that the Israelis tortured about two hundred thousand Palestinians; and
        that, today, thirty thousand still suffer the effects of torture and
        pose a problem to society.</font

        >In his presentation, Dr. El-Sarraj called upon people working in the
        field of rehabilitating torture survivors to raise their voice to stop
        all forms of torture and violence before it occurs. He also encouraged
        the conference participants to call upon Israel to stop its policy of
        settlement building, house demolition, torture, and oppression.</font

      <font color="#000066"
        >Dr. El-Sarraj stated that peace is the only solution to the
        Israeli-Arab conflict. However, peace must be based on justice, the
        guarantee of Palestinian rights, and the establishment of a Palestinian
        State.</font

        Solidarity Association in Sweden in the main square in Stockholm.</font
