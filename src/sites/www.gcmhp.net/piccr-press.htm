          is following with great anxiety the matter of the political detainees
          held in the detention centres of the Palestinian National Authority
          (PNA), who have been protesting their long periods of detention
          without charges, without being presented before a judge, and who are
          deprived of the due process of law. O<i>n t</i>he human side, there
          have been dire consequences as well, in terms of loss of employment or
          their being prevented from completing their studies. Several among
          them have also suffered from untreated illnesses, and all of them have
          felt strongly the denial of rights to which they gave been subjected.
          As a result they have declared an open hunger strike.</font

          >From the time, one week ago, when the political detainees in Jneid
          military prison announced they were going on an open hunger strike,
          the Commission has been getting in constant touch with the Palestinian
          Authority at all levels, demanding that these cases be examined and
          that they be released immediately, particularly as we are approaching
          the 'aid al'adha' (Feast of the Sacrifice).</font

          >The Commission has likewise made various attempts to visit the hunger
          strikers so as to gain more information as to their present condition.
          Unfortunately, the administration of Jneid military prison, which is
          not trained or qualified to run a prison which includes civilians, has
          refused to co-operate with the Commission and has not allowed its
          lawyers or field researchers to visit these detainees, or to have any
          contacts with them whatsoever. It should be noted that, in contract to
          all other prison administrations of the Palestinian Authority, Jneid
          prison has to the present date, never shown any willingness to
          co-operate with the Commission.</font

          National Security Forces in the West Bank, In which we demanded that
          the lawyers of our Commission be permitted to visit and talk to the
          prisoners. Despite our repeated daily contacts with his office, we
          were constantly given excuses and delays by way of answers to our

          in the strongest terms the continued detention of these citizens
          without cause, and considers this a clear violation of the most
          elementary of human rights, contradicting international conventions
          and agreements as well as domestic legal norms. We likewise strongly
          protest the refusal of the office of General <u>Hajj</u> Ismael to
          grant the Commission's lawyers permission to visit the prisoners, and
          declare this to be unprecedented. We fear that the reason for this
          refusal is the decision to conceal the violations of prisoners' rights
          being perpetrated within the prison.</font
