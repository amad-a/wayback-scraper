    The Sixth International Research and Advisory Panel (IRAP) Conference on
    Forced Migration completed its third day in Jerusalem.&nbsp; The conference
    in jointly presented by the International Association for the Study of
    Forced Migration (IASFM) and the Gaza Community Mental Health Program
    (GCMHP).&nbsp; The conference continues until 16 December.
    <p>
      This morning, participants heard plenary lectures by Mr. Eduard Nazarski,
      Political Director of the Dutch Refugee Council, Amsterdam, and by
      Professor Barry Stein of Michigan State University in the USA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nazarski spoke about host responses to asylum seekers in the European
      Union.&nbsp; He noted that European countries have passed restrictive
      asylum and immigration legislation since the 1980's, which involves
      carrier sanctions and detention of asylum seekers, among other
      measures.&nbsp; The discourse about refugees in Europe has shifted from
      protection and human rights to abuse, fraud, and punishment.&nbsp; He
      pointed out that the restrictive policies of European countries sets a
      "bad example" for refugee receiving countries in the developing world,
      which host the vast majority of the world's refugees.&nbsp; Mr. Nazarski
      emphasized the importance of promoting public sympathy for asylum seekers
      by showing that they are simply ordinary people in extraordinary
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Stein gave a talk on regional responses to refugee
      problems.&nbsp; He discussed the examples of the Economic Community of
      West African States (ECOWAS) intervention in Liberia and Sierra Leone, as
      well as the recent NATO/OSCE involvement in Kosovo.&nbsp; Regional
      responses, he said, have only become possible after attempts at
      international (UN) intervention have collapsed.&nbsp; Regional responses
      to refugee flows should be comprehensive in character, meaning that each
      state shares the burden to the best of its ability.&nbsp; Professor Stein
      warned, however, that military intervention may prolong suffering and
      war.&nbsp; He cited the case of Liberia where the ECOWAS intervention
      began just as warlord Charles Taylor, now President of Liberia, was on the
      brink of victory.&nbsp; The ECOWAS intervention prevented Taylor from
      completing his conquest of the country, and as a result factional fighting
      continued for five more years, resulting in several hundred thousand more
      deaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conference also featured a workshop on Palestinian Refugees and
      Cultural Identity.&nbsp; The workshop consisted of presentations by Dr.
      Najeh Jarrar on "Whither Palestinian Refugees? Palestinian refugees'
      uncertain future" and by Dr. Samir Qouta and Bradley Brigham of GCMHP
      (presented by Mr. Abdel Hamid Afana) on "The Long-term Perception of
      Forced Uprooting and the Persistence of Trauma through Generations: The
      Palestinian Experience".
    </p>
    <p>
      Other workshops were: <br />1- Insecurity: Hosts and Refugees in East
      Africa <br />2- Perspectives on Mental health Care of Refugees <br />3-
      Refugee Admission and Policy in Countries of the 'North' <br />4- Changes
      in Resettlement Policy <br />5- Forced Migration in South Asia and
      Southeast Asia
