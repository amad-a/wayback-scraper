      He rested his head in his hands and bowed for a long time.&nbsp; I waited
      for him to speak; and he finally whispered slowly, carefully selecting his
      words, “I spent my life traveling all over the world.&nbsp; I am a
      successful businessman and contractor.&nbsp; All my children are in
      universities or in business.&nbsp; But I don’t find any joy in life.&nbsp;
      I do not see any reason to continue.”&nbsp; Then he asked me, “Why am I
      engulfed in the idea of death?”&nbsp; He broke down, and tears rolled down
      his cheeks.&nbsp; He stopped them apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      His question occupied me.&nbsp; Philosophers are still differing on which
      is more natural, life or death.&nbsp; Some say that death is the only firm
      fact on this earth.&nbsp; Others say that life precedes death and is the
      root of existence.&nbsp; Some come back saying that life was created out
      of inanimateness.&nbsp; They also say that all creatures struggle their
      whole lives, and then go back to that state.&nbsp; Freud says that the
      instinct of life and death in people is a manifestation of a battle in
      which death inevitably wins regardless of the length of the battle.&nbsp;
      Nonetheless, the banner of life stays up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away from philosophy, a psychiatrist diagnoses depression when the patient
      is talking about death and the lack of will to continue to struggle.&nbsp;
      In the midst of life and trying to earn a living in a poor country,
      depression seems to be a minor concern.&nbsp; However, the feelings of
      sadness and pain are sometimes very strong.&nbsp; These feelings push the
      person towards suicide, with the life instinct, strong religious belief,
      and fear of punishment in the hereafter as factors finally preventing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people suffering from depression do not talk about death, but about
      memories.&nbsp; When a person enters the fifth or sixth decade of his life
      and especially in the midst of problems and pressure, he remembers his
      youth, tries to retrieve it, and tries to remodel his life for that
      purpose.&nbsp; “Mid-life crisis” is the term used by psychologists for
      this phenomenon.&nbsp; In this stage, the wife digs through her memories,
      and sometimes rebels against the unfairness suffered through the long
      years of marriage to a man that does not treat her well.&nbsp; She is in
      her forties, and all she wants is a word of love and praise.&nbsp; If she
      despairs, she asks for divorce.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the man who spent his life in business and moneymaking, he suddenly
      wakes up and sees the train of life passing him by.&nbsp; He tries to
      catch it before it reaches its final destination.&nbsp; He puts on a
      smile, bleaches his hair, and goes to great lengths to try to capture a
      new love before his days are over.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, these changes seem natural, and may raise
      self-confidence.&nbsp; Other times, they are a&nbsp; manifestation of
      depression, especially if accompanied by guilt and feelings that life has
      left him/her behind.&nbsp; Then memories center on a lost love or a lost
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have noticed that a sufferer’s description of depression is similar to a
      victim’s description of him/herself.&nbsp; Maybe this closeness between
      depression and victimization encouraged me to apply what I saw on the
      personal level to the national level, in order to try to understand the
      contemporary Palestinian political state in the context of the collective
      psyche of the Palestinian people.&nbsp; Since the catastrophe of 1948, the
      overwhelming feeling of the Palestinian people has been that they are
      victims.&nbsp; The catastrophe of 1948 was a stunning traumatic event that
      left behind many symptoms of depression.&nbsp; These symptoms were further
      worsened by the military Occupation that brought about feelings of
      helplessness.&nbsp; Eventually, anger rose and mixed with feelings of
      rebellion under national and religious banners.&nbsp; These led to the
      eruption of the Intifada.&nbsp; But the Intifada was followed by the
      disappointments of the failures of the peace process and poor Palestinian
      administration.&nbsp; Thus, the feelings of victimization prevailed over
      the feelings of victory that had spread for the first few years of the
      Intifada.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the wife who suffered injustice throughout life, Palestine should go
      over the memories of fifty years of catastrophe, revolution, Occupation,
      Intifada, and a ‘peace’ process.&nbsp; For Palestine, we should ask
      ourselves, “Where were we? Where are we now? Where are the martyrs? Where
      is the PLO? Where are the prisoners? Where is freedom? Where are the
      mistakes to learn from? Where are the sins that need forgiveness? Did we
      waste our lives chasing a far-fetched dream, like a woman who wasted her
      life trying to find the unknown lover?”&nbsp; As we cling to the beautiful
      memories of the lost homeland, we should loudly ask, “Are we today on the
      road to renaissance and building? Or are we still victims of ourselves,
      our slogans, and our ailments?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the simplicity of these questions, they are not easy to
      answer.&nbsp; The reassessment period should be clear so as not to lead to
      total depression.&nbsp; We should rise up and recover our self-confidence
      for a new beginning.
