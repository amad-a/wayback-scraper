      It might be acceptable to say that people have become accustomed to
      discontent and complaint throughout the centuries of foreign rule.&nbsp;
      It is safe to say that the Palestinian self-rule experience is in its
      infancy, sometimes moving forward and other times stumbling; but it,
      nonetheless, is a river running its course, as described by Mr. Hussien
      Hijazi’s article in Al-Ayyam on 27 September 1998.&nbsp; In his article,
      he says that corruption and corrupt people are like wood splinters the
      float on the surface of a big river.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can find the reasoning for people’s complaints in the fact that their
      interests are hindered by bureaucracy.&nbsp; It is now extremely difficult
      to obtain permission to open a commercial company; thus raising the
      question as to whether there is a policy to hinder economic growth rather
      than encourage it.&nbsp; Simultaneously, there are people who take pride
      in the achievements of the Palestinian Authority in building our society,
      establishing ministries and organizations, infrastructure projects,
      negotiations with Israel, and in the United Nations.&nbsp; One might even
      agree that the threat to declare a Palestinian State forced Israel to
      withdraw from some Palestinian land and stop settlement activity in other
      Palestinian areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there is no justification to the severe lack of pharmaceutical
      products from governmental healthcare centers, leading to doctors in the
      Ramallah hospital threat to halt all surgery due to the lack of silk and
      cat gut.&nbsp; It is also impossible to understand why the Ministry of
      Health does not have a reserve of children vaccinations for next
      year.&nbsp; Do bureaucracy and neglect justify depriving our children of
      their vaccinations?
    </p>
    <p>
      Minister of Health, Dr. Riyad El-Za’noun, undertook the responsibility of
      rebuilding the Ministry of Health.&nbsp; He invested a lot of time and
      effort in this task even before the establishment of the Palestinian
      Authority.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we find Palestinian health concerns still at
      a crucial crossroads.&nbsp; What is the reason?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Minister of Health says that he has no specific budget allocated to
      the it; and the Finance Ministry says that they don’t have any finances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where is the truth?&nbsp; Some say that the Finance Ministry spends large
      sums of money on lavish apartments and fancy cars for “influential people”
      in Gaza and Ramallah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it a matter of priorities?&nbsp; Is it bad planning and administration?
      Where is the role of the old and new Cabinets?&nbsp; Is it the
      responsibility of the Legislative Council? How long can we stay quiet on
      this danger threatening the lives of our children?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Palestinian Ministry of Health is full of problems.&nbsp; There are
      administrative problems and power center affecting appointments and
      operations.&nbsp; Knowing the health situation in Palestine, the Ministry
      of Health only spends $US 30 per capita annually, whereas the Israeli
      Ministry of Health spends $US 600.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before asking mercy from the world, we should be merciful towards
      ourselves.
