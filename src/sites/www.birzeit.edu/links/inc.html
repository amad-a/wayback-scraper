Unfortunately things have not got any better. Despite the claim that Bailasan aims to "increase the amount of Palestinian information on the internet" they have removed all of the sections that promised any information leaving a 3 page site. Perhaps most indicative of their attitude towards information is their <i>Palestine Directory</i>, which looks very, very familiar. I mean - link by link, section by section familiar.  However they lack graphics, reviews or design and are out of date by about 4 months - and I even send them the updates! <font size="2"><b>Added to Complete Guide: 6 February 1997.

<b>United Nations Development Programme (Programme of Assistance to the Palestinian People): <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815100412/http://www.papp.undp.org/">http://www.papp.undp.org</a></b> - UNDP (PAPP) became interested in the idea of building a Palestinian research and academic network around 1994, sponsoring and training universities in how to provide e-mail to their faculty. The website is a good current, reference point for those interested in this work and the wider work of the United Nations. Formerly attached to the Internet via the Hebrew University, UNDP now offers its service through a connection with IBM. UNDP supplied Birzeit University's webserver's connection, and contributed substantially to the development of the Birzeit's World Wide Web Project through equipment donations, just a few examples of the outstanding service it has provided to the Palestinian educational sector.  <font size="2"><b>Review last updated: 19 December 1997.</b> <a href="#top">Top of page.</a></font><br><br><br>
