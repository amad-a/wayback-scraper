<p>The weekly Palestinian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000623010557/http://www.jerusalem-times.com/">Jerusalem Times newspaper</a> has a website, although navigational and stylistic problems make finding what you need a little difficult.</p>

The PDIN website is maintained by the Interuniversity Consortium for Arab Studies (Montr�al), with the support of the Arts Computer Network, McGill University, and the World Bank.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000623010557/http://www.palecon.org/">Palestine Economic Forum</a> website offers publications including the excellent <i>Palestine Economic Pulse</i>, <i>West Bank and Gaza Update</i>, <i>Peace Economics</i>, articles and papers, and a discussion forum, which includes topics such as Public Sector Finances and Administration, International Trade, Investment, and Capital Flows, Private Sector Development, Human Resources, and Permanent Settlement Issues.</p>

<p>Palestine has a stock exchange! 1996 was the worst year ever for the Palestinian economy, but even in the worst of conditions, an efficient stock exchange should bring in higher investment. Indeed, the new Palestine Securities Exchange is doing its best to be efficient -- and has hopes for foreign investors from the Palestinian Diaspora, and even Israel.

<a name="borders"></a><h4><font color="DARKBLUE">Freedom of Movement and Borders</font></h4>
<p><font color="DARKBLUE">One of the major flaws of the Oslo accords (from a Palestinian perspective), closures and a lack of freedom of movement continue to sour feelings towards the peace process. <font color="BLACK"></p>
The <a href="/web/20000623010557/http://www.birzeit.edu/aff/index.html">Academic Freedom First</a> website, produced by the <a href="/web/20000623010557/http://www.birzeit.edu/hrap/index.html">Human Rights Action Project</a> at Birzeit University, offers an insight into the problems face by Gazan students who want to study in the West Bank. The control of movement, through checkpoints and a tightly-monitored permit system, is one of the biggest 'souring' influences for Joe Palestinian, who is being asked to support the peace process. Oslo has seen a worsening of this trend. </p>
<p>Some explanation of life under closure can be found in the <a href="/web/20000623010557/http://www.birzeit.edu/diary/closures/index.html">Closure Diary</a> section of <i>A Personal Diary of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</i>, mentioned in the <a href="#ground">A sense of what it's like "on the ground"</a> section above.

<p>Birzeit University's <a href="/web/20000623010557/http://www.birzeit.edu/hrap/index.html">Human Rights Action Project</a> is an excellent way of getting to grips with human rights as the community under scrutiny is that of a university with a population of only around 4,000 students.

<p><font color="DARKBLUE">Perhaps the most important aspect of the peace process is the measure of security it brings to people on the ground. In CNN-land, people become statistics and the news seems shallow when viewed from over here. Gerald Kessel certainly doesn't live in the West Bank. These sites offer a window into a more <i>real</i> life here.<font color="BLACK"></p>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000623010557/http://www.cprs-palestine.org/">Center for Palestinian Research and Studies</a> has a number of interesting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000623010557/http://www.cprs-palestine.org/polls/">opinion polls</a> which are well worth looking into fpor insight into how "the person on the street" sees things.

<p><a href="/web/20000623010557/http://www.birzeit.edu/palnews/war/index.html">On the ground in Ramallah: Reports from a town become battlefield</a> - a Birzeit University staff and student website constructed "live" during the September 1996 clashes that followed the opening of a tunnel in the Old City of Jerusalem. It offers information on a variety of levels - day-by-day area chronologies, official statements, eye-witness, vox-pop quotes from Birzeit staff and students, a photo diary and links to other information from Palestinian organisations. Excellent for getting a sense of how violent events unravel, how the Israeli army responds to Palestinian demonstrations, and what the politicians say afterwards. An extraordinarily popular website that resulted in $15,000 of equipment funding for Birzeit to expand its Web reporting. </p>
<p><a href="/web/20000623010557/http://www.birzeit.edu/diary/index.html">A Personal Diary of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</a> - A photodiary by Nigel Parry from Birzeit University's Public Relations Office, a resident of the West Bank town of Ramallah since 1994. The diary attempts to explain aspects of life here for Palestinians. The diary is searchable and is organised in chronological and subject indicies, with a focus on events affecting the university community of Birzeit. Here is what the Jewish Communications Network said about the diary: "A rare opportunity to see the post-Oslo period from a jarringly anti-Israeli perspective, and yet a perspective that is mature, sensitive and stylistically compelling. Watch out, you might become addicted to this site, returning frequently to seek out new diary entries. Peace engenders communication. We like the open tone of critical respect of this site -- reflecting one view -- yet presenting a break with the implacable style of past discourse. Polished and professional."</p>
