The Applied Research Institute - Jerusalem, actually located in Bethlehem, has information on environmental issues in Palestine, including some fine research papers and a collection of interesting maps. You can download environmental profiles of Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah, Jerusalem, Jericho, Hebron and Bethlehem. As a bonus, the website is laid out in an attractive and logical manner with regular updates. Also included are papers on the water conflict from a Palestinian perspective and a Palestinian vision of environmental protection and sustainable development. ARIJ's website really came into its own when the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815100313/http://www.arij.org/paleye/">Eye on Palestine</a> section was introduced in early 1997. See this section for excellent primers on understanding Israeli settlement policy, including the infamous Abu Ghnaim/Har Homa project and a host of others in the Jerusalem area.  Incredible maps, photos and arial photos facilitate understanding. Recent additions include an assessment of the Environmental Impact of Jewish Industries in the West Bank and material about the expropriation of Jalud lands. An <a href="./listserv.html">e-mailing list</a> is also available. ARIJ's website was featured twice in the <i>website of the month</i> section of the Complete Guide in 1997, for good reason.

IPS promotes research, analysis, and documentation on the Arab-Israeli conflict and its peaceful resolution.

Although the focus of each quarterly is on the Arab-Israeli conflict, the three journals offer different articles in keeping with the different interests of their subscribers. The website contains information about how to order the journals and other publications, all of which provide a rich resource for researchers interested in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
