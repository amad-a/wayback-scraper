In 1984 these faculties were unified under the umbrellas of Al-Quds University. The Al-Quds University site, which has grown very quickly recently, has all the usual things one would expect to find on a university webpage - information about academics, programs, departments, conferences, library, student life, and so on - in Arabic and English, presented clearly and attractively.<b>Review last updated: 16 September 1999.</b> <a href="#top">Top of page.</a></font><br><br><br>

You can find an overview, history, a list of colleges and pictures of the planned campus. The latter is obviously not built yet and looks a little like Disneyland. The AAUJ's "full affiliation with the California State University System" and current advert for a president with American educational management experience seems out of place and the university-under-construction was greeted with mixed feelings by Palestinian educationalists. There are already 6 universities for the Palestinian West Bank population of 1.5 million and many feel the existing universities should be built up, particulary the two in Gaza. Gaza has over 1,500 students who wish to study in West Bank insititutions who <a href="/web/20000623104340/http://www.birzeit.edu/aff/index.html">have been prevented from doing so by Israel for the two and a half years</a>.
