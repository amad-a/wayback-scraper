<li><b> 16 January 2000</b> - 
<p>Seventeen new websites added for this month. Most of the new sites are from the computer and information technology sites, and we now find 30 sites in this <a href="./inc.html">category</a>. Sites added include the software houses Noursoft  and Hadisoft. Emad computers and Nawras computers are also now online, as well as the website design company Intertech.
<p>New to the <a href="./ona.html">organizations and associations</a> section of the site are Al Ihsan Charitable society, Palestine Agricultural Relief Committees, Palestine Youth Union and the Qattan Foundation. The latter are currently advertising a grant program for the year 2000.
<p>One new site added in the <a href="./bnc.html">Business and Economy</a> section, that of the Management Consulting Services and 3 news sites in the Government and Services section - the Palestine Energy and Environment Research Centre , the Ramallah and Al Bireh Governates and the South African representative Office in Ramallah.
<p>In the <a href="./anc.html">Arts and Culture Section</a> we see 3 new sites, the only Gazan site for this month, that of the Gaza Village - a arts and crafts village located in Gaza city, the Palestinian magazine Al Karmel which provides Arabic language versions of its magazine on line as PDF files and finally this month's <a href="./wotm.html">website of the month</a> - Baha Bouraki's website. Baha is a Palestinian cartoonist whose drawings appear in Al Ayyam magazines and feature his characters Abu Arab and Abu Abed. Over 100 cartoons are available on his site.
<br><br>
<li><b> 24 September 1999</b> - 
Winners of the 1999 Golden Olive Awards have been announced. You can find those outstanding websites <a href="go99.html">here</a>. For a more detailed discussion of the web in Palestine during 1999, read the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000623042441/http://www.birzeit.edu/web/99internet.html">special report</a> by the Birzeit Webmaster. 
<br><br>
<li><b> 9 April 1999</b> - 
New websites this month are <a href="./ti.html#gst">Guiding Star Ltd</a>, a tourist company based in Jerusalem, <a href="./ona.html#usaid">USAID</a>, and <a href="./ona.html#prp">The Palestinian Rights Programme</a>. <a href="./pp.html#tahrir">Hizb-ut-Tahrir</a>, a political party, have also joined us on the web.
<p>The <a href="./anr.html#atf">Arab Thought Forum</a> now have their own domain name and updated their site, and the newspaper <a href="./nnm.html#assenara">Assenara</a> can now be found at http://www.assenara.com 
<p>The new NGO,<a href="./ona.html#key">Miftah</a>, have received this month's website of the month. They aim to build democracy in Palestine and also links with other countries. Headed by former Palestinian Minister of Higher Education, Hanan Ashrawi, they launched their website at the same time they formed. Good work.
<p>Also this month, we've launched a new section to the Complete Guide, our <a href="./store.html">Recommended Reading List</a>. Here you can read our reviews of recommended reading about Palestine, and then order the books on-line through Amazon.com.
<br><br>
<li><b> 3 March 1999</b> - 
New Palestinian websites this month include <a href="./ona.html#sabeel">Sabeel</a>, The <a href="./ti.html#commodore">Commodore Hotel</a>, and two personal  homepages of Palestinians living in Nablus, <a href="./ph.html#badran">Ismail Bardan</a> and <a href="./ph.html#omar">Omar Swaidan </a>. A German Academic Exhange  Program, <a href="./ona.html#daad">DAAD</a>,is also online.
<a href="./bnc.html#paltrade">Paltrade</a> - The Palestine Trade Center, have redesigned their  website.
An important international campaign seeking freedom for two Palestinians, <a href="./hr.html#fsaj">Samar and Jawad</a>, imprisoned in England now have a  website. 
We couldn't choose between two websites for websites of the month. <a href="./nnm.html#ali">Ali  Abunimah</a> - a Palestinian in Chicago - spends his spare-time  monitoring how the media reports on the Middle East. While on a local level, <a href="./bnc.html#supernet">Arab Supernet</a> have pioneered the use of a web-database interface in Palestine.
<br><br>
<li><b> 13 December 1998</b> - A few changes to existing sites this month. <a href="./ona.html#dheisheh">Dheisheh Refugee Camp</a> have changed their address,  The <a href="./nnm.html#jmcc">Jerusalem Media and Communication Centre</a> have made some big improvements to their site, <a href="./hr.html#addameer">Addameer</a> now have their own domain name and former Birzeit webmaster <a href="./nnm.html#diary">Nigel Parry</a> has one too  where you can find a mirror of his Personal Diary. 
<p>We've added an Israeli site called the <a href="./israel.html#research">Middle East Review of International Affairs</a> and the <a href="./anr.html#medea">European Institute for Research on Mediterranean and Euro-Arab Co-operation</a>. 
<p>There are a few local sites: an impressive publication <a href="./anr.html#jqf">The Jerusalem Quarterly File</a> is new to the web and the <a href="./ona.html#pngop">Welfare Association Consortium for the Palestinian NGO Project</a> have also joined us on-line. Also new this month is the <a href="./anc.html#house">House of Poetry</a>
<br><br>
<li><b> 3 November 1998</b> - Only a couple of weeks over the month deadline but we've been busy. Why? Have a look at <a href="./anr.html#ourvoice">Our Voice</a> and <a href="./nnm.html#outloud">OutLoud</a>.
<p>Website of the month is the site of two Palestinian artists, <a href="./anc.html#shammout">Shammout.com</a>. Definitely worth a visit.
<p>We've also added a new section to the Complete Guide, Political Parties. So far,<a href="./pp.html#fatah"> Fatah</a>,<a href="./pp.html#hamas"> Hamas</a> and the <a href="./pp.html#ppp">Palestine People's Party</a> are online.
<p>Hani Shakeel is in a <a href=".ph.html#hani"> Daze</a>, and you might want to look at the kind of advice our esteemed President is getting at the <a href="./anr.html#ppc">Palestine Planning Centre</a><br><br>
<li><b>16 September 1998</b> - We've had short break in updating the Guide but there are many new sites added. Website of the month is an on-line memorial to <a href="./om.html#yafa">Yafa</a>, home to thousands of Palestinians before Al-Nakba. We like this site because it shows how the web can be used to connect us with the past and the present. It has a wealth of information and a real feel of interaction. Good work and congratulations! 
<p>The choice was difficult though because many good sites have come online recently. You can find a lot of them in the Human Rights section of the guide, including; <a href="./hr.html#aff">The Academic Freedom First Campaign</a>, based at Birzeit University, have adopted a cool style but serious message. 
<a href="./hr.html#badil">BADIL</a> - A Bethlehem based NGO with a wealth of great information and an oral history archive. 
<a href="./hr.html#addameer">Addameer</a> is also new to the web with information about Palestinian prisoners.<a href="./hr.html#assoc40">Association of 40</a> - a tri-lingual site about unrecognized villages. 
<p>Also new to the Web, <a href="./nnm.html#freedom">Freedom - the mailing list - now have a website.</a> We've found three Arabic newspapers - <a href="./nnm.html#kul">Kul Al Arab</a>,<a href="./nnm.html#assenara"> Assenara</a> and <a href="./nnm.html#alsabar">Al Sabar</a> and a couple of hotels, <a href="./ti.html#city">The City Inn Hotel</a> and <a href="./ti.html#alcazar">Alcazar Hotel.</a> If you are into business in Palestine, invest some time at the <a href="./bnc.html#ptpo">Palestinian Trade Promotion Organization</a>, the <a href="./bnc.html#apic">Arab Palestinian Investment Company</a> and <a href="./bnc.html#supernet">Arab Supernet</a>. To see a good idea gone wrong, visit <a href="./anc.html#sport">Sport-On-Line</a>. A nice site for a great theatre company can be found at the <a href="./anc.html#ashtar">Ashtar Theatre</a> website and two very different kinds of study can be pursued at <a href="./snu.html#ppi">The Palestine Polytechnic Insitute</a> or the <a href="./snu.html#bbc">Bethlehem Bible College.</a> Finally, the <a href="./hr.html#aic">Alternative Information Centre</a> have changed their site and an Islamic organization which gives scholarships to students can be found at the <a href="./ona.html#aasa">Association for Arab Students Affairs.</a>
<br><br>
<li><b>13 May 1998</b> - Slow with updates this month, they will all be done today. First and foremost, congratulations to the webmaster and authors of the Dheisheh Refugee Camp homepage, the first Palestinian refugee camp online! You can find <a href="./ona.html#dheisheh">the review here in organisations and associations</a>, and note that they have also won May's <a href="./wotm.html">website of the month</a> award! <i>Alf mabrook!</i>. <a href="./snu.html#alhash">Al-Hashamiyyeh Secondary School in Al-Bireh</a> is online but the website is not worth visiting. The <a href="./ti.html#capitolina">Capitolina</a> and <a href="./ti.html#ach">American Colony</a> hotels in Jerusalem were added to tourist information. Unfortunately, just found out about the <a href="./bnc.html#apr98conf">The First International Economic Conference in Palestine From 27 to 29 April 1998</a>. More sites and next edition of "Birzeit, Palestine and the World Wide Web" in the next week. <a href="./mailist.html">Sign up now</a> if you don't receive it. As Israel is celebrating it's fiftieth anniversary and Palestinians are commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Nakba (Catastrophe), why not spend some time reflecting on this duality in our <a href="./om.html">online memorials</a> section?<br><br>
<li><b>23 April 1998</b> - The April edition of "Birzeit, Palestine and the World Wide Web" is now online in the <a href="archive/index.html">archive</a> section.

Ahmad has been in prison without charge or trial for five years. An attractive website design, content and timeliness made this March's <a href="./wotm.html">website of the month</a>.<br><br>
<li><b>5 March 1998</b> - An under construction <a href="./gns.html#nm">Nablus Municipality</a> page (in 'government and services') and a single page for the <a href="./ona.html#lwnp">Library on Wheels for Nonviolence and Peace</a> (in 'organisations and associations'). An outside addition in 'personal homepages' is <a href="./ph.html#mazen">Mazen Abu Hijleh's homepage</a>. It's got a great collection of links. Please also visit Lycos and Excite's city net pages from the explanatory text on the Complete Guide homepage. These are two search engines that recognise that the West Bank and Gaza are disputed territories that are not automatically part of Israel. ABC News has also presented this in a thoughtful way. <br><br>
