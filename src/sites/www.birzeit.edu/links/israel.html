 - <i>Ha'aretz </i>may not have the widest circulation among Hebrew dailies, but it has always been considered the leading intellectual Hebrew daily. It's pages are rich with columns and articles written by Israel's foremost academics and politicians, but if you don't read Hebrew, you're out of luck. That is, until now. <i>Ha'aretz's</i> new website features English translations of top news stories and a handful of editorials and op-ed pieces. The unbiased news coverage is also a relief after reading the less-than-balanced pages of the<i> Jerusalem Post</i> (see below). Of course, a photo or two would be a nice addition to the text, but let's not be picky.

The site is rated the 6th most visited site world-wide and its number of hits per annum reaches the tens of millions. As a regular reader of the <i>Post's</i> print edition, I find this a bit disheartening. The paper could only be considered even-handed by members of the Likud Party (e.g. the weather map's political boundaries don't recognize a difference between the West Bank, Gaza or the Golan. Only the Golan and East Jerusalem have been annexed as part of Metropolitan Israel). As for polished, well... I always get a kick out of finding the rare typo or grammar error in the <i>New York Times</i>. With the <i>Post</i>, the complete lack of properly edited text gets rather tiring.
