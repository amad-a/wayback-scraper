This site has undergone a total revamp and is now one of the best sites in Palestine. Utilizing a database interface which is a first for Palestine, users can navigate their way through information about companies, businesses and organizations. The site allows organizations to add information about themselves which can then be updated on-line at any time. The format of this site has enormous potential to be expanded into other areas of Palestinian society. This really is the next step in Palestinian websites.

It was assigned by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the newly-formed Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to prepare and monitor development projects financed by foreign aid and to coordinate the activities of the donor countries in the Palestinian Territories. Acting on the economic guidelines of the PNA, PECDAR has evolved to become the development think-tank of Palestine and the implementing agency assigned by the PNA, the World Bank and the donor states to propose, select and implement foreign aid-funded projects as well as to coordinate and facilitate the flow and allocation of the funds. Lately, it's responsibilities have grown larger, to include promoting investment opportunities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, contributing to and chairing some sector working Groups (SWG) which are sub-committees of the LACC (Local Aid Coordination Committee) a committee composed of the Palestinian Authority and all donor countries with representation in the area.  The site contains links to PECDAR's 1998, 1997, and 1996 activity reports, its "monthly" news issues (last issue listed is for March 1999), lists of publications available to buy from PECDAR, and quarterly reports on the Palestinian economy. <b>Added to Complete Guide: 21 December 1997.
