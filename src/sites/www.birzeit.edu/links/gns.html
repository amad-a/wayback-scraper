If that wasn't enough, there is also the Census Progress in Pictures, Census Publications and...Other Activities.

The latter is perhaps a little misleading. Although Ramallah once enjoyed the reputation as the second most popular summer resort in the Arab World during the early 1960s, the Israeli occupation terminated this role completely through travel restrictions and de-development. <b>Added to Complete Guide: 16 February 1998.</b> <a href="#top">Top of page.</a></font><br><br><br>

We were founded in 1979 by a group of Palestinian doctors and health professionals seeking to supplement the decayed and inadequate health infrastructure caused by years of Israeli military occupation."  The siteoffers information about UPMRC - its missions and background, and a variety of published material in its "Health in Palestine" section.

Unfortunately, the English version is under construction, and the Arabic version turns into gibberish on my screen, no matter what I try.  It recommends Internet Explorer 4.x or above, which I don't happen to have, so you're on your own for this one.
