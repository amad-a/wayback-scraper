            /><br /><font size="1" color="DARKBLUE"><b>Right: Bassil</b></font>
            <p>
              Bassil was born in 1969 and grew up in the village of Beit Hanoun
              in a large family of ten brothers and four sisters. His family and
              friends remember him as a kind, easy-going and intelligent man.
            </p>
            <p>
              He went to school in the village and was always one of the best
              students. During the Intifada the Israeli occupation forces closed
              the school and forced all the students to go and study in the
              Al-Falujah school in Jabalya refugee camp. Because of the distance
              from the village, most of the students from Beit Hanoun eventually
              dropped out of their classes. However Bassil was determined to
              finish and he did so very successfully.
            </p>
            <p>
              After completing school he went to study nursing in the Al
              Houkama' College in Gaza. When he graduated he went to work at Al
              Shifa' Hospital in Gaza. Hospital staff remember his ability to
              bring the hospital personnel together. This hospital staff
              remember that their community was filled with more love and
              closeness than any family. Patients whom he cared for in the
              hospital kept in contact with him even after they left, often
              visiting his house.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bassil married a girl from the same village and had two children,
              a boy, Mohammed, and a girl, <i>Malaak</i> ("Angel"). His third
              child, Bassil, born 5 months after his death, will never see his
              father.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bassil was always disturbed by suffering. Whether it was a child
              in pain, an injured youth, or a sick elderly person, he always was
              the first to help. Whenever there were clashes he volunteered to
              work in the ambulance, helping those injured. During the Intifada
              he used to treat the injured outside the hospital because of the
              danger of Israeli soldiers arresting people at the hospital. This
              put Bassil himself in danger and he lived with this constant
              threat.

            >
            <p>
              Although he was very busy with his work and his own family, he
              kept in contact with his brothers, sisters and parents. Whenever
              he found time he would visit them and suggest they go on a picnic
              to the beach - the only available place for Gazans to go and
              relax.
            </p>
            <p>
              His elder brother by 4 years, Kamal, remembers once going home
              angry with Bassil after an argument. Bassil couldn't sleep that
              night and he appeared at his brother's place after midnight
              apologizing and crying, leaving nothing for Kamal to do except hug
              him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bassil was very proud of his car and never stopped saying how it
              could handle any problems on the road. Two of his brothers, Iyad
              and 'Imad, recall being in the car with Bassil one time. On the
              way back home the car fell into a very small pothole and the two
              right wheels were punctured with a very loud noise. They got out
              of the car, laughing at Bassil, telling him how his wonderful car
              couldn't handle the smallest hole!
            </p>
            <p>
              On the Thursday 26 September 1996, Bassil was working in an
              ambulance during the clashes. As usual he was one of the first at
              the site to give medical aid. He arrived at Erez border area and
              gave assistance to a Palestinian worker who had been shot in the
              head. He took him to the hospital and returned to Erez. Next, he
              helped a child, Tamir Al Masri, who was in a serious condition and
              died in hospital three days later.
            </p>
            <p>
              Israeli soldiers were shooting at the ambulances and one driver
              was injured. Bassil saw an injured boy lying on the ground whom
              other medical personnel could not reach due to the heavy firing.
              With no thought for his own safety, Bassil jumped from the
              ambulance and ran over to the boy to help. There, he found him
              already dead. As he lifted him to take him to the ambulance,
              Bassil's white coat soaking up the boy's blood, a bullet from an
              Israeli sniper standing 15 metres away hit him in the heart and
              exited through his back. Bassil died instantly, having spent his
              life for others.
