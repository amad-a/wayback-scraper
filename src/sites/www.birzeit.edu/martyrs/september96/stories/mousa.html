            /><br /><font size="1" color="DARKBLUE"><b>Right: Mousa</b></font>
            <p>
              Mousa was born to a simple Bedouin family. He had two brothers,
              one younger, one older. His mother died when he was fifteen. His
              father married again and had two children. The family was forced
              to leave Beer A-Sabe' where they originated from during the war of
              1948, and became refugees in Gaza.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mousa's elementary studies were in Deir Al-Balah and he later
              dropped out of school because he didn't enjoy it. He became a
              shepherd, occasionally working in the agriculture industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mousa had lots of friends in the neighborhood. His friends
              remember his complete calmness and silence most of the time. He
              was respected by all around him for his courage and honesty, and
              his willingness to always help his friends. His friends remember
              how they used to tease him by hiding the little food he took with
              him while shepherding.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Mousa turned 20, he began to think about getting married to a
              relative whom he loved very much. But his family was very poor and
              he had to add a room to their house and furnish it in order to get
              married. He also needed enough money to pay the dowry for his
              bride, as is the custom in Bedouin tribes. So Mousa began to think
              of changing his work in order to earn more money. His father was
              also hoping that Mousa would marry because he had lost his eldest
              son, Shafiq, a year earlier through illness and Mousa's youngest
              brother was still in school.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mousa thought of working within the borders of Israel, but this
              was very difficult because the Israeli authorities wouldn't give
              him a permit. Mousa and some of his friends were thinking of
              breaking through the barbed wire around Gaza in order to enter
              Israel to find work. Although it was very dangerous, they had no
              choice because of the difficult situation in Gaza.
            </p>
            <p>
              One day, they made it through the barbed wire and were able to
              enter Israel. An Israeli patrol noticed them and started to chase
              them. They all ran in different directions, but the soldiers
              grabbed one of the friends, who was then arrested and detained for
              four months. Mousa was to die while he was still in prison.
            </p>
            <p>
              On Thursday 26 September 1996, the day the bloody clashes began in
              Gaza, Mousa was harvesting on the farm where he was working, when
              he heard the sound of gunfire and saw tens of protestors falling
              one by one, either injured or killed. Mousa couldn't stand aside
              and watch his own people being murdered, so he joined the
              protestors. Shortly afterwards, when they were near the Israeli
              settlement of Kfar Darom, he was shot in the chest with live
              ammunition. He died instantly.
            </p>
            <p>
              The medics on the scene were unable to help him in any way. In the
              late afternoon of the same day, he was buried in his village. His
              father couldn't say a word or make any movement throughout the
              funeral. The shock was more than he could bear.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mousa never felt comfortable in enclosed spaces and loved to go
              out alone every day with his sheep and enjoy the nature that
              surrounded him. He used to wake up before sunrise, prepare
              something simple to eat such as a piece of bread and a couple of
              tomatoes, and then go to the barn to check each sheep and goat one
              by one to make sure that they were in good health. He knew each
              one of his herd and tended the sick ones until they became well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mousa liked to go for long walks to the eastern edges of the area
              and to look towards the far reaches of the land, to look to his
              old home, Beer El-Sabe'. The land about which his father told him
              that they used to live in and harvest before they became refugees.
            </p>
            <p>
              He was saddened when he thought of Palestinians not able to have
              freedom of movement like the sheep. Instead he saw only barbed
              wire separating the surrounding settlements. He saw the land with
              his eyes and his mind, but he could never physically reach it. He
              used to hear about peace between Israelis and Palestinians, but he
              could never believed in it. "What kind of peace is this?" he used
              to say, "if our land is still confiscated and we cannot return to
              our homes?"
