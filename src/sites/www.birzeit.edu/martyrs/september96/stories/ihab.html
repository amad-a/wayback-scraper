              ><b>Right: Ihab, in a Gaza photo studio.</b></font
            >
            <p>
              Ihab was born in Libya, where he lived with his parents, his only
              brother, and four sisters. Temporary citizens of the Palestinian
              Diaspora, Ihab and his family had always dreamt of the day when
              they could return to their homeland - Palestine. After the Oslo
              Agreements, in 1995, the family managed to return.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ihab's eyes had sparkled at the thought. He was ecstatic to
              finally step foot on his land. His dream had become reality. Ihab
              had other dreams.
            </p>
            <p>
              He joined one of Gaza's high schools to finish his studies.
              Unusually for a teenager, Ihab loved to study and go to school.
              Those who knew him remembered how books were his closest friends.
              He devoured knowledge, always reading newspapers, magazines and
              books.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though he was only in Gaza for a year after his return from
              Libya, his friends say it would be difficult to forget Ihab.
              Although he was calm and quiet, his conversations were filled with
              life. People loved talking with him.
            </p>
            <p>
              When he came back from school each day he used to do his homework
              and study. After that he would leave the house to meet with
              friends and to talk about school life and their futures. When Ihab
              was in Libya he used to go to a club and practice soccer under the
              guidance of a coach. But in Gaza, where there were no soccer
              grounds, he was satisfied with empty fields.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summer, during school vacation, Ihab got the chance to practice
              his other favourite hobbies - fishing and swimming. His fishing
              rod and net still hang on the wall in the living room of his
              house.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ihab's family cannot stop thinking about him. His little sister,
              11, remembers how he used to help her with homework and how he
              loved playing with her. In the evenings Ihab always had stories to
              tell. She remembers him singing <i>Ahwak</i> (" I adore you with
              all my heart") by Abdul Halim Hafez which was his favourite song.
            </p>
            <p>
              On Thursday 26 September 1996, Ihab went to school as usual but
              the day was not a usual day. Clashes were carrying on between
              Palestinians and Israeli soldiers and Ihab and his friends were
              standing near the school and listening to the sounds of shooting
              which filled the air. Three shots rang out and he fell to the
              ground. One bullet went through his spine, the second destroyed
              one of his kidneys and the third lodged in his stomach.
            </p>
            <p>
              Passers-by rushed him to the hospital. When his family heard he
              was injured they hurried there to find Ihab struggling between
              life and death. The few moments he could talk, he tried to calm
              his family and make it easier for them. The horrible pain
              prevented him from saying much more than a few words.
            </p>
            <p>
              The days after his injuries passed slowly and painfully. The
              family home, which had been so full of life and warmth, fell
              silent. Everyone thought of Ihab and his condition which was
              worsening because of a lack of medical equipment in the Gaza
              hospital. The closure of the Gaza Strip and separation from the
              West Bank did not make it possible to transfer him to another
              hospital to get the needed treatment. He remained in Gaza Hospital
              for more than a month.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result of the intercession of Arab members of the Israeli
              Knesset, Ihab was transfered to the Israeli Tul Hashomer hospital,
              although none of his family were allowed to accompany him. He died
              a few days later on the 18th of November 1996, aged 16, without a
              chance to say a final goodbye to his family and friends. His
              mother still talks of how she had hoped he would recover and come
              back to the house.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ihab's great passion had always been science at school and he had
              hoped to become a surgeon. This was a result of his experience as
              a small child, when he developed appendicitis and was hospitalised
              for a month. Immediately afterwards, he also began to suffer from
              arthritis and never really recovered, always experiencing a little
              pain, especially during the winter. These problems made Ihab
              interested in learning about medicine. Aware of his own pain, he
              hoped that he could one day help to relieve the pain of others.
              Unfortunately, for him and them, this was one dream that would
              remain unfulfilled.
