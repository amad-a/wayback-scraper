            <p>
              Tammam didn't like school and left in ninth grade to work as a
              hairdresser, a skill he had learnt from his father. However he had
              another hobby, video photography, which later evolved into a part
              time job as a cameraman with Nasr TV in Ramallah. On the first day
              of the clashes, he photographed 5 deaths including one man who was
              his close friend.
            </p>
            <p>
              He liked to have fun and was always playing practical jokes on his
              friends. One friend recalls him putting salt instead of sugar into
              his tea. One day he was visiting his father-in-law in Jordan. He
              was making tea while his father-in-law was watching. Then he
              emptied the tea pot and filled it up with cold water. He held the
              pot and poured it on his father-in-law's head who started to
              scream not realising the water was cold.

              He had a cousin Nura who used to live in Jordan. One day she
              visited Palestine where she met Tammam who later became her
              husband. She says, "We loved and respected each other. We lived
              together 14 years and 26 days. I can still hear his voice calling
              me "Sweetheart" or "Honey." He used to talk like that on the phone
              from his workshop. Customers could hardly believe he was talking
              to his wife!

              "He liked to watch TV, most of all Tom and Jerry cartoons. He
              would watch Tom and Jerry every morning even if it meant he was
              late to work. He used to start his day by putting on his radio to
              a Fairuz song and then wake me. We would drink coffee together,
              watching Tom and Jerry and then he would drive his car to work.
              Sometimes I would start the car myself asking him the daily
              question: What do you want me to make for lunch? And everyday he
              would answer, "Anything!"

              "He liked cars, especially red ones. He dreamt of racing cars. The
              children around here loved him very much, and called him 'Uncle'.
              Even today when I drive his car the children in the neigbourhood
              will shout at me, 'That is Uncle Tammam's car! Not yours!'"

              "We were so close. During the Intifada he worked for the
              Cairo-Amman Bank, travelling to Israel and other parts of the West
              Bank as a fieldworker. He was supposed to finish his work and go
              back as soon as possible but he always took me with him and we
              would walk around together instead of going back to work.

              "We would do silly things - like walking together, eating ice
              cream on the beach in winter. He would take me to picnics where he
              enjoyed smoking <i>Nargileh</i> (the Arabic "water pipe").
            </p>
            <p>
              "He loved music. When he was young he learnt to play the electric
              organ. His favourite singer was <i>Abdul Halim Hafez</i> one of
              the great Arab singers. I remember him telling me that in his last
              year at school he wrote one of Abdul Halim's songs on an exam
              instead of answering the questions. He also liked Um Kulthum. Two
              of his brothers were good singers, performing at weddings and
              parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              "On Thursday 26 September 1996, the second day of the clashes, I
              insisted on going out with him because the day before I was very
              scared after hearing him reporting the events on TV. As usual we
              drank coffee, watched Tom and Jerry, and went out together down to
              the checkpoint to cover the clashes. I even took onion with me
              afraid of being affected by tear gas (onion is one popular
              Palestinian antidote to tear gas)."
            </p>
            <p>
              "When the helicopter started to shoot he convinced me to stay at a
              friend's apartment nearby. I waited for him there but started to
              worry and phoned him on his mobile. A stranger's voice answered me
              telling me that the owner of this mobile was lying in the
              hospital. I arrived at the hospital to discover that he was dead.
              I uncovered him. Looked at him. Touched him. He was warm and I
              kissed him. He was my angel."
