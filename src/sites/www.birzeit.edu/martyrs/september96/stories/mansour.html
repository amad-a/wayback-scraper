                Mansour's great love in life was cars. Not able to afford his
                own, he was a regular customer at Orabi rent-a-car in Al-Bireh,
                on the outskirts of Ramallah. Once a week he would hire a car
                and drive friends for a picnic to the Dead Sea, Jericho or
                Hebron. He liked parties of all kinds, particularly those with
                traditional Palestinian music and <i>Dabke</i> (Palestinian
                dance).

                Mansour loved children and was very close to his little sister,
                Narmine. Although only four years old when he died, she still
                has vivid memories of him taking her for drives to buy biscuits
                and sweets. When he traveled to Jordan he would bring her back
                presents, often a dress or bracelets. When asked about his
                death, Narmine said, "The Israelis killed him but he went to
                heaven." Every day she recites prayers for him, believing it
                will make his life in heaven better.

                Mansour was a hard worker. He had worked in the vegetable market
                in Ramallah for the last three weeks before his death. For three
                years before this, he had driven a truck between Jenin and
                Ramallah, bringing vegetables and fruits to the market. He would
                often bring things home for the family that he had bought with
                his wages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before his job as a truck driver, Mansour worked for a Jewish
                family inside Israel with his older brother. He formed a close
                relationship with them and when this family found out he had
                left his truck driving job the family had tried to convince him
                to come back and work for them. After hearing about his death,
                the Jewish family were grief-stricken. They immediately tried to
                visit his family in Ramallah but were unable to do so because of
                the closure of the West Bank in place at the time of the
                September clashes. When the closure was lifted they visited
                Mansour's brother in Kalandiya Refugee Camp, and called his
                parents. Mansour's father still recalls their tears at his son's
                death.

                Mansour came from a large family of 11 children. His mother,
                Zahra, recalls having a very close relationship with him and he
                fondly called her by the nickname <i>Ya Zaheera</i> ("the little
                rose"). Two of his younger brothers were disabled, one of them
                with half his body paralyzed and the other almost blind.
                Mansour's father is 70 and still works to support the family.
                While alive, Mansour was the family's main source of income
                because his two older brothers are married and are only able to
                support their own wives and children.

                Mansour was himself looking forward to getting married. At one
                point he had wanted to marry a Palestinian girl from within the
                1948 borders of Israel but his parents had not approved. "As you
                like," Mansour said to his mother, "I give up! You find me a
                wife!" According to the traditional Arab custom, his mother
                began looking for a wife for him.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mansour had grand plans for his wedding. He desperately wanted
                the event to be held in the streets outside his house in the
                center of Ramallah. He had already started to buy and store gold
                and presents for his future wife. Towards the end of his life he
                had said to his parents, "Unless I'm married soon, I'm going to
                leave for a long time. I want to go to the USA to work and
                live."
              </p>
              <p>
                Mansour had a generous nature and was always willing to help
                people. His mother tells of an incident in a house across the
                road. Three families lived in this house - two men with their
                families, and a women with her son. The two men were trying to
                evict the women without paying her money owed to her. They
                bullied and screamed at her. Hearing one of these screaming
                incidents, Mansour had visited the house and told the men to
                leave the women alone. They tried to bribe him to forget the
                matter but he refused. Due to his intervention, the women was
                eventually paid the money owed to her and is now living
                peacefully in a new house. She regularly visited Mansour and his
                family to thank him for what he did, and was heartbroken by his
                death.
              </p>
              <p>
                In another incident Mansour had been playing with his brothers
                and sisters on the roof of the house during a rare snowstorm. He
                heard a fight occurring in the street below and jumped down from
                the roof to break up the fight. He never called himself
                religious and had never learnt to pray. His kindheartedness
                stemmed from his love of people.

                Mansour was almost two metres tall and his height was the butt
                of many jokes. At one point during the 1991 Gulf War, despite a
                curfew banning Palestinians from leaving their houses, Mansour
                had gone out onto the streets with a friend. He was arrested by
                an Israeli undercover unit and imprisoned. While in prison he
                was always the one asked to change lightbulbs by the Israeli
                guards, because of his height.
              </p>
              <p>
                His younger brother was normal height but Mansour dwarfed him.
                For this reason Mansour used to call him
                <i>Nusf Nasayf</i> ("half the half") after a character in an
                Arabic folk tale who was a very short thief. He enjoyed teasing
                his brothers and sisters in fun. Sometimes he would unplug the
                TV while they were watching, then plug in his stereo and force
                them to dance with him.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the age of 22, Mansour was martyred. He died in Ramallah
                Hospital at 3:00 am on Saturday 28 September 1996. On Thursday
                26 September, Along with thousands of others outraged by
                continued Israeli actions that humiliate the Palestinian people,
                Mansour had gone to demonstrate at Ma'alufiyya checkpoint near
                Ramallah, where he was shot in the chest with live ammunition.
                Mansour was not involved in a political party when he was shot.
                "Bullets don't differentiate," his father said, "There is
                nothing written on a man's head. For the Israelis, a Palestinian
                is just a Palestinian. They don't think about someone's politics
                when they shoot."

                Mansour's father, reminiscing about his son's desire for a
                wedding party in the streets of Ramallah, said, "It was only at
                his funeral that we witnessed such a gathering." For days, those
                passing through Ramallah's Clock Manara where the family home is
                located, saw a large number of people sitting in chairs on the
                streets outside, all gathering to express their condolences to
                Mansour's family.

                    have a photo made, if none exists.</b
