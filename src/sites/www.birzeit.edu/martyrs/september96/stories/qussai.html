              Qussai Mohammed Abd Al Karim �Ukasha, aged 20, Rafah, Gaza Strip.

            <!-- The story, each paragraph surrounded by start and end paragraph tags please -->
            <p>
              Qussai returned with his family to their homeland after the Oslo
              Accords, in 1994. Qussai�s family lived in Yemen where his father
              had been working and Qussai had grown up and finished school in
              Aden . After graduation he went to Britain for 1 year where he
              studied English language.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1993, Qussai joined the Palestinian Liberation Organisation and
              completed several military training courses in Syria and Yemen.
              His friends remember him for being an excellent marksman. Although
              he loved to socialise, he didn�t have many friends out of the
              military base because he had only returned recently from Yemen.
            </p>
            <p>
              When they arrived in Gaza, the family moved to the southern town
              of Rafah, which was under the control of the Palestinian
              Authority. Qussai loved his relatives dearly and did not allow the
              division of Gaza to prevent him from visiting them in Jabalya
              camp, which was still under Israeli control at the time. One day
              he went to Jabalya, wearing his uniform and carrying his gun. When
              he saw his relatives for the first time, he was so happy that he
              started shooting in the ai, despite the presence of Israeli troops
              on the borders of the camp.
            </p>
            <p>
              Qussai was working on a checkpoint near Kfar Darom settlement on
              Thursday 26 September 1996. A large crowd of school students and
              many other people were protesting and Qussai was trying with his
              colleagues to control the crowd. The Israelis didn�t give them a
              chance to clear the area before opening fire.
            </p>
            <p>
              People began to fall, either dead or injured. Qussai started
              quickly to help people into ambulances but even this he was not
              able to do as the Israeli soldiers were shooting at medical
              personnel. Feeling he had no option, Qussai took his gun and went
              to defend the unarmed Palestinians that were being killed, but was
              shot in the chest and died instantly. The checkpoint now holds his
              name and a memorial statue of him.
