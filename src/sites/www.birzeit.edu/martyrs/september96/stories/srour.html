              ><b>Right: Mohammed, his sister, neice and mother.</b></font
            >
            <p>
              Mohammed was an honor list business student at Bethlehem
              University. "He was calm, kind and caring," his sister said. "He
              never wanted to see anyone unhappy." He was known to have a rare
              balance in his life, between his study, social activities, and
              family duties.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mohammed's father died when he was just a kid. His elder brother
              was killed mysteriously two years ago. At that time another of his
              elder brothers was arrested by the Israelis and remained in jail.
              Mohammed was forced to quit studying for a year to help his family
              with money. Despite this, or perhaps because of this, Mohammed was
              a strong believer in God and regularly prayed.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Mohammed was young, his family lived in 'Aida refugee camp,
              where he was popular with the camp's old women for his willingness
              to help them carry wood, and with the cooking and cleaning.

              "He loved to cook," his sister-in-law said. "He used to come into
              the kitchen, kick us all out and make delicious dinners. The
              problem was he made a big mess and did not clean it up."
            </p>
            <p>
              Mohammed's other hobby was carving olive wood and making
              decorations for the house.
            </p>
            <p>
              He began his studies at Birzeit University and was active in the
              Environmental Committee of the Student Council. When he transfered
              to Bethlehem, after he worked for the year to help his family, he
              founded a similar comittee there. The day he died was supposed to
              be the day he would officially announce the foundation of this
              committee and its first event.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mohammed was very helpful and responsible. Once, his mother and
              sister were in Jordan and when they came back they found him
              baking bread for his brothers. They offered to help but would not
              accept their help, saying that they were tired and should rest.
            </p>
            <p>
              He loved to work in the land, pick olives, and plant fruits
              including a strawberry patch which he tended in the back yard of
              the house.

              His friends still visit his mother and eat meals with the family.
              He was his mother's favourite and now she considers all his
              friends to be "her sons."

              Mohammed's favourite member of his extended family was a niece
              with whom he loved to play.
            </p>
            <p>
              On 26 September 1996, Mohammed's life was ended by an Israeli
              bullet in his head. He was 26 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mohammed had donated blood in the week before his death. "These
              days," he had said at the time, "we have nothing to give except
              our blood".
