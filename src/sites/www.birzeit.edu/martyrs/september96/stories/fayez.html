            <p>
              Fayez took good care of his parents and his mother jokes that even
              his birth was easy. They remember him as a revolutionary, an
              activist, honest and full of committment to his people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fayez was deeply religious. He spent most of his time at the
              mosque after work, praying and reading the Quran. His friends used
              to laugh at his committment to prayer, saying, "You pray so avidly
              it is like someone is paying you a salary." After praying he would
              exercise, water his garden, then go to his job. He would never
              stay longer than 4 pm, take lunch, than go and pray. He also used
              to maintain the garden at the mosque. He loved nature and planted
              roses and vines around his house.
            </p>
            <p>
              He liked to listen to Islamic songs and he kept up hs religious
              duties at the mosque near his house. One of his friends from the
              mosque said, "Fayez was a kind-hearted guy. Hatred is something he
              never knew. He never frowned. Two days before he died he asked me
              to take responsibility for his wedding arrangements. Instead of a
              wedding party we had a martyrdom party, and the same band that was
              supposed to sing at his wedding sang at his funeral." His friends
              used to call him <i>Abu Islam</i> ("Father of Islam"). He was
              self-confident and never paid attention to gossip.
            </p>
            <p>
              He used to visit his married sisters each morning and have
              breakfast with one of them. His favourite cuisine was
              <i>maqlubi</i> (lit. "upside down", a Palestinian chicken and rice
              dish, so-called because it is cooked and then turned over onto the
              serving dish) and he used to only drink water. He loved
              vegetables, especially lettuce and cucumber.

              He liked to play with his nephews and nieces especially Mashroun,
              the son of his brother. Mashroun remembers that whenever his
              grandfather got angry with him, Fayez would defend him.

              Fayez did not like school and left it at an early age. He liked
              work more than education. He worked as a central heating
              technician and as a construction worker. Before he died he used to
              work on building his own house which was completed until a few
              days before his death. His family found the keys to his house a
              few metres from where he was buried, after they apparently fell
              from his pocket.
            </p>
            <p>
              His fiancee was chosen for him by his sister as he was very shy
              around women. She said that at the time of the clashes she had
              marched at the front - he saw her and gave her a disapproving look
              so she moved to the back. That was her last memory of him.
            </p>
            <p>
              He never really worried about his future except in relation to
              soccer. This optimistic attitude to life was reflected in his two
              favorite phases, "Forget it" and "Consider it done". He also liked
              the religious saying, " A smile in your brother's face is a
              virtue." He loved soccer and played in the Ramallah Islamic team.
              He also coached children at the local school. To relax he used to
              watch soccer on the TV.

              Fayez was imprisoned for 6 months during the Intifada and was
              affiliated to the Hamas movement. He used to argue about politics
              with his father who would say "Do you want to bring destruction to
              this house?" Fayez would answer "Don't worry".
            </p>
            <p>
              His sister's wedding was the same day as his death. He performed
              all his duties, taking her to the hairdresser and bringing the
              chairs for her, but he never returned. He also had an appointment
              with his brother. Since? his death, his sisters refuse to go to
              weddings or parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              He was shot on Thursday 26 September 1996 at the entrance to Al
              Bireh City by 30mm explosive bullets from a helicopter. He was
              buried the next night with other martyrs. One friend recalls,
              "According to the Islamic tradition we buried him the way he died,
              without preparing his body in any way. To me he is not dead." His
              father, who dug Fayez's grave, stopped work after his death and
              now visits the site daily.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fayez was originally from Qalulina, 7 km from Jerusalem. When his
              father first took him there to visit their former home, he was
              amazed by the beauty of the place. Recovering from his
              speechlessness he asked his father, "Why did you abandon this land
              and leave it to the Israelis? It would have been much more
              honourable to die than flee."
