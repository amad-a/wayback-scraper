        <b>Dawn Visitors<br>
        </b>At the entries to capital cities I met him, </dt>
    <dt>distracted and sad, </dt>
    <dt>a man with worry lines </dt>
    <dt>that weighed him down </dt>
    <dt>like a cypress tree, drooping and silent, </dt>
    <dt>despite the winds that ruffled him </dt>
    <dt>whispering in the evenings- </dt>
    <dt>but he would not answer the wind..<br>
        </dt>
    <dt>At the gates of capital cities-I cannot name them </dt>
    <dt>but I sing their Arabic names when troubles reign- </dt>
    <dt>I call on the capitals when shells are slaughtering my
        people's </dt>
    <dt>children. I call on them, I scream, but no one </dt>
    <dt>answers. </dt>
    <dt>They've all travelled west, and north. I wish </dt>
    <dt>they'd gone east, I wish </dt>
    <dt>they'd become stars in exile, servants to strangers. </dt>
    <dt>At harvest time they sang under the pine trees </dt>
    <dt>but none of the harvests was theirs.. </dt>
    <dt>it is for those hard hearted men </dt>
    <dt>who owns the land of exile </dt>
    <dt>Don't bury me in any Arab capital, they've all tortured
        me </dt>
    <dt>for so long, </dt>
    <dt>giving me nothing but death and suffering and poverty </dt>
    <dt>and the martyred neighbors of my grave, </dt>
    <dt>those new kinsmen, for every stranger is kinsman to the
        stranger. </dt>
    <dt>No, don't bury me in any Arab capital </dt>
    <dt>at the mercy of this ordeal!<br>
        </dt>
    <dt>At the gate of the capitals I met him </dt>
    <dt>his head forever bent, </dt>
    <dt>immortal as the earth of Hebron, </dt>
    <dt>proud as the mountains of Safad. </dt>
    <dt>He was soft like old wine when it steeps inside the body.<br>
        </dt>
    <dt>I would have tempted the stars </dt>
    <dt>to accompany his beautiful departure, </dt>
    <dt>a star to guard him, and one lovely maiden </dt>
    <dt>to tend him forever. </dt>
