    <dt>Dialectics of the Homeland</dt>
    <dt>1 .</dt>
    <dt>Beyond the rainy cloud, the rose, and the pagan dream </dt>
    <dt>and remnants of the old pledge. </dt>
    <dt>The lovers are no more the lovers </dt>
    <dt>And the murderers are similarly transposed, </dt>
    <dt>O homeland, drowning in mystic symbols and in blood, </dt>
    <dt>Lost homeland! </dt>
    <dt>Teach us to exist in the age of lost things </dt>
    <dt>Teach us to unlock barred doors </dt>
    <dt>To fertilize a barren land </dt>
    <dt>Discover in you the cloud and the rose </dt>
    <dt>Illuminate the tired masses. </dt>
    <dt>Homeland of lost things, </dt>
    <dt>Teach us to conceive trees and children, </dt>
    <dt>When the promised sun and the promised wind </dt>
    <dt>Are concealed or revealed </dt>
    <dt>Teach us that the murderers are visible in you </dt>
    <dt>And the murdered invisible.<br>
        </dt>
    <dt>2. </dt>
    <dt>Glory to the dead, who dispersed among the people </dt>
    <dt>who burned: </dt>
    <dt>-Who ploughs fire? </dt>
    <dt>-They plundered all secrets. </dt>
    <dt>-Now? </dt>
    <dt>Apes huddled around the tended fire.<br>
        </dt>
    <dt>3. </dt>
    <dt>The blocked horizon rained. </dt>
    <dt>Who can dam a river between one finger and another? </dt>
    <dt>Who steals a moon that blossoms at a marriage of simple
        peasants? </dt>
    <dt>Homeland of the newborn mother, </dt>
    <dt>We have concealed a wound, exposed another </dt>
    <dt>Witnessed blood as water, water as blood, </dt>
    <dt>We did not fall, </dt>
    <dt>Beyond the rainy cloud, the rose, and the pagan dream </dt>
    <dt>bridges extend, </dt>
    <dt>beyond the noose is the lily </dt>
    <dt>green corpses pressed in the books of simple people </dt>
    <dt>and in the memory of the struggling masses. </dt>
    <dt>The peaks of death are torture and the taut tones of the
        voice </dt>
    <dt>The peaks of death are magnificent, for who can possess </dt>
    <dt>his own death lacerated by </dt>
    <dt>obstructed paths?<br>
        </dt>
</dl>
<p>4 .</p>
<p>they passed at the twilight of revolution of lost things </p>
<dl>
    <dt>Who owns the truth of death? </dt>
    <dt>The customary slates are split: </dt>
    <dt>Death without death </dt>
    <dt>Voice without voce </dt>
    <dt>Homeland without homeland. </dt>
    <dt>Only the poor, the workers, the outcasts, </dt>
    <dt>the elect at the dawn of the revolution </dt>
    <dt>remain loyal to the wound, to the truth of death, </dt>
    <dt>to the meaning of the song.<br>
        </dt>
