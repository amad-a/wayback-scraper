and was raised in Jericho. The family fled to Jordan after the 1967 invasion,
and then to Beirut after Black September 1970. Badr interrupted the studies
she began at the University of Jordan, and obtained a BA in philosophy
and psychology from the Beirut Arab University, but she was unable to complete
her MA due to the Lebanese civil war. She worked as a volunteer in various
Palestinian women's organizations, and as a field reporter and editor in
the <i>Al Hurriyya</i> review cultural section. After the 1982 Palestinian
exodus from Lebanon, she lived in Damascus, Tunis, and Amman, and returned
to Palestine in 1994. She is a married mother of two. In addition to her
literary work, she also runs the Cinema and Audiovisual department at the
