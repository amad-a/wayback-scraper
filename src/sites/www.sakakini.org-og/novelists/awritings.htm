<p><font size="+1">Shammas' first novel, <i>Arabesques</i>, was written in
Hebrew and published in 1986 in Israel to wide acclaim. The book's themes
and rich and multilayered Hebrew raised questions about Israelis' exclusive
ownership of the language, and was hailed as "a turning point in Israel's
cultural life". Among his awards and honors: the 1991-92 Whiting Award,
and the 1993 Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Writer's Award. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">A play in Arabic produced by the Arab Theatre in Israel.
It tells the story of two Palestinian-Israeli burglars who break into an
Arab apartment in a Jewish neighborhood in Haifa, in the year 2012. They
soon discover that they are locked in, and they are later joined by an
old, hunted Palestinian. The play addresses the question of blurring and
loss of identity of Palestinian-Israelis.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">* In addition, Anton Shammas has written a children's
book in Hebrew, and has translated novels, poems and plays from Hebrew
into Arabic, from Arabic into Hebrew, and from English into Arabic and
Hebrew. He has also written essays, Op-Ed pieces and book reviews for the
New York Times, The NYT Book Review, Harper's Magazine, the LA Times, etc..
Many of which were subsequently translated by a number of European journals
and reviews. </font></p>
