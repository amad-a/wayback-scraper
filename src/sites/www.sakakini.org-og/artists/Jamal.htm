His reputation grew after he was commissioned by the Islamic Waqf to renovate the burned pulpit <i>(Minbar)</i> of the Aqsa mosque, destroyed by an Israeli arsonist in 1969. 
<p></p>
<p>Badran studied Islamic art at the Hamzaoui School in Cairo from 1922 to 1927. After his return, he began working on the first major 20<sub>th</sub> century renovation of the Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques in Jerusalem from 1927 to 1928. He was sent by the British Mandate Government ruling Palestine at the time, to the UK to study at the Central College of Arts and Crafts from 1934 to 1937. He taught after his return Islamic art in many colleges. After the <i>Nakba,</i> he was forced to flee to Syria. He went to work for the UNESCO in Libya from 1952 to 1962 as an expert in art education. He returned to Palestine later that year and lived in Ramallah were he ran a workshop. He received a UNESCO award in 1994 for his work on glass.
