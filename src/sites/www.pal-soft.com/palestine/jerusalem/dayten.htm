The  Israeli Army and settlers have withdrawn from Qabr Yusuf, a small
Islamic  site  which was converted into a synagogue several years ago.
The  site has always been a central friction point between Israeli and
Palestinians  since  it  is  located  in the heart of the Arab town of
Nablus.  As  soon  as  the  site  was vacated, Palestinian youths went
inside and destroyed the buildings.
The  Israeli  army shot dead two Palestinian refugees and injured more
than twenty others during a refugee protest at Israeli massacres . The
two are Hasan Hassanein, 23, of Shatila camp , and Fadi Anas, of Bourj
Al Barajneh camp . At least 20 others have been taken to Tyre hospital
with injuries.
At  least one Palestinian was martyred and number of Palestinians were
injured  in  renewed  confrontations  between  heavily  armed  Israeli
occupation   soldiers   and   Palestinian   demonstrators   protesting
continuing  Israeli  carnage against the Palestinian people. In Gaza ,
one  Palestinian  youth  was shot dead at the Shuhada junction in Gaza
with  fifteen  other  protesters getting injured. In Tulkarm, at least
ten  people  were  injured,  four  of  sustaining  gunshot  wounds. In
Al-Khalil,  more  than  15  Palestinian  protesters  were  injured  in
confrontations in Yatta, Samou, Bani Naim and the Fawwar refugee camp.
In Jenin, six Palestinians were reported injured.
In  Southern Lebanon, Hizbullah forces captured three Israeli soldiers
as  prisoners near the Shab'a farms. The Israeli government threatened
to  bomb  the  Lebanese  capital Beirut if the three soldiers were not
released.
News  reported  that  the  Jewish General Ayora Eiland was the man who
issued  orders  for  the  killing  of  the  Palestinian child Mohammed
al-Durah  while  trying  to hide behind his father in the tragic scene
that shook the whole world.
This is some photos of what happened today.</i></b></pre>
