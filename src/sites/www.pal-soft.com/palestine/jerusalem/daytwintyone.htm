Large  marches  took  place  in Palestinian towns in the West Bank and
Gaza  Strip  ,  protesting  Sharm el-Sheikh agreement which makes most
Palestinians   feel   deeply   disappointed.   As  a  results  of  the
demonstrations , clashes with Israeli occupation soldiers continued in
many  parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the Israeli occupation
soldiers  continued to open fire at unarmed Palestinian demonstrators.
Over a hundred Palestinian injures were reported .
In  Deir  al-Balah,  near  the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom, in the
Gaza  Strip, Palestinian demonstrates throw stones in the direction of
Israeli  soldiers and the soldiers returned by live bullets and rubber
coated  steel  bullets . (Photo 1) at least 15 Palestinians protesters
were injured by Israeli soldiers fire . (Photo 2)
In  Gaza  city  ,  hundreds of Palestinian storm the streets in a huge
funeral  of a Palestinian policemen Nabel Kater, who was killed during
clashes  near  Erez, the crossing point between Palestinian-ruled Gaza
and Israel in the Gaza Strip . (Photo 3)
Thousands of Palestinians took to the streets on the West Bank voicing
their rejection of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement and vowing to keep up
the  Aqsa  Intifada  until  the  Palestinian people regain freedom and
liberation from the Jewish occupation.
In  the  West  Bank city of Ramallah , Israeli soldiers fired live and
rubber  coated  steel  bullets  against the Palestinians demonstrators
causing number of injuries . (Photo 4)
Giorgio Giacomelli A U.N. investigator mandated by the U.N. Commission
on  Human  Rights to the Palestinian territories reported the scale of
Palestinian  deaths  at  the  hands of Israeli forces during a wave of
violence  over  the  past  20  days  was  &quot;  unprecedented  .&quot; He also
expressed   concern   about   what   he   called   Israeli  settler  &quot;
paramilitaries  &quot;  who  he  said  were  responsible  for at least five
Palestinian deaths in the West Bank.
&quot;  In  some  sense the scale of this violation is unprecedented. It is
worthy  of  note that the number of deaths caused by Israeli forces so
far  approximate  the  number  killed  in the first four months of the
intifada,  in 1987-88&quot; Giacomelli said in his seven-page report issued
in  Geneva.  The report also said that Israeli forces &quot; appear to have
indiscriminately  used  excessive  force  in  cases where there was no
imminent threat to their lives. &quot;
The  report  add  that about 40 percent of an estimated 2,000 to 3,700
Palestinians  wounded  by  Israeli occupation forces were under age 18
and  that  at least half of the injuries resulted from the use of live
ammunition.
&quot;  Presently,  the  Israeli  settler  population  has  emerged  as  an
increasingly obvious source of paramilitary activity. Numerous reports
indicate  that  Israeli occupation forces have not acted to deter such
paramilitary activities &quot; Giacomelli report said.
According  to  the  report, Israel, refused to cooperate with the U.N.
investigator .
