<b>
<p align="left">Florence (Italy)</b> (Italian <i>Firenze</i>; ancient <i>Florentia</i>),
is a city, in central Italy, in Tuscany Region. It is the capital of Florence
Province, on the Arno River. Located at the foot of the Apennines Mountains,
Florence was originally the site of an Etruscan settlement. The city is world
famous for Gothic and Renaissance buildings, art galleries and museums, and
parks. In addition, it is an important commercial, transportation, and
manufacturing center. It is a market for wine, olive oil, vegetables, fruits,
and flowers, and it lies on the railroad and main highway linking northern Italy
and Rome. Manufactures include motorcycles, automotive parts, agricultural
machinery, chemicals, fertilizers, plastics, and precision instruments.
Florentine handicraft industries are traditional and famous, producing
silverwork, jewelry (especially gold and cameos), straw work, leather goods,
glass, pottery, wood carvings, furniture, and embroidery.</p>
<p align="left">The city of Florence is dominated by the towers of its many
palaces and churches and by the huge dome of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del
Fiore. There is a Gothic structure with an exterior ornately decorated with red, green,
and white marble. The cathedral is the most imposing structure on the right bank
of the Arno. Beside the cathedral stands the 14th-century campanile, or bell
tower, which was begun by Giotto and continued by Andrea Pisano. Adorned with
exquisite bas-reliefs, the campanile (82 m/269 ft high) is perhaps the most
beautiful in Italy. The octagonal baptistery of San Giovanni, facing the
cathedral, dates mainly from the 11th to the 15th century, although some parts
were built as early as the 5th century; it is noted for doors of gilded bronze,
especially the east door, called the Gate to Paradise, which was executed by the
Florentine goldsmith Lorenzo Ghiberti and depicts sculpted scenes from the Old
Testament.</p>
<p align="left">Near the cathedral is the Bargello, or Palazzo del Podest�, a
fortresslike building of the 13th and 14th centuries, which houses a National
Museum. The Piazza della Signoria, containing the Fountain of Neptune (completed
1576), is dominated by the majestic Palazzo Vecchio, or Palazzo della Signoria,
a rough and sturdy but pleasingly harmonious building surmounted by a
crenellated 94-m (308-ft) bell tower. The vast halls and state apartments are
ornately decorated in the style of the late Renaissance. Opposite is the Loggia
dell'Orcagna (late 14th century), also called Loggia dei Lanzi, a roofed
structure open at the sides, which houses a number of statues, among them the
bronze <i>Perseus</i> (completed 1554) by Benvenuto Cellini and the <i>Rape of
the Sabines</i> (1579-1583) by Giambologna.</p>
<b>
<p align="left"></b>Between the Palazzo Vecchio and the Arno stands the Palazzo
degli Uffizi, built late in the 16th century to house government offices and law
courts. It is famous for its art gallery, the Uffizi Gallery, one of the finest
in Europe, which contains an unsurpassed collection of works by the greatest
painters of Italy and a rich sampling of works by Flemish and French masters.
The nearby Ponte Vecchio, which is lined with goldsmiths' and jewelers' shops,
was built about 1350; it is the only bridge in Florence spared during World War
II and leads across the Arno to the Palazzo Pitti on the left bank. This
building contains another famous art collection, particularly rich in works by
Andrea del Sarto, Raphael, Il Perugino, Titian, and Tintoretto. Behind the Pitti
are the vast Boboli Gardens, used for outdoor concerts during the music festival
held each year in May.</p>
<p align="left">On the right bank of the Arno, in a kind of half-circle around
the cathedral and the Palazzo Vecchio, are many famous churches and palaces.
Noteworthy are the 13th-century Gothic Church of Santa Trinit�, having a fine,
luminous interior and a 16th-century baroque facade; and Santa Maria Novella
(13th-15th century), with a colored marble facade and richly decorated
cloisters, is one of the most beautiful churches in the city. Eastward are the
15th-century church and cloisters of San Lorenzo, designed by Brunelleschi. The
adjoining structure is the Medici Chapel, private chapel and burial place of the
famous Medici family. Above the crypt of the Medici Chapel is the New Sacristy,
for which Michelangelo was both architect and sculptor; the sacristy contains
the tombs of Lorenzo II de' Medici, duke of Urbino, with figures of <i>Dawn</i>
and <i>Twilight</i>; and of Giuliano de' Medici, duke of Nemours, with figures
of <i>Day</i> and <i>Night</i> (1520-34).</p>
<p align="left">The Palazzo Medici-Riccardi, built by Michelozzo for Cosimo de'
Medici in the mid-15th century, faces San Lorenzo across a large piazza. It is
typical
of the residences built by prominent families in this period. It houses the
Medici Museum. A few streets to the northeast is the former Dominican monastery
of San Marco, also largely the work of Michelozzo. It is now a museum in which
are preserved the works of the two monks and painters Fra Angelico and Fra
Bartolommeo, as well as the cell once occupied by the preacher and reformer
Girolamo Savonarola. Nearby are the Gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts, housing
many works of Michelangelo, including his <i>David</i> (1501-1504); and the
Archaeological Museum, with an outstanding Etruscan collection.</p>
<p align="left">Southward, near the Arno, stands the handsome Franciscan Church
of Santa Croce. This church is called the Pantheon of Florence because it
contains the tombs of Michelangelo, the statesman and political philosopher
Niccol</font><font face="Times New Roman (Arabic)">�</font><font face="Arial">
Machiavelli, the poet and dramatist Conte Vittorio Alfieri, and the opera
composer Gioacchino Antonio Rossini, as well as monuments to many other noted
Italians.</p>
<p align="left">Florence contains one of the greatest libraries in Italy, the
Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, with approximately 4 million books and pamphlets
and many thousands of manuscripts, maps, and letters. Other libraries are the
Laurentian Library, the Marucelliana and Riccardiana libraries, and the
Moreniana, which is particularly important for local history. Thousands of
documents pertaining to the history of Florence and Tuscany are preserved in the
State Archives. The University of Florence, established in 1923, is the
successor of an institution chartered in 1321. Florence is the seat also of a
noted conservatory of music and of the Istituto Geografico Militare, which is
world famous for fine mapmaking.</p>
<b>
<p align="left">History :</b>Although Florence was founded in ancient times, it
was of little importance before the 11th century. By the second half of that
century it was governed by a council composed of nobles and learned men that
nominally functioned in the name of the people, thus making the city a republic.</p>
<p align="left">Florence was the capital of Italy under King Victor Emmanuel
from 1865 to 1871, when Rome became the capital. In World War II most of
Florence's monuments were not damaged, but all its bridges (except the Ponte
Vecchio) were destroyed in 1944. In 1966 a major flood damaged numerous art
treasures in Florence, but many were restored in succeeding years by the use of
sophisticated techniques. Population (1991) 403,294.</font>
