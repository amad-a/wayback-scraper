Other maps showing the location of Qalqilya, include one of the West Bank, one of Israel/Palestine and even a world map!  Qalqilya has the distinction of being the only place in the West Bank or Gaza Strip with a zoo, although no information is available about it yet. Would you want to visit Qalqilya? If you are the sort of tourist who wants to see Palestine as it is, why not! <b> Added to Complete Guide: 21 December 1997.</b> <a href="#top">Top of page.</a></font><br><br><br>
