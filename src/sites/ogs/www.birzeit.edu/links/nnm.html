Beautifully organised and beautifully presented.   It offers the main news stories, plus an archive full of older articles and stories which are all available online, organised into sections such as "Eye on Jerusalem," "Eye on Amman," "Israeli Affairs," etc.  These articles are mostly in Arabic, but there is also a smaller section for English articles.  There are links to jounalists' homepages, a guestbook, AND an Arabic chatroom!!!

The problem of Arabic language compatability on the Web has been solved by scanning text as images. Some people here prefer Al-Ayyam because it offers a more independent outlook than Al-Quds.

The photodiary logs the realities of the peace process primarily after the Oslo 2 redeployment in the area where Nigel lived and worked - the Palestinian Area A town of Ramallah, the Area B village of Birzeit and the Birzeit University community. Nigel has added new sections including a <i>Birzeit Diary</i> and <i>Media Diary</i>. Other sections include the <i>Intifada Diary: Ten Years After</i>, <i>Closure Diary</i> and the <i>Palestinian Authority Diary</i>.  He has also expanded other parts including an incredible 400% increase in material in the <i>On the Ground In Ramallah</i> section covering the clashes of September 1996. This really is one of the best and most accessible resources concerning the Palestinian situation today. It is attractive, easy to navigate, and its contents will have you enthralled for hours. Two other additions really deserve comment - a new mirror site at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815100429/http://www.nigelparry.com/">http://www.nigelparry.com</a>, and a discussion board to post questions and opinions on the site. This site should not become just another bookmark, but must be read from "cover to cover".  Nigel is currently looking for funding for a project based on the <i>Diary</i> - go and look at this site for more information.<b>Review last updated: 2 December 1998.</b> <a href="#top">Top of page.</a></font><br><br><br>
