A groovy purple and black Depeche-Mode style kicks in this website for the Academic Freedom First Campaign. Based at Birzeit University, the AFF aims to win Gaza students the right to freedom of movement and education. Heaps of good information, personal testimonies, and ways you can get involved.

An attractively designed site with lots of information about Palestinian prisoners. This is the place to go for statistics about prisoners and their living conditions. It has campaign ideas and Arabic text available as well. They registered their own domain name in November 1998 and have really taken up the use of the web in the right way.

A human rights organization active around the unrecognized Arab villages inside the 1948 borders. These villages lack basic services and infrastructure and are not recognized by the state of Israel despite the fact they are populated by thousands of Palestinians. This website is full of information and comes in three languages, Arabic, English and Hebrew. It�s attractive, the content is well-written and informative, and it has a sense of humour- see for example the comment "A lot of text, huh? well, we have a lot of problems."

They are also building an on-line Oral History section, which unlike other sites that promise the same, actually contains content.
