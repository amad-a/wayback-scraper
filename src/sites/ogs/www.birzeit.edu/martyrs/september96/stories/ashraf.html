            /><br /><font size="1" color="DARKBLUE"><b>Right: Ashraf.</b></font>
            <p>
              Ashraf was an excellent student at school and his teachers
              remember him as a clever and good pupil. However, like many
              Palestinians he had to make a choice after 9th grade - either to
              help his father financially by getting work or to continue his
              studies at school. He chose the first and found work as a
              blacksmith, the same profession as his father. Ashraf asked his
              father for permission to get married and to open his own
              blacksmith's shop but he was told he must wait for his elder
              brother to get married first. He used to say to his father "I want
              to have my own workshop so that I can compete with you and show
              you how skilled I am!"
            </p>
            <p>
              Ashraf's relatives also remember him as well behaved and kind. He
              was particularly close to his uncle and grandmother. His
              grandmother said in tears, "He used to call me mama, kiss my hand
              and head, and sleep in my lap." He made her a small fireplace as a
              present. When she remembers it, she gets sad and moves away from
              the fireplace so as not to see it anymore. His uncle said, "I was
              really affected by his death. I raised him as if he was my own
              son."
            </p>
            <p>
              His mother remembers his favorite foods - stuffed squash and
              chicken, "He loved to watch TV, especially war movies, but he also
              liked the outdoors. I remember once taking him to the beach. We
              stayed there until late and when I told him to leave he said, 'I
              want to stay in the sea like a fish.' He was a good swimmer. He
              used to dive in and out of the water pretending to be a fish. He
              also enjoyed playing soccer and practicing karate."
            </p>
            <p>
              Ashraf had a deep love for Palestine. He would say during the
              Intifada "Why are we sitting here? Let's go and die. It's better
              than this oppression." Once during the Intifada his house was
              surrounded for 4 hours by soldiers. Ashraf , only 9 at the time,
              ran out of the house. He grabbed the leg of one of the soldiers
              and pulled him to the ground, knocking his radio from his hands.
              Eventually the soldiers broke into the house, throwing tear gas
              bombs.
            </p>
            <p>
              On Wednesday 25 September 1996 (?), his uncle told him that they
              would not be working today as it was the first day of clashes in
              Gaza. Ashraf said: " Let's go to work, and if anything happens we
              will act as everyone else does."
            </p>
            <p>
              During the morning someone told them that their little brother, 9
              years old, had been killed in the clashes. Ashraf left the
              workshop on the day of the clashes and, with an iron bar in his
              hand, joined the demonstration against the occupation. His father,
              uncle and the rest of the family followed later. They found Ashraf
              helping the injured and they joined him. At that moment, an
              Israeli helicopter started shooting and people started to run in
              all directions, losing each other. The uncle started to look for
              Ashraf, helping people who were injured at the same time. When he
              couldn't find him, he went to search in another area but was still
              unable to find him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, his uncle and his father went to the hospital and checked
              the injured to see if Ashraf was amongst them. However, Ashraf
              didn't have his identity card on him, so they could not find him
              on the list of injured or killed. His father entered the morgue to
              see if he could identify his son among the martyrs, but he
              couldn't stand the sight of bodies and blood everywhere. He asked
              Ashraf's uncle to look, and he recognized Ashraf because of the
              calouses on his hands.
            </p>
            <p>
              The witnesses at the site said that Ashraf was present while a
              Palestinian policeman, Khalil Nseir, was shot. As Ashraf ran to
              try to help the policeman, he was shot in the head and died
              instantly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ashraf's little brother, Mahmoud, 8 years old, remembers: "He used
              to bring us anything we wanted. Especially during celebrations,
              when he used to buy us all new clothes." His little sister Yasmin
              cried and ran away when asked about him.
