            <p>
              Sami was strong-willed and a natural leader. Even at school he had
              shown his leadership ability - taking responsibility for the
              school scouts while he was studying.
            </p>
            <p>
              He could also be stubborn, his family remembered. When he spoke
              with his mother about marriage, he would constantly tell her that
              he would do it his own way, instead of in the traditional manner.
              "I will get engaged by myself and will not allow you to choose for
              me."
            </p>
            <p>
              Sami left school after 9th grade because of the financial
              situation of the family. He was the third youngest in a family of
              seven children and his father had become ill after donating one of
              his kidneys to his mother. To Sami's great sorrow, his mother died
              only two months before his own death. His family told of how he
              had cried alone in his room but hid his tears whenever anyone
              entered.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sami went to work as an electrician and his grandmother recalled
              him saying, "I left school because I needed to feed my brothers,
              sisters and grandfather."
            </p>
            <p>
              " He used to buy me sweets," one of his sisters remembers, "and
              even when I said I don't want them: 'Give them to your brothers
              and sisters!', he would say: 'Don't worry, I'll feed them even if
              I have to beg.'" When he was at school he wanted to be a doctor
              but after leaving school early he used to say, half-joking and
              half-serious, "My brothers, sisters and grandmother are the best
              school I can have."
            </p>

            <p>
              His grandmother says that Sami used to wake up very early to go to
              work. Whenever she would ask him to take a break, he would refuse,
              telling her, "Do you think I can leave my father to beg? No. I
              won't do it."
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              He was close to his grandmother, whose husband had been killed by
              the Israelis in 1956. She is now 75, and remembers fondly how
              whenever Sami saw her sad or lost in thought, he would tell her,
              "Don't worry grandmother - we'll marry you off to someone!"
            </p>
            <p>
              In his spare time, Sami would help his father farm a small plot of
              land. His father remembers Sami as always ready for a laugh, "I
              often told him off for this, telling him, 'You are a man - you
              must be serious!'"
            </p>
            <p>
              Sami's little brothers still ask their grandmother, "When Sami was
              here he used to bring us sweets. Why isn't father doing the same?"
              She tells them, "Your father is sick and cannot afford sweets for
              you like your brother."

              His family had a long experience of suffering caused by the
              Israeli occupation. His brother Ismail, 27, was injured in his leg
              during the intifada and still suffers pain in his knee. His
              25-year-old brother Ayman was arrested twice, the first time for
              three months and the second time for two years.

            <p>
              Once, during the Intifada, Sami was wearing a mask in the street
              during some protests. A neighbour, who was mute, recognised Sami
              even behind the mask and told Sami's father. When his father faced
              him, Sami denied he had been in the streets. So his father called
              the mute neighbour to confront Sami. He used sign language to
              insist that he recognised Sami and then Sami turned to face his
              father, telling him, " I don't understand a word of what he says."
            </p>
            <p>
              In his spare time Sami liked to watch Arabic serials and soccer on
              TV. He also enjoyed patriotic songs. One of his favourite hobbies
              was looking after goldfish. He used to eat everything - never
              refusing any kind of meal.

            <br />
            <p>
              On the day of his death, Sami came back from work early because of
              an argument he had with his boss. He told his uncle that he would
              stay at home for the rest of the day. But minutes later he left
              the house with his cousin, leaving his ID and documents. What
              suprised his uncle the most was that he didn't finish drinking his
              tea even though he loved it very much.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sami's father was in Jordan. When he heard about the clashes he
              phoned to make sure that his sons were okay. "Yes father," they
              answered, "everything is fine." They still did not know about
              Sami's death because he had not had his documents on him when he
              was killed and had not yet been identified.
            </p>
            <p>
              They only discovered his death in the evening, while they were
              following the developments on TV and saw the picture of his dead
              body. Near the settlements of Netzarim, where the clashes
              occurred, he was shot from a very short distance with live
              ammunition in the chest and died instantly.
