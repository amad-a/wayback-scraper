      Upcoming Israeli Supreme Court hearing,Wednesday Jan. 13th 1999 in front
      of a nine-judge panel regarding 3 principal petition of the Public
      Committee Against Torture, 1 petition of the Association for Civil Rights
      in Israel, 1 Petition of Attorney Andre Rosenthal and 1 petition of
      Hamoked - Center for the Defense of the Individual on the legality of the
      use "moderate physical pressure" during interrogation of Palestinian
      detainees by the Israel General Security Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      Following the invitation of the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel
      (PCATI), <br />Amnesty International observer form London, Joanna
      Oyediran, will attend the court hearing,
    </p>

    <p>
      Yesterday PCATI, submitted to the Israeli Supreme Court a sworn statement
      of Robert Nigh Jr., the attorney for Timothy James McVeigh, accused of
      causing the Oklahoma city bombing in 1995 in which 168 people were
      killed.&nbsp; It was the largest terrorist attack ever committed upon
      American soil.&nbsp; In his affidavit, Attorney Nigh described, how
      despite the imminent threat of further bombings, US interrogators did not
      use any physical force and allowed Attorney Nigh to be present during the
      entire interrogation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, PCATI submitted a report by the Psychiatrist Dr. Avi Raps
      regarding the long-term devastating effects suffered by 14 Palestinians,
      aged between 26-28, who were interrogated by the GSS during and after the
      Intifada.
    </p>

    <p>
      The committee also submitted to the court, research regarding different
      interrogation methods of detainees, suspected in terrorist activities, in
      Britain and the USA where torture is never used.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over a thousand Palestinians are interrogated and tortured annually by the
      Israeli General Security Services (“GSS”) through severe physical and
      psychological methods. GSS interrogation methods include forced squatting,
      tying up detainees in contorted positions for long periods, handcuffing
      them to pipes, violently shaking their heads and bodies, shackling them
      for many hours in tight handcuffs and squeezing their arms and legs,
      forcing them to eat off bathroom floors, covering their heads with a wet
      and/or stinking sack, solitary confinement, exposure to extreme cold and
      heat, sleep denial for days, exposing them to blaring loud music 24 hours
      a day.&nbsp; The UN Committee Against Torture declared in 1998 that these
      methods constitute torture and called on Israel to refrain form using
      these methods.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the past several years, PCATI filed several principal Petitions to
      the Israeli High court of Justice challenging the legality of these
      interrogation methods. On Jan. 13th, the Israeli High Court will hold a
      hearing in front of nine-judge panel to hear oral arguments by PCATI and
      the State on these petitions.&nbsp; The case is expected to be seminal;
      its outcome will determine whether torture is legal or illegal in Israel.
