    Mr. Hisham Abdel Razik, Palestinian Minister of Prisoners' Affairs, headed a
    delegation from the Ex-Detainees Rehabilitation Program in a visit to
    GCMHP.&nbsp; The guests met Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj, Mr. Ahmad Abu Tawahina, Mr.
    Husam El-Nounou, and Mr. Saber El-Neirab.&nbsp; The visiting delegation
    talked about the activities of the Ministry in the helping Palestinian
    prisoners in Israeli jails and their families.
    <p>
      In addition, the meeting discussed the possibilities of cooperation
      between the Ministry and GCMHP in supporting Palestinian prisoners in
      Israeli prisons through: <br />&nbsp;- Exposing Israeli human rights
      violations against prisoners in the local and international media.
      <br />&nbsp;- Involve international human rights organizations in lobbying
      for Palestinian prisoners' rights and release. <br />&nbsp;- Exposing the
      racism of the Israeli judicial system.
    </p>

    <p>
      The guests also requested GCMHP's assistance in securing funding for the
      Ex-detainees Rehabilitation Program in order for it to conduct its various
      activities supporting prisoners and their families.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moreover, Dr. El-Sarraj suggested forming a "Palestinian Prisoners'
      Support Committee" from local and international figures and organizations
      to study ways of enhancing support to Palestinian prisoners and starting
      income-generating projects to provide employment for ex-detainees.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, both sides agreed to continue cooperation in the area of
      providing psychosocial support to prisoners, ex-detainees, and their
      families.
