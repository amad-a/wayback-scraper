      On 25 August, the President of the GCMHP Board of Directors, Dr. Eyad
      El-Sarraj, met the Dutch Foreign Minister, Mr. Jozias van Aartsen, in the
      presidential guest palace in Gaza.&nbsp; Mr. Aartsen and Dr. El-Sarraj
      discussed the impasse in the peace process and agreed on the historic
      chance to bring peace to the Middle East after decades of war and
      conflict.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dr. Eyad stressed the vital role of the EU and Holland in bringing about a
      just and lasting peace based on the respect of international law and
      resolutions. He also expressed his fear that this historic chance would be
      missed as a result of Israeli policies that will throw the region back
      into conflict.&nbsp; Dr. El-Sarraj emphasized that progress in the peace
      process should be parallel to building a democratic Palestinian society
      that respects human rights and the law. In this regard, Dr. El-Sarraj
      asked the Dutch Government to increase its support of the Palestinian
      Authority and non-governmental organizations, especially those working in
      the field of human rights.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dr. El-Sarraj highlighted the Israeli human rights violations over the
      past three decades and the human rights violations in the Palestinian
      areas.&nbsp; He also accentuated the importance of respecting people’s
      basic rights, mentioning amongst other rights the right to freedom of
      expression and political affiliation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dr. El-Sarraj thanked Mr. Aartsen for his visit and for the Dutch support
      of Palestinian institutions. Mr. Aartsen agreed to increase the Dutch
      support to some of the GCMHP projects.&nbsp; He also invited Dr. El-Sarraj
      to visit the Netherlands at a time to be determined later.
