      >The visit took place in the context of the project with TPO (
      Transcultural Psychological Organization-Holland). There were many aims
      for the visit:</font
    >
    <ul>
      <li>
        <font color="#000066"
          >To present the initial results of the Epidemiological Study conducted
          in Gaza in collaboration with TPO.</font
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <font color="#000066"
          >To participate in designing another multi-site study proposal on
          Psycho-social interventions, in which GCMHP will participate.</font
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <font color="#000066"
          >To design a book on the TPO projects worldwide. Dr. Elmasri was
          chosen to be the first author on the Gaza project. The book is
          expected to be ready in final form for printing next year.</font
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <font color="#000066"
      >Dr. Joop De Jong, director of TPO-Holland, chaired the meeting. He is a
      Professor in the Free University of Amsterdam, and is well known for his
      work in transcultural Psychiatry. He worked as a psychiatrist in different
      countries in the third world, and initiated community mental health
      projects.</font
    >
    <br /><font color="#000066"
      >Dr. Robert Giel, also a well known psychiatrist advised and commented on
      the interventions. He is very well known in Gaza since the early days of
      GCMHP in 1990, and has assisted in training the GCMHP professionals.</font
    >
    <br /><font color="#000066"
      >The participants were project directors and administrators of the TPO
      projects in Nepal, Uganda, Ethiopia, Congo, Cambodia, and two invited
      mental health professionals from Algeria, who were interested in starting
      a Mental health project in their country. Project directors presented the
      latest developments in their countries and projects. A general direction
      towards more advanced and standardized intervention programs was evident
      from the presentations.</font
    >
    <br /><font color="#000066"
      >In Nepal, Dr. El Masri presented the latest statistics on the work in
      GCMHP, including the work done in the areas of community and clinical
      interventions, children, and rehabilitation. He also presented a lecture
      on the rational of outreach preventive interventions in the area of
      Community Mental Health. In the context of the meeting, the standard
      clinical procedures and documentation of the GCMHP were presented for the
      other projects. The audience found the presentations very informative and
      requested further detailed information on the Programme activities. Many
      of the participants found the work in GCMHP as a model to be followed, and
      expressed their wish to visit the Programme.</font
