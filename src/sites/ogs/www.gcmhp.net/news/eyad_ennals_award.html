      On 27 November 1998, the ceremony for the 5th Martin Ennals Award for
      Human Rights Defenders was held in the Conference Hall in Geneva.&nbsp;
      The recipient of the award was Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj, the first Arab to earn
      this prestigious award.&nbsp; A large number of human rights activists,
      high court judges, parliamentarians, members of the British House of
      Lords, members of Amnesty International, and members of the International
      Commission of Jurists attended the ceremony.
    </p>

    <p>
      <font color="#000000">Ms. Simia Ahmadi</font> started the ceremony by
      giving a short introduction about the award.&nbsp; He paid tribute to
      Martin Ennals, a founding member and first Secretary-General of Amnesty
      International and founder of other human rights organizations such as the
      International Association for the Prevention of Torture and Article 19.

    <p>
      Mr. Adama Dieng then announced the recipients of the 1998 Martin Ennals
      award for human <br />rights defenders, Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj. Mr. Dieng
      mentioned that the award was presented to Dr. El-Sarraj in recognition of
      his courageous and innovative human rights work and of the international
      voice that he has given to Palestinian’s human rights and pro-democracy
      movement. <br /><a href="#adama"

      Mr. Kofi Kumado followed Mr. Adama Dieng by introducing Dr. Eyad
      El-Sarraj.&nbsp; Mr. Kumado said numerous things made Dr. El-Sarraj the
      first candidate to receive the award this year. <br />After the
      introduction, Mr. Kumado presented Dr. El-Sarraj with the Martin Ennals
      Award for Human Rights Defenders, which consisted of a trophy and a
      financial grant. <br /><a href="#kofi"

          >MARTIN ENNALS: A GIANT HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDER</font
        ></b
      >
    </center>
    <p>
      I never met Martin Ennals in person. Well, neither did I personally know
      Mozart or Ghandi, but it does not prevent me from being inspired by them,
      for they have left a legacy behind. And so has Ennals.
    </p>

    <p>
      I first heard about Martin from Hans Thoolen in 1992 who mentioned that he
      wanted to pursue the idea to create an award in the name of Martin, not
      only to commemorate him, but to encourage human rights defenders. I asked
      to see the files on the award proposal so that I could begin to learn
      about Martin. My curiosity about this giant HRD had certainly been
      sparked. Who exactly was Martin? What was his background? How did he help
      to create this vast movement of human rights NGOs? And most
      important:&nbsp; how did he inspire so many others?
    </p>

    <p>
      Martin Ennals devoted his whole life to human rights and nothing else. His
      dynamic dedication may have taken different forms, and may have been
      channeled through a variety of human rights organisations - whatever the
      vehicle used, there was always a single orientation: human rights. As a
      colleague noted: “He moved mountains, doing and creating impossible
      things. Martin was always ten years ahead of his time”. The enormous
      creativity of Martin, the pursuing of ideas ahead of his times made me
      think of Mark Twain’s words: “A crank is a man with an idea..... until it
      catches on.” He was behind the creation or growth of at least ten
      organisations which span the full spectrum of human rights, each
      specialising in their own mandates, be it the development of a big
      machinery for protecting the rights of individuals through AI, the
      prevention and solution of conflicts through International Alert, freedom
      of expression through Article 19, the use of appropriate information
      technology through HURIDOCS, or general standard setting within the UN.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Martin became Secretary General of AI in 1968, AI was an organisation
      with 7 staff and an annual budget of &pound;17'000.&nbsp; Twelve years
      later, the staff had grown to 150 with an annual budget of &pound;2
      million.&nbsp; Martin represented an era where AI became a human rights
      organisation of global concern, and an international player in the human
      rights field.&nbsp; It is no coincidence, then, that AI was awarded the
      Erasmus Prize in 1976, the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, and the UN Human
      Rights Award in 1978. But Martin, known for his modesty, had others accept
      the prizes on behalf of AI.
    </p>

    <p>
      Martin was convinced of the need for AI to become a strong campaign
      organisation, not just an organisation that documents human rights
      violations.&nbsp; Under his leadership, the first campaign on torture took
      place in 1973 as well as the first campaign against the death penalty in
      1977. Martin cited his reasons for leaving AI in 1980: “I thought that no
      organisation should become identified with one person and that no
      individual gives his best after a certain period of time in one post.”
      Martin retained close contact with AI during his whole life.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1982, at the birth of the HURIDOCS network, Martin wrote:&nbsp; “The
      rapid increase of interest in human rights coincides with the rapid
      development of information technology. Unless a common and universal
      system of communication is evolved, valuable information will be wasted,
      existing international machinery will not function, and implementation not
      monitored.” This is how he married information technology and human rights
      protection. Hence it should come as no surprise that HURIDOCS is proud to
      be the home of the MEA for Human Rights Defenders. With human rights
      treaties being available on internet, with many human rights organisations
      now having a “home page” on the “web”, it is perhaps good to recall that
      the words just quoted were probably typed by Martin on his old, battered
      portable typewriter which he carried around the globe, with the same
      dedication as his flask of whiskey.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was active in the creation of both SOS Torture and Defence for Children
      International.&nbsp; From there, he moved to establish Article 19, and his
      last creation, International Alert.&nbsp; He himself remarked that it was
      fitting to go full circle from AI to IA, from on organisation focusing on
      the individual, to one that emphasised events.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to colleagues and family, Martin Ennals not only had devotion to
      human rights work, but he also had a strong love of life, of people, of
      fun. Martin was always able to tell the woods from the trees, always
      willing to see the individual distinct from the movement or the cause. He
      had the ability to put everything human rights defenders are doing in a
      meaningful global context. This made Martin the quintessential NGO
      networker. Martin&nbsp; died on 5 October&nbsp; 1991 in Saskatoon Canada
      where he was serving a human rights fellowship with special emphasis on
      the right to self-determination.&nbsp; He left behind a world filled with
      many more - and more vigorous - human rights organtisations than had been
      found 64 years earlier, although he himself would never have claimed to
      have played a major role in that formidable change.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we celebrate 50 years of the UDHR, let me recall the words of Pierre
      San&eacute;, current Secretary-General of AI: “Defending human rights
      defenders today has to be imperative for all international human rights
      organisations in order to create the political and social space where the
      future of all societies can be addressed without fear.”
    </p>

    <p>
      It is with this in mind that the MEF has recently agreed to make its
      governing structure the joint responsibility of a broad range of
      international human rights NGOs. Nine such organisations have now joined
      hands to make the MEA into an effective tool for the protection of
      HRDs.&nbsp; Martin Ennals, who more than anyone else&nbsp; wanted to see
      effective cooperation among human rights activists, would certainly be
      proud of this joint enterprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you…&nbsp; The short excerpts of the film on the life of Martin that
      you have seen are taken from the film made by AI-Netherlands - Willem
      Offenberg and Rob Brouwer - and the MEF. The portraits of the first four
      MEA winners that follow were also made by the same team.

    </p>

    <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
    <p>
      It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to the fifth Martin Ennals
      Human Rights&nbsp; Award for Human Rights Defenders ceremony.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Award ceremony takes place at a time of great expectations and hope.
      In a world plagued by human rights violations, success&nbsp; of human
      rights awareness and&nbsp; the ideals of freedom, justice and peace in the
      world can only be accomplished&nbsp; through the joint endeavours of all
      concerned. If the cause of peace is truly to gain momentum, it must rest
      upon sound foundation of respect for human rights and freedoms. It is in
      the light of this concept that the Martin Ennals Foundation presents its
      Award today.
    </p>

    <p>
      As many of you will already know, Martin always showed great sensitivity
      for the plight of the persecuted, the underprivileged and victims of
      discrimination. He had a lot of sympathy&nbsp; for grass roots work and he
      always made a point of&nbsp; stressing the comprehensive nature and the
      broad range of human rights as exemplified&nbsp; by the Universal
      Declaration&nbsp; of Human Rights, which includes civil, political rights,
      as well as social rights and social justice. Martin felt strongly that
      political freedom and social justice go hand in hand and was a strong
      believer of human rights education training.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a member of the jury that had to select the final candidates for this
      year’s award, I can honestly say that it was a very difficult choice as
      many of the candidates being considered were of high and equal standing.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is with great pleasure that I announce that the laureate of the 1998
      Martin Ennals&nbsp; Award for human rights defenders is Dr. Eyad El
      Sarraj. This Award will be presented to him&nbsp; in recognition of his
      courageous and innovative human rights work and of the international voice
      that he has given to Palestinian’s human rights and pro-democracy
      movement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dr. Eyad Rajab El Sarraj is the founder and Medical Director of the Gaza
      Community Mental Health Program (GCMHP). Dr. El Sarraj has developed an
      independent mental health service which provides urgently needed support
      for the large number of people affected by the upheaval of the Intifada
      and the organised violence perpetrated under Israeli occupation. He is
      active in the fields of rehabilitation of torture survivors and prevention
      of torture. His open criticism of the Palestinian National Authorities has
      placed him in great danger. It resulted in his arrest on three occasions,
      most recently in June 1996, where he has experienced torture, prolonged
      solitary confinement and lack of access to an attorney. Dr. El Sarraj also
      participates in prevention of torture world-wide as a member of the
      International Rehabilitation Centre for Torture Victims, and the
      Co-ordinating Committee of the Campaign Against Torture in the Middle East
      and North Africa.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eyad’s&nbsp; courage and perseverance in his human rights activities&nbsp;
      in the face of constant repression, torture, death threats of the
      Palestinian people who refuse the Israeli occupation and personal attacks
      has made of him a forceful and forthright human rights campaigner. These
      qualities were only a small part of&nbsp; the many characteristics&nbsp;
      that persuaded the&nbsp; Jury to select&nbsp; him as the second laureate
      of the Martin Ennals Award for Human rights defenders.
    </p>

    <p>
      In conclusion,&nbsp; it is my hope that the presentation of this Award
      will encourage other human rights activists to continue their work for
      peace and&nbsp; co-operation. Indeed, it is important to assure the
      success of an active human rights movement and ensure that the continuous
      support and untiring efforts of all activists be a joint endeavour to make
      a noticeable difference in the coming years.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would&nbsp; like to take this opportunity to&nbsp; extend the
      Foundation’s gratitude&nbsp; to the Diakonische Werke - EKD (the German
      Envangelical Churches) for its generous and continuing support of the
      Martin Ennals Award, the Netherlands section of Amnesty International,
      IMADR Japan, Robert Fulghum and Lynn Edwards from USA for their
      contribution.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks also to the hosts of the “Centre
      International de Conference de Gen&egrave;ve” for hosting this Award
      ceremony.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally I want to thank HURIDOCS, its Director and the entire staff who
      actively contributed in the preparations of this momentous ceremony.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you.</p>

    <p>Distinguished Guest, Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
    <p>
      Fifty years ago, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal
      Declaration of Human Rights. Not unanimously but by a very large majority.
      The lack of unanimity was a warning that the cause of serving humanity
      will remain a complex one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Though not presented in the form of a legally binding international
      convention, the Universal Declaration was accepted as a common standard of
      decency for all the world. It provided the foundation for the highly
      commendable activity of the United Nations in the field of Human Rights. A
      commitment by the international community, which has resulted in the
      creation of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and
      all the specialised agencies which form the complex of the UN family.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, all of that belong to the public sphere. They relate to the
      public authorities world-wide. As we all know, the public authorities, in
      any country, are beholden to politics. In this field, the first law is
      that of survival of power-wielders. In turn, this need for survival has
      turned politics into what is termed the art of the possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;The Universal Declaration also spawned a different kind of
      activity.&nbsp; It galvanised civil society and civil society groups
      across our globe into frenetic activity in the service of Human Rights.
      The Declaration provided hope for many ordinary people, women and men,
      scattered across the face of this earth, and working often in unstable and
      dangerous conditions. It provided them with a Manifesto and a raison
      d'&ecirc;tre. Through their selfless devotion to Human Rights and the
      activities carried through the NGO community, the Universal Declaration
      became truly the new Magna Carta for humanity.
    </p>

    <p>
      But while governments provide each other with recognition, the
      foot-soldiers of the real human rights movement go largely unsung. Their
      death in the line of duty often evokes only silence. Their tireless
      toiling goes unheralded. They endure torture, pain, deprivation and all
      manner of unimaginable hardships. They did not ask for relief or
      compensation for themselves. They are driven simply by the desire to
      eliminate or at least alleviate suffering for others. They try to bring
      hope to the many who see the promised land of peace, security and dignity
      as a great fraud. They try to illumine where all is darkness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Martin Ennals was one of those foot-soldiers. And as is typical of these
      foot soldiers, only death retired him from active service.
    </p>

    <p>
      In June 1993, the world-wide human rights movement, in their meeting which
      preceded the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna,
      took a historic and decisive step.&nbsp; It accepted the establishment of
      the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders. It was a fitting
      tribute to Martin Ennals' memory that the acknowledgement itself was
      caught in the tumult that engulfed the closing stages of the NGO
      Conference in Vienna.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since its institution, the Award has followed the fortunes of Human Rights
      Defenders. The road for the Award has, to put it mildly, been less than
      smooth. To tell the truth, the Award has been dogged by uncertainty.
      Perhaps, it will not be considered as spoiling the party if I use this
      occasion to appeal to friends of Human Rights Defenders to do everything
      they can to save the Award from being drowned and derailed by lack of
      resources. For, to the best of my knowledge, there is no other human
      rights award that seeks to console, rekindle the hope and provide a
      rallying point for the real human rights workers. It will be a great pity
      if the Award should suffer an untimely death.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, we are gathered here to present the Award to its 5th recipient. Mr.
      Adama Dieng, President of the Martin Ennals Foundation has explained the
      factors which influenced the selection of the winner we are about to
      honour.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dr. Eyad Rajab El Sarraj is the founder and Medical Director of the Gaza
      Community Mental Health Program. He works in one of the most difficult and
      complex parts of the world.&nbsp; Piloting his ship between the waters of
      the Israeli authorities and the Palestinian National Authority has caused
      him violence, torture, arrest, prolonged solitary confinement and personal
      deprivation of all sorts. Totally oblivious to personal safety concerns,
      he has developed a service which seeks to bring hope, rehabilitation and
      stability to others. Above all, he has tried to share his unique
      experiences, skills and expertise with other human rights activists and
      advocates in other parts of the world. Martin Ennals would be proud of
      him.
    </p>

    <p>Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
    <p>
      On behalf of the Martin Ennals Foundation, on behalf the millions of
      unsung human rights workers world-wide, on behalf of all of you gathered
      here at this ceremony and on my own behalf, it is my honour and privilege
      to present the 5th Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders, in this
      fiftieth year of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
      to Dr Eyad El Sarraj.
    </p>

    <p>
      May this presentation serve as a rallying point not only for Dr. El Sarraj
      but for all of us human rights workers wherever we may be in this global
      village of ours
    </p>

    <p>THANK YOU</p>

      of the persons I left behind in prison.&nbsp; He said to me, when I was
      about to be released: &laquo;Don’t forget me... please... don’t forget
      me&raquo;.
    </p>

    <p>
      And in the detention centres which I have to visit in my capacity as the
      Commissioner General for Human Rights in Palestine, a position which also
      put me in detention, in every prison; in every detention centre I visit in
      Israel or Palestine, I always call out, with these haunting memories of
      the sounds of people bleeding, &laquo; don’t forget me... &raquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      In this world, in this troubled world, the real champions are the ones who
      sacrificed their lives, who sacrificed their lives by death, through
      torture or mistreatment, or sacrificed their lives behind bars for others
      to enjoy a normal life.&nbsp; I feel indebted and really humble because I
      received this award.&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that such a prestigious and
      symbolic award should be given to all people who still suffer at the hands
      of dictatorial regimes, of occupation forces, of military forces that
      always mean to degrade human beings and to deprive them of their dignity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The struggle is going on and this hour will only sharpen my resolution and
      my commitment to continue and I will always remember this ceremony, these
      faces, with a sense of responsibility; that we have to carry on, and I’m
      sure that one day human rights will win.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you very much.</p>
