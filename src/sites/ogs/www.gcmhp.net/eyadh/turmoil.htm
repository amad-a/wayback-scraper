          arrests of Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists by the Palestinian
          National authority (PNA) in early November. Even though many local
          observers had predicted the eruption of violence among Palestinians
          all were shocked by the events of Friday, November 18, when up to 14
          Palestinian were killed and some 200 wounded in a day-long battle with
          the Palestinian police around Gaza City.</font

          polarization between opposing political stances, as more people become
          disillusioned with the “peace process.” The chronic stress of life
          under a brutal Israeli occupation has conditioned the popular mood to
          swing sharply between euphoria and depression in reaction to events.
          Palestinians’ expectations of economic recovery and prosperity have
          been thwarted by repeated border closures under autonomy. Poverty has
          hit hard, as unemployment rose above 50 percent.</font

          >&nbsp;Meanwhile, the initial feeling of freedom and security has
          evaporated, as tales of corruption and intimidation have spread. Many
          have concluded that the restrictions imposed by the Cairo accord are
          deeply humiliating. People observed that the agreement with Israel has
          turned Palestinian leaders into virtual captives in Gaza and Jericho,
          who could not even travel from one autonomy zone to the other. As the
          months went by they became increasingly angered by Israel’s refusal to
          free Palestinian political prisoners.</font

          as he helplessly endured Yitzhak Tabin’s insults. Damning too have
          been Arafat’s outbursts of temper, the nepotism that marked his
          appointments, his refusal to delegate even minor matters, his
          autocratic style and his controversial links with local villains
          against the advice of his own ministers. He in effect reduced his
          cabinet to mere ceremonial status by insisting that he remain the sole
          reference and arbiter of all Palestinian affairs.</font

          breakdown in the decision-making process, as the were forced to refer
          more and more of their business to Arafat himself, particularly in the
          realms of personnel matters and taxation. Gradually people were losing
          faith and hope.</font

          sympathy and support. Hamas and Islamic Jihad are part of the
          phenomenon sweeping the region following the defeat of Arab
          nationalism. Islamic militants are strengthened by the colonial nature
          of the Israeli settlement movement, spearheaded by Jewish
          fundamentalists, and by economic collapse. As the peace process has
          looked increasingly unproductive, Hamas has championed ongoing
          resistance to the Israelis and opposition to the PLO-Israeli
          agreement, now viewed as a virtual sell-out.</font

          up the process of inevitable confrontation. From the early days
          ambivalent messages were thrown about by both the sages were thrown
          about by both the PNA and Hamas. The PNA, feeling increasingly
          insecure, could not without ample cause take the decision of
          confrontation since it feared the consequences.</font

          activists, the PNA wanted to demonstrate that it had both the power
          and the will to impose its authority. It sent hundreds of police and
          security officers to the streets of Gaza as a show of force. But such
          was the insecurity of the PNA that it also banned political meetings
          and demonstrations. This act described as necessary for security
          purposes, spectacularly overlooked the psychological needs of an
          oppressed community for free expression. Suddenly, the image of the
          Palestinian policeman metamorphosed from protector to oppressor.</font

          tortured and suffered at the hands of Israelis severe forms of
          psychological damage, including the effect of identification with the
          aggressor. Once they were enjoying power they were not able to handle
          their suppressed anger, which, ironically, came out against the wrong

          teach the Islamic movement a lesson. The timing was interesting, as it
          closely followed the humiliation of Yasser Arafat at the funeral of an
          Islamic Jihad martyr. In early November Arafat was jeered and forced
          to leave the Omari Mosque in Gaza City by a crowd of Islamic Jihad
          supporters mourning for Hani Abed, who had been killed in the Gaza
          Strip by a car bomb that bore all the marks of an Israeli

          around the mosque, armed with shields and ammunition. The Islamic
          activists were also ready for a showdown, armed with posters, slogans
          and loud speakers. Some may have been armed. The confrontation was
          inevitable, but we were all stunned at the scale of the killing.

          parts of the West Bank back to Jordan, once it has been demonstrated
          that the PNA is not up to the job of self-rule. The PNA has claimed in
          an official communique that hamas was armed by a foreign power in
          order to destroy the Palestinian entity and the hope of building a
          state. Hamas declared that the PNA is a humble servant of

          enforce and election on all parties concerned. Palestinians need a
          credible leadership with which they can identify. They need to feel
          like dignified citizens able to participate in the shaping of their
          future. Only a democratically elected leadership can rule by law and
          enforce it with the power of the people. If Arafat is elected, he will
          then be mandated by the people with a power that is far more
          reassuring than that of his security apparatus. Israel should not
          object to the election and if it does, Palestinians should go ahead
