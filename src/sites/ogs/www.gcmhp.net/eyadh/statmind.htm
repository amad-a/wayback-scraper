        where the clan is the main source of security and form of identity.
        Their political organizations who have replaced the tribe did not
        further the national identity, instead they deepened the tribal
        divisions through ideological or religious polarization. Authoritarian

        years of Occupation. Paradoxical relation with the alien rulers had
