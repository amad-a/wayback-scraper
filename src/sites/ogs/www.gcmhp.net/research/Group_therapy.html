      Over the last 27 years Palestinian children have been exposed to a variety
      of traumatic events including witnessing acts of violence, beating to
      themselves or their relative, imprisonment, tear gas, and night raids (Abu
      Hein et al., 1993).
    </div>
    <div dir="LTR">
      According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
      Third Edition- Revised (DSM-III-R)(1987), diagnostic criteria for PTSD
      include (1) exposure to an extreme stressor outside the range of usual
      human experience; (2) re experiencing the traumatic event via memories,
      dreams, flashbacks, or distress at exposure to reminders; (3) persistent
      avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma, or numbing of general
      responsiveness; and (4) symptoms of increased arousal, such as sleep
      disturbance, irritability, difficulty concentrating, hyper vigilance, and
      exaggerated startle response.

    </div>
    <div dir="LTR">
      This 15- item scale was developed by Horowitz, Wilner and Alvarez (1979)
      to measure the two most characteristic aspects of post-traumatic
      psychopathology, namely the strength of unpleasant, intrusive thoughts and
      the energy spent in trying to block them out of consciousness. The
      intrusive sub-scale of the Impact of Event Scale draws upon the signs and
      symptoms of intrusive (invading, disturbing) cognition and affects. The
      avoidance sub-scale of the IES draws upon avoidance behaviour, denial or
      the blocking of thoughts and image. It is currently the most widely used
      instrument in the study of PTSD in adults. It has been used with children
      aged 8-16 years ( Yule &amp; Williams, 1990), where it was found that
      children who had survived a sea disaster found the questions meaningful
      and reported scores as high as those of traumatized adults. The ICES was
      used to screen children for PTSD ( Yule &amp; Udwin, 1990).
    </div>
    <div dir="LTR">
      The ICES was used after the gulf crisis on children in Iraq (Dyregov &amp;
      Raundalen, 1991) revealed highly disturbed population of children who were
      exceedingly bothered by intrusive thoughts of the war. This scale was
      applied on the beginning of group therapy and 2 months after starting the
      therapy.

    </div>
    <div dir="LTR">
      This is a well standardized instrument (Rutter et al, 1970). The scale
      consists of thirty-one statements concerning the child's behaviour. The
      parent is asked to indicate the frequency of occurrence of the behaviour,
      or the degree of its severity, or the extent to which the statement
      applies to the child. Each item is cored 0,1, or 2, producing a total
      score within the range of 0-62.
    </div>
    <div dir="LTR">
      The selection of children with emotional or conduct d, tow largest
      clinical diagnostic categories (Rutter, 1965), is a two-stage procedure:
    </div>
    <div dir="LTR">
      1. Children with a total score of 13 or more are designated as showing
      some disorder;
    </div>
    <p dir="LTR">
      2. Of these children, those with an emotional score exceeding the conduct
      score are designated as having 'conduct disorder". Children with equal
      emotional and conduct subscores remain undifferentiated, although recent
      studies indicate that these disorders are more like the conduct disorders
      than emotional disorders in terms of the associated impairment in
      educational attainments.
    </p>

    <p dir="LTR">
      The "emotional disorder: subscore is obtained by summing up the score of
      items B, G, V, 6 and 15("has stomach-ache or vomiting" " has tears on
      arrival at school or refused to go to the building" " does he/she have any
      sleeping difficulty?" ; " often worried, worried about many things", and
      "tends to be fearful or afraid of new things or new situations").
    </p>

    <p dir="LTR">
      The "conduct disorder" subscore is obtained by summing the scores of items
      III, 3,13, 17, and 18 (" does he/she ever steal things?"; "often destroys
      own or others" belongings"; "is often disobedient"; " often tells lies"

    <div dir="LTR">
      The first checklist was developed by the research department of the Gaza
      Community Mental Health Program (G.C.M.H.P)( Appendix). The checklist
      consisted of 17 items covering different types of traumatic events that a
      Palestinian child may have been exposed to during the occupation period
      (tear gas, beating, witnessing the beating, breaking bones, imprisonment,
      siblings imprisonment, injury, night raids, humiliation, and detention)
      (Abu Hein et al., 1993; Summerfield, 1993). This checklist is completed by
      the child himself (age 6-16 years) by "Yes" or "No". The summation of
      traumatic events is scored according to the number of the traumatic
      events. Less than 5 traumatic events are rated as "few", 5-9 events are
      rated as "frequent", and 10 or more as "much".

      Fredrick (1985) developed the Post Traumatic Stress Reaction Index to
      study the effects of trauma on children. The index is a PTSD scale
      developed from DSM-III criteria for the PTSD. This instrument designed to
      assess the degree of Posttraumatic symptomatology in children. He reported
      that 60% of disaster victims, 100% of children who had been sexually
      molested, and 70% of those who had been physically abused, fulfilled PTSD
      as defined by DSM-III (APA, 1987).
    </div>
    <div dir="LTR">
      The CPTSD-RI (Appendix) is a 20-item scale designed to assess
      post-traumatic stress reactions of school-age children and adolescents
      (6-16 years) following exposure to a broad range of traumatic events. Its
      scores by 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 according to presence of symptoms.The scale
      correlates at +0.95 with persons diagnosed in clinical settings in
      hospitals as compared to those persons diagnosed officially by mental
      health personnel as having PTSD.
    </div>
    <div dir="LTR">
      Previous published empirical comparisons of CPTSD-RI scores with a
      diagnosis of PTSD in clinical populations have suggested the following
      guidelines: a total score of 12-24 indicates a "mild" level of PTSD
      reaction; 25-39 a "moderate" level; 40-59 a "severe" level; above 60 a
      "very severe" reaction. Inter-rater reliability for this instrument when
      administered by a clinician has been reported to be excellent, with a
      Cohen kappa of 0.87 for inter-item agreement (Pynoos et al, 1987). Table
      3.3.4.1.
    </div>
    <p dir="LTR">
      The PTSDRI was standardized on 750 children and 1,350 adult cases of
      stress-laden events and has shown a correlation of .91 with a positive
      PTSD diagnosis in children (Fredrick, 1985). More recently, Shannon et al.
      (1994) and Lonigan et al. (1994) used the PTSDRI in a study with more than
      5,500 children exposed to Hurricane Hugo. Shannon al. (1994) reported huge
      internal consistency values (alpha=.83) for the full instrument and values
      ranging from .55 to.86 for symptoms clusters corresponding to DSM-II-R,
      Lonigan et al. (1994) provided validity evidence for the PTSDRI by
      demonstrating that the presence of PTSD synptomatology assessed by the
      PTSDRI was strongly related to self-reported hurricane severity, degree of
      home damage, and continued displacement. Similarly , Shaw et al. (1995)
      used the instrument in a study of children 2 months after Hurricane
      Andrew, estimated coefficient alpha at .75, and the test-retest
      reliability between 2 and 8 months posthurricane was .59.

      This scale was applied on the beginning of group therapy and 3 months
      after starting the therapy. This scale was translated to Arabic and
      validity and reliability testing was done and adapted to Arabic cultures.

      <b><font color="#000066">Conclusion:</font></b>
    </div>
    <div dir="LTR">
      Clinical impression and descriptive data from the group of traumatized
      children treated by group treated by group therapy here seen to support
      the notion that group therapy is an effective therapy in traumatized
      children to some extend and this was apparent in observing the decline in
      scoring of PTSD , avoidance and intrusion scores after three months of
      therapy.
    </div>
    <div dir="LTR">
      However ,in looking to Rutter scale there was no much difference in period
      of three months and this support other opinions that Rutter scale is the
      fact the most of those children experiences. Another reason of no change
      of Ruttter scale is the fact the most of those children were chronically
      traumatized and some of the neurotic and behaviour problems they have are
      due to the previous traumatic experiences.
    </div>
    <p dir="LTR">
      From our observation during the therapy sessions some of those children
      were obsessed with the Special Israeli Forces especially Mohammed.
    </p>

    <p dir="LTR">
      The therapy session was done in a transition period between the end of the
      Israelis occupation to Gaza strip and coming of the Palestinian police and
      it was apparent in their drawings the change from pictures full of killing
      , and blood to anther shining picture of the Palestinian colored flags and
      slogans welcoming the Palestinian police.
