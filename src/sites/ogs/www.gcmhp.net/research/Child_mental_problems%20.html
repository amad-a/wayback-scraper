      This study describes the mental health characteristics of 150 children of
      6-13 years of age, who had been referred to different types of services in
      the Gaza strip: a community mental health centre, five primary health
      centres and a paediatric hospital. There was a high rate of somatising
      disorders among children referred to the mental health centre (42%).
      Parent-reported rates of significant mental health problems were high for
      all groups, i.e. 70% in the mental health centre group, 30% in the
      paediatric group, and 18% among children referred to primary health
      centres.

      Children with mental health problems and disorders are seen by a variety
      of health services and health care professionals, often in an
      unco-ordinated way. A substantial proportion of cases are seen by
      community and hospital paediatricians, health visitors and school nurses
      (Kurtz et al, 1994; Health Advisory Service, 1995).
    </p>

    <div dir="LTR">
      Garralda &amp; Bailey found that 23% of children of 7-12 years of age
      attending general practice had psychiatric disorders, which were
      associated with family breakdown and parental stress. The same authors
      found a psychiatric prevalence of 28% among the same age group of
      referrals to general paediatrics, which was mainly accounted for by
      emotional disorders (two thirds of psychiatric disorders). The rate rose
      to 47% for reported psychological factors associated to somatic
      presentations (Garralda &amp; Bailey, 1990).
    </div>
    <div dir="LTR">
      Less is known about the rate and nature of child mental health problems
      seen in different health care settings in developing countries. In a
      two-stage study in Nigeria, Gureje et al (1994) found that 20% of children
      treated in paediatric primary care had a psychiatric disorder (6%
      depressive disorders, 4.7% anxiety-related disorders and 6.1% conduct
      disorders).

      The aims of this study were (1) to identify the mental health

      The study was completed in the Gaza strip, which had a population of
      860,369 in 1995, excluding returnees from abroad after the peace process.
      The Gaza strip has a high population density of 2,150 people per
      km<sup>2</sup>, which is a psychosocial risk factor for child
      psychopathology. The total refugee population is 62.6%. About 55.1% live
      in eight crowded camps, and 44.9% live in villages and towns. Half of the
      population (50.8%) are younger than 15 years of age. In 1995, the annual
      infant birth rate was 49.4 per 1000 population, the infant mortality rate
      was between 26-50 per 1000 infants, and the general population death rate
      was 8 per 1000. Respiratory diseases and diarrhoea are major causes of
      infant morbidity and mortality. The annual increase of population growth
      in the Gaza strip is 4.5%.

    <div dir="LTR">
      Referrals were selected from the following health care settings:
    </div>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <i>A community child mental health service</i> in Gaza. The mental
        health centre was established in 1994, together with a community mental
        health centre in the Khan Younis area. Referrals are made by other
        clinicians, schools and parents. There are two community clinics for
        both children and adults, as well as an out-patient clinic at the Gaza
        psychiatric hospital. These services are managed and clinically
        supervised by the first author.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div dir="LTR">
      b) <i>Five Primary Health Centres </i>in Gaza and Rafah city. These
      primary health care settings are usually drop-in centres, without a
      referral procedure. In total, there are 31 primary health care centres
      distributed in the five districts of the Gaza strip, 10 of which operate a
      24-hour service. The United Nations run similar clinics in the refugee
      camps in the Gaza strip. The majority of cases are seen by general
      practitioners, and there are weekly specialist clinics.
    </div>
    <div dir="LTR">&nbsp;</div>
    <div dir="LTR">
      c) <i>A Paediatric Hospital</i> (Gaza El Naser - outpatient and inpatient
      departments). This is the only paediatric hospital in the Gaza strip,
      although there is one paediatric department at the Khan Younis General
      Hospital. The hospital has 240 beds, and accepts emergencies and routine
      out-patient referrals from the primary health centres.
    </div>
    <div dir="LTR">
      Fifty consecutively referred children of 6-13 years were selected from
      each health care setting, excluding established cases of moderate to
      severe learning disability. Data were collected on family and
      socioeconomic status, and primary reason for referral. In addition,
      parents completed the <i>Rutter Scales</i> for their child (form A2,
      Arabic version). The Rutter<i> </i>Scales (Rutter et al, 1970) have been
      standardised and widely used as a measure of behavioural and emotional
      problems in epidemiological research. The scales consist of 31 items
      rating behavioural and emotional problems on a 0-2 scale. Children with a
      total score of 13 or more have been found to be potential ?cases?, i.e.
      presenting with a possible mental health disorder. Scores are also
      provided for the hyperactivity, conduct and neurotic subscales.

    </div>
    <div dir="LTR">
      Out of the 150 children, 88 were male (59%) and 62 female (41%). The mean
      age was 8.9 years (range 6-13). The majority of families (N=121, or 80.7%)
      had at least four children. Large families (with at least four children)
      were more likely to be referred to the mental health service
      (x<sup>2</sup>=7.8, DF=2, p=0.02), which is consistent with previous
      findings that family overcrowding is a risk factor for child
      psychopathology. Forty two fathers (28%) were unemployed or unskilled
      workers, and four fathers (2.7%) had a criminal record. Eleven mothers
      (7.3%) had established psychiatric illness, these were evenly distributed
      among the three groups (x<sup>2</sup>=4.2, DF=2, p=0.12).
    </div>
    <div dir="LTR">
      The psychiatric diagnoses as made by the clinician according to ICD-10
      criteria (World Health Organisation, 1992) are presented in Table 1. Only
      two children seen at the paediatric hospital received a psychiatric
      diagnosis (conversion/hysteria) and none of those referred to a primary
      health centre. However, when presence of possible disorder was established
      by scores on the Rutter scales, prevalence rates were high among all
      groups. The rates of children whose total mental health care score
      indicated a disorder were: 70% of referrals to the mental health centre,
      30% of referrals to the paediatric hospital, and 18% of children seen in
      primary health care (x<sup>2</sup>=32.9, DF=2, p&lt;0.0005 - Table 2).

      This study described the mental health characteristics of children
      referred to primary health, paediatric and psychiatric services in the
      Gaza strip. This is a heavily populated area and the child population
      carries several risk factors of developing psychiatric disorders,
      particularly the exposure to war trauma. Most health care services have
      been developed in the last few years, are well co-ordinated and accessible
      to children and families. Although the general health problems have not
      been described in this paper, the primary reasons for referral appeared
      appropriate both for general practice and hospital paediatrics.

      The findings on child mental health problems highlight two interesting
      patterns. Firstly, children referred for general health problems had
      significant psychiatric morbidity of between 18-30% according to parental
      reports. This is similar to findings from studies in general practice and
      paediatric services in western societies, and indicates the need for
      liaison and consultation work by child and adolescent psychiatrists to
      other child health care professionals. Also, the need for incorporation of
      child psychiatry teaching in undergraduate and postgraduate curriculums,
      particularly in new universities and medical schools.

      The nature and presentation of child mental healproblems ispossibly
      related to cultural factors. Many children seen at the mental health
      centre (N=21 or 42%) primarily had some

      form of somatic presentation (particularly enuresis, which often underlies
      emotional and behavioural problems). In this group, it is important to
      establish the links between physical presentation, developmental delay and
      mental health symptoms (Garralda, 1996). Only three children had a primary
      clinical diagnosis of emotional disorder. The authors have recently
      reported on other samples of children and adolescents from the general
      population of the Gaza strip who, on more detailed investigation, were
      found to present with high rates of anxiety and post-traumatic stress
      disorders (Thabet &amp; Vostanis, submitted for publication). As these
      services evolve, it is anticipated that emotional problems and disorders
      will be increasingly recognised, always in the cultural context of this
      society. For this reason, it would very interesting to repeat this study
      at a later stage.
