            >The relations between traumatic events, perceived parenting styles,
            children’s resources, political activity, and psychological
            adjustment were examined among 108 Palestinian boys and girls of
            11-12 years of age. The results showed that exposure to traumatic
            events increased psychological adjustment problems directly and via
            2 mediating paths. First, the more traumatic events children had
            experienced , the more negative parenting the experienced. And the
            poorer they perceived parenting, the more they suffered from high
            neuroticism and low self-esteem. Second the more traumatic events
            children had experienced the more political activity they showed and
            the more active they were , the more they suffered from
            psychological adjustment problems.</font

            >Good perceived parenting protected children’s psychological
            adjustment by making them less vulnerable in two ways. First
            traumatic events decreased their intellectual , creative and
            cognitive resources, and a lack of resources predicted many
            psychological adjustment problems in a model excluding perceived
            parenting second political activity increased psychological
            adjustment problems in the same model, but not in the model
            including parenting.</font
