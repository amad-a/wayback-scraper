        >The Postgraduate Diploma In Community Mental Health is a two-year
        course that is jointly run by the Islamic University of Gaza and Gaza
        Community Mental Health Programme. Candidates who successfully complete
        the course will be awarded a Diploma in Applied Community Mental Health.
        It combines both theory and clinical aspects of community mental health
        and provides candidates with a broad knowledge base. The curriculum is
        culturally sensitive, community oriented, and critically analyzes the
        concepts of human rights and mental health. Seven International
        Universities are contributing to the diploma:
        <b
          >Edinburgh University-UK, Flinders University-Australia, Oslo
          University-Norway, University of California at San Francisco-USA, Tel
          Aviv University-Israel, Tunis University-Tunisia, Utrecht

          >It is designed to encourage the candidates to explore theoretical
          concepts in community mental health and human rights in addition to
          their practical applications. Wide exposure to clinical experience
          enables them to discover their particular interest in mental health,
          while learning about different areas and how to integrate them in
          clinical practice and research.</font

            >&nbsp;It is an attempt to break away from the medical model and its
            tendency to focus on microscopic aspects of mental health. Instead,
            it hopes to place the study of mental health within the wider
            social, political, environmental and biological context. The course
            further seeks ways to shift psychiatric therapy away from
            traditional Freudian concentration on the individual and his
            unconscious motivational conflicts to move closer towards an
            emphasis on the social interpersonal care and the role of a person’s
            environment.</font

          community-based approach that emphasizes the shift from segregated and
          self-contained mental health care systems within institutions to
          community-based therapy and community involvement in health related
          issues. It also emphasizes the change in the role of mental health
          professionals from being providers of mental health care to
          facilitators of care; thus enabling individuals to solve their
          problems using the resources of the family and community institutions
          such as schools, mosques, etc.</font

          rights and to highlight the links between these concepts.</font

        consideration to local cultural problems. The curriculum is based on the
