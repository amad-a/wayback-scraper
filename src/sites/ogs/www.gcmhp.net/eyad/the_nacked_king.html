    <p>
      I greeted him and stood in the passengers’ line with him.&nbsp; We talked
      about flights and airports until it was my turn for the security
      inspection.&nbsp; Out of habit, I had a book to read until they were done
      searching my luggage.&nbsp; However, I was surprised that the check was
      relatively easy this time.&nbsp; I looked over to the man I had
      greeted.&nbsp; They had taken him aside and were questioning him and going
      through his belongings.&nbsp; An hour later, I boarded the plane and
      searched for him.&nbsp; I asked the person beside him to switch seats with
      me, and we did.&nbsp; I wanted to know what they had done to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      As soon as the plane took off, my friend started on a tirade of curses
      towards the Israeli authorities and the whole system; he angrily said,
      “Did you see how scared they got when they saw me speaking to a
      Palestinian like you?”&nbsp; I replied asking, “Aren’t you a Palestinian
      yourself?”&nbsp; He sharply replied, “No!&nbsp; I am an Israeli of Arab
      origin.&nbsp; I was born in Iraq.&nbsp; My family immigrated to Israel;
      and my father died full of sorrow, wishing he could go back to Baghdad.”
    </p>

    <p>
      He was quiet, and I was trying to absorb what he said.&nbsp; I had thought
      he was a Palestinian.&nbsp; But he was a Jewish Israeli who got into
      trouble just for speaking to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Trying to soothe him, I offered my apologies for greeting him at the
      airport.&nbsp; He exploded saying, “They are racists…Today, they are
      treating you just like they used to treat us, Sephardic Jews, as if we
      were stray dogs.&nbsp; They tricked my father and other Iraqi Jews.&nbsp;
      They promised them ‘paradise’.&nbsp; Then they blew up Jewish property in
      Baghdad so that everyone would run away to ‘the promised land’.&nbsp; We
      lived a deprived childhood.&nbsp; My father suffered from depression and
      was frustrated over losing his home, friends and a prosperous trade.&nbsp;
      He refused to learn Hebrew and died without learning a single letter of
      it.&nbsp; If it were not for our perseverance, my brothers and I would
      have never made it in this Ashkenazi-controlled Jewish society.”
    </p>

    <p>
      He was quiet again; and it seemed that he was relieved to have vented his
      anger.&nbsp; He dozed off and left me wondering as to how Ashkenazi Jews
      will ever be able to live in peace with us if they are discriminating
      against their fellow Jews.&nbsp; I remembered what they did to the Druze
      and the Palestinians who decided not to flee their towns and
      villages.&nbsp; I am convinced that true peace will not be achieved until
      the day comes when Jews are able to see Palestinians and Arabs as human
      beings.&nbsp; They must overcome their persecution complex by resolving
      the guilt of what they have done to the Palestinians.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was in a state of deep thought.&nbsp; He woke up and asked, as if
      reading my mind, “Do you think they are serious in signing a deal with
      Arafat?”&nbsp; Without waiting for an answer, he replied, “Sharon does not
      even want to shake Arafat’s hand.&nbsp; They are racists, and all they
      want is the land.”
    </p>

    <p>
      I pictured Sharon and Netanyahu, the new King of Israel, walking the earth
      as if saying, “I am king of the hill.”
    </p>

    <p>
      I felt sorry for our negotiators; and I feared for them, for us, facing
      American pressure from a President hoping that the peace process will
      rescue him from his scandals and opposition.&nbsp; I also feared the
      pressure from the Israeli king, whose only concern is preserving his
      throne, while mastering the game with the slogans of security, fighting
      terrorism, and protecting the interests of the Jewish people.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without a doubt, Arafat was successful in breaking the deadlock by
      threatening to declare a Palestinian State.&nbsp; He forced the king of
      Israel to sit down.&nbsp; He stripped him of his excuses, exposing him
      naked and vulnerable in front of Clinton and the whole world.
    </p>

    <p>
      My friend echoed some of my thoughts saying, “You are still at the
      beginning of your journey.&nbsp; You should be patient.&nbsp; Take
      everything they give you.&nbsp; Then ask for more; today you get 13%, and
      another 13 or more tomorrow.&nbsp; Today, you open an airport; tomorrow
      you will open a seaport.&nbsp; You should learn from Sephardic Jews; they
      have a long experience.”
    </p>

    <p>
      The plane landed, and my friend said goodbye with an “oriental” hug.&nbsp;
      We promised to meet in the future and he left me deep in thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Wye plantation negotiations confirmed to the world that peace is the
      overall strategy of the Palestinians.&nbsp; The Palestinian Authority
      agreed to all of Netanyahu’s conditions in order to strip him of his last
      excuse.&nbsp; The Authority put up with Sharon’s rudeness.&nbsp; They got
      what little they could and put their eyes and hopes on the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Palestinian Authority committed itself to Israeli security with
      American supervision.&nbsp; Consequently, will Palestinians finally get
      peace and freedom?&nbsp; Will the Palestinian Authority open a new page of
      democracy-building based on the rule of law, not oppression; on equality,
      not connections and nepotism; on accountability and fighting abuse of
      power?
    </p>

    <p>
      These are our questions.&nbsp; My Sephardic Jewish Israeli friend from
      Baghdad cannot answer them.&nbsp; The answers should be Palestinian.
