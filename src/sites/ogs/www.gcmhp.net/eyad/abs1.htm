        between traumatic events, children's gender and political activity, and
        parenting styles were examined among 108 Palestinians of 11 - 12 years
        of age. The results showed that the more the children were exposed to
        traumatic events, the more they perceived both their parents as strictly
        disciplining, rejecting, and hostile, and their mothers as more
        negatively evaluating. The boys perceived both their parents as treating
        them more negatively than the girls did. Affectionate parenting, such as
        intimacy and love, for its part, was not associated with traumatic
        events, and did not vary according to the child's gender or political
        activity. The gender of the child affected the association between
        traumatic events, political activity, and perceived parenting. Traumatic
        events increased perceived parental rejection and hostility only among
        the boys, and perceived strict disciplining only among the girls.
        Although politically active children perceived both of their parents as
        more negative in general, in the families exposed to a high level of
        traumatic events, passive boys perceived their fathers as more rejecting
        and hostile than active boys did. It is suggested that mothers and
        fathers rear girls restrictively and with greater attention, and boys
        with rejection, when the family faces traumatic events. In exposed
        families, fathers also tend to discourage boys' political passivity and
        apparently encourage activity.</font
