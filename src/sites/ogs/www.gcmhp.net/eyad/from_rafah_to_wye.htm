    I am fond of Egypt and its people.&nbsp; I love the crowded and noisy Cairo,
    the pedestrians dancing their way between cars, the rush in Khan El-Khalili,
    the smell of sheesha and tea on the sidewalks, and the sight of people
    passing by.&nbsp; Cairo is theatre, cinema, and millions of books.&nbsp; In
    Egypt, I feel the glory, and find the Egyptian people great in their
    humbleness and simplicity, like the sphinx, serene and firm on the ground as
    the caravan of war, peace or turmoil passes by.
    <p>
      Now it was time to leave; and we said goodbye, leaving behind a piece of
      our hearts enjoying the warmth of the morning sun.&nbsp; We got in the car
      and reached Ismailiya, full of mosquitoes.&nbsp; We crossed the Suez Canal
      and remembered the exciting Nasser's time when he took over the
      canal.&nbsp; We remembered the victory of the great Egyptian army as it
      burst through the "Bar-lev Line" for freedom and hope.&nbsp; We crossed
      the Sinai desert, suddenly full of construction and building.&nbsp; We
      finally reached the Rafah border crossing, and our agony started.&nbsp;
      Although, the journey from Cairo to Rafah was longer, the Rafah crossing
      was more exhausting and nerve wrecking.
    </p>

    <p>
      The occupation was there with its symbols, arrogance, and ugly face that
      hides behind a one way mirror or occasionally appears filled with looks of
      provocation and defiance of human dignity.&nbsp; Orders are dictated and
      given to us by a Palestinian policeman, who feels the humiliation and
      frustration like us.&nbsp; The person in charge orders me to take off my
      glasses and go through the security gate that keeps beeping every time I
      pass.&nbsp; She orders me to empty my pocket, take off my belt, and
      finally take off the shoes, which I felt like striking at the earth and on
      all those that speak about peace.
    </p>

    <p>
      Is this the crossing point to the liberated land?&nbsp; Nonetheless, it is
      still much easier than exiting through Erez "Beit Hanoun" checkpoint,
      where a series of cages and groups of soldiers enjoying the look of
      helplessness and need in people's faces wait for the traveler.
    </p>

    <p>
      We hear the voice in the radio saying that Palestinian officials are
      cautiously optimistic about reaching an agreement with the Israelis in
      Washington.&nbsp; Al Quds newspaper proclaims that a Security Agreement
      was reached as a prelude to the conclusion of the "Wye Plantation" summit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, I am sure that the sides will reach an agreement, especially that
      Sharon is there.&nbsp; He is a man of his word, what the US wants after
      Netanyahu baffled the world with his words and promises!&nbsp; They will
      agree to withdraw from more land, to create a natural reserve, to lay out
      the security arrangements for the opening and functioning of the Gaza
      airport, to discuss the safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank, and
      to release some prisoners from Israeli jails.&nbsp; All this gives room
      for joy and hope in the future.&nbsp; However, the question still
      persists, "Will the occupation be ended? Or will a new piece of land be
      put under the Palestinian administration while maintaining Israeli control
      over borders, stranglehold on people's lives, settlement building and
      expansion, and withdrawal of ID cards?"
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a joy to see the Palestinian flag raised over Palestinian
      land.&nbsp; However, will that only create a new class of VIPs that look
      down with disdain on the long lines of laborers trying to get permits to
      pass and permits to live?&nbsp; We are overjoyed by the return of every
      bit of Palestinian land, and by the paving of a new street or even
      sidewalk.&nbsp; Yet, true joy will not be felt until the last
      manifestations and remains of the occupation are removed, injustice and
      oppression abolished, prisoners released, Palestinian IDs are printed in
      Arabic, with smiling pictures, and stamped with the seal of freedom.
