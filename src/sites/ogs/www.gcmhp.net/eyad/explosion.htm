        put forth his thoughts on the demise of the peace process in a long
        article published on 31 March 1998 in Al-Quds newspaper. He laid the
        blame for the failure of the peace process on the Israeli Government and
        American bias. He ended the article attempting to answer the
        long-standing question of “What to do?” by pointing out the Palestinian
        strategies on the local, Arab, and international arenas. I do not think
        that many would differ with what Dr. Abdel Shafi wrote. If the question
        of what to do was easy to answer, the question of how to do it
        remains.</font

        Palestinian Authority’s failures are evident through the prevalent chaos
        and violations, the lack of accountability, the absence of good role
        models, and oppression of freedom of speech. Dr. Abdel Shafi did not
        mention the deep disappointment and frustration spread among us like a
        famine, and the nostalgic and vengeful thoughts occupying people’s minds
        as a result of the splitting of society into “the rich and powerful new

        parties, some of which have evaporated or are idle, with a portion of
        their leadership languishing behind Palestinian bars. Also, what of the

        The responsibility for that is a collective Palestinian one that
        requires intellectuals and politicians to start a serious and effective
        dialogue. However, the historical problem remains; are people prepared
        to cross the barrier of fear, and are the regimes ready to accept
        freedom of speech and opinions? We do not doubt the near impossibility
        of this, which will hasten the confrontation between the democratic
        forces and the governments.</font

        >The Palestinian dilemma and Palestinian rights have been abused by the
        ruling regimes to rise to power and preserve their stranglehold of the
        people in league with the colonial powers, whose sole concern is the
        preservation of the status quo regardless of democracy and human rights.
        While these regimes try to occupy the people with television shows and
        opening new free trade zones, free thinkers lie in prisons.</font

        >The Zionist conspiracy on Palestine in alliance with the Anglo-Saxon
        league of the USA and Britain is powerful in its control of world media
        and manipulation of voters. In addition, it influences the European
        economy and uses the guilt complex of the holocaust and the fear of
        being labeled “anti-Semite”. Although we rightfully blame the United
        States and Britain for the catastrophes that befell the Palestinian
        people from the uprooting in ’48 till Oslo, we still insist that the
        main responsibility to change remains ours. We only need to look at the
        South African example of how the forces of freedom and democracy
        remained faithful to their principles, and eventually forced their will
        on the imperial and racist powers. They recruited world opinion and
        forced governments to boycott apartheid in South Africa until the regime
        crumbled, and Mandela marched from his prison cell to the presidential
        palace in triumph.</font

        threatening internal violence and against Israel, as pain and anger have
        saturated the atmosphere. Netanyahu will understand that he was gambling
        with the lives of Jews when he was trying to strangle the Palestinian
        people into submission, humiliate them, and draw relief from their
        suffering. The Palestinian Authority will understand, and maybe when it
        is too late, that we were all hostages in the name of peace.</font
