        >When established in 1990, the primary staff at the Gaza Community
        Mental Health Programme (GCMHP) recognized the absence of training
        institutes that could adequately prepare mental health professionals in
        Gaza. To overcome this problem, the Programme embarked on ambitious
        <b><a href="#in">in-service training activities</a></b> for the staff at
        GCMHP and attracted trainers from prestigious training institutes from
        around the world. The trainers provided in-house training to the GCMHP
        staff so as to enable them to offer quality services to the Palestinian
        population. Several selected members of the staff went abroad to further
        their professional skills and returned with an increased capacity to
        assist in the training of local staff. The capacity of the Palestinian
        staff to conduct their own culturally sensitive training has also
        increased. In 1995, a<b> one-year training of trainer’s course</b> was
        conducted for five mental health professionals from GCMHP. The course
        aimed to improve the local trainers' training skills, enabling them to
        properly train others.</font

        >In addition to training GCMHP staff, the Programme has increasingly
        been called upon to train other Palestinian health care providers in
        various mental health skills. For example, in 1993 the Programme
        successfully completed a
        <b
          ><a href="#nurse"
            >three-month comprehensive course in community mental health
            nursing</a
          >.</b
        >
        Twelve nurses from the Palestinian Health System attended the course. In
        1994, the department conducted a
        <b><a href="#one">one-year course in community mental health</a></b
        >. Twelve social workers, psychologists, nurses, and doctors from
        different governmental and non-governmental organizations completed the
        course. These promising results encouraged the training Department to
        organize another course in 1995 for another fifteen professionals. Upon
        the completion of the course, the Palestinian Ministry of Education
        employed all students as mental health professionals in health
        institutions and as school counselors. In 1996, the department
        organized<b> a</b>
        <b>six month training course for a women community leader </b>for twelve
        community women leaders completed the course. Currently, they are
        running their own community women center in the southern part of Gaza.
        Twelve more students participated another one-year
        <b>women community leaders course</b>. The graduates opened their own
        community women center in Beach Camp in Gaza City.</font

        for mental health workers of any discipline in an attempt to address

        in Palestine. Training aimed to ensure that candidates have adequate
        knowledge of state of the art theories, principles, and treatment and
        prevention strategies used in addressing mental health concerns. The
        training is based on a spirit of the candidate’s active participation
