        third international conference held its second day of activities today
        in the Rashad El-Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City, Palestine. The
        theme of this year's October 13-15 conference is Health and Human
        Rights. The conference brings together over 400 health professionals
        scholars, and social activists from throughout the world to discuss the
        still-grim situation faced by Palestinians in the occupied territories
        and Palestinian semi-autonomous territory. The morning Plenary Session
        was marred by the absence of&nbsp; <b>Dr. Mustafa El-Barghouthi </b>of
        the Union of Palestinian Medical Relief Committees. He was prevented by
        the Israeli authorities from traveling from his office in Beit Hanina to
        the conference in Gaza
        <a href="/web/19990203055204/http://www.gcmhp.net/fstory.htm">(</a

        Such absences are beginning to harm the integrity of an otherwise very
        successful conference. The Gaza Community Mental Health Programme
        (GCMHP) and conference participants condemn the intransigence of Israeli
        authorities involved in this matter. Freedom of travel is a basic human
        right that is being withdrawn by the Israeli authorities on a variety of
        pretexts.</font

    <p>
      <font color="#000066"
        >In the Plenary Session, <b>Professor Bent Sorensen</b>, Vice-Chairman
        of the UN Committee against Torture, presented a paper on
        <i>The UN Convention against Torture and the Case of Israel</i>. In a
        scathing indictment of the ongoing Israeli policy of torture, Professor
        Sorensen detailed Israeli violations of the UN Convention against
        Torture. The Convention, according to Sorensen, clearly states that
        torture is not allowed; there can be no excuse for it whatsoever, and
        the act is not excusable even if one is under orders. Sorensen denounced
        the January 1994 Landau Commission report, which allowed the use of
        moderate physical pressure against detainees. He declared that the UN
        Committee against Torture considers the Landau Commission reports to be
        completely unacceptable and recommends that the secret torture
        procedures it outlines be published in full. Sorensen stated that the
        Committee expected to find torture in Israel during its investigations
        in 1994 and had proved its concerns by 1997. One clear example of
        torture in Israel is severe shaking. The Israelis mislabel this as the
        use of moderate physical pressure. Sorensen expressed his disappointment
        that Israel has recently stated that it will not be ready for a November
        meeting to discuss torture and the necessity of releasing the Landau
        Commission report in full.</font

      <font color="#000066"
        ><b>Dr. Adriaan Van Es</b> of the Johannes Wier Foundation delivered a
        speech entitled
        <i>UN Special Rapporteurs on Health Professionals and Human Rights</i>.
        In introductory remarks, Van Es gave his full support to the newly
        registered Physicians for Human Rights branch in East Jerusalem. He then
        said that, because of the unique access they have during times of
        political conflict or tension, health professionals are sometimes the
        only ones with detailed knowledge of human rights violations. This
        access necessitates proper reporting mechanisms. Dr. Van Es expressed
        the concern that the duty to report human rights violations often
        conflicts with the desires of violators to suppress such information.
        Health professionals risk a great deal in reporting such violations, but
        there is a real need to be wary of professional apathy and
        self-censorship. As a result, health professionals need legal protection
        and strong organizational backing. A UN rapporteur could help meet the
        need of health professionals for protection, but such a position should
        not be allowed to overlap with already existing UN jobs. Rather, the
        position should have integrative capacities. This rapporteur would
        receive, evaluate, investigate, and report allegations of threats
        directed at health professionals.</font

      <font color="#000066"
        ><b>Dr. Rami Heilbronn</b> of the Medical Foundation for the Care of
        Victims of Torture spoke powerfully and movingly during a speech
        entitled Bystanding and Whistle-blowing. He began his presentation by
        condemning the Israelis for not permitting the attendance of Dr.
        Barghouthi and by criticizing the Palestinian Authority for its
        continuing incarceration of Fathi Suboh (whose wife was present at
        today's conference). He then moved from the general to the specific in
        discussing the fragmentation of Jewish identity over the past 100 years.
        Israel, he declared, is an ethnocentric Jewish national state
        established to solve the persecution of Jews in Europe and cultural
        problems pertaining to secular Jewish identity. It solved neither; and
        in fact, according to Heilbronn, Israel is now the most dangerous place
        in the world for Jews as it fails to promote a secular Jewish identity.
        Furthermore, the suffering caused by Israel to Palestinians has not been
        accidental but is an inevitable outcome of Jewish ethnocentrism. In a
        moving tribute to Mordechai Vanunu, Heilbronn stated that Vanunu moved
        beyond his ethnocentric perspective and into an anthropocentric identity
        and consciousness when he blew the whistle on the secrets of the Dimona
        nuclear facility in Israel. He paid for his bravery when the Mossad
        apprehended him in Rome. He was charged with treason and aggravated
        espionage in a secret trial held in 1986. His prison term is for 18
        years. According to Heilbronn, Mordechai's new anthropocentric identity
        results in Vanunu belonging to the human race and not a more limited
        individual identity. He has transcended loyalty to an ethnic group to a
        loyalty to humankind. The bridges between Vanunu's cause and other
        groups became clear when Heilbronn showed a recent photograph of
        Palestinian women holding pictures of both Vanunu and an imprisoned
        relative. Both men were being held in Ashkelon prison. Heilbronn urged
        the release of all political prisoners.</font

      <font color="#000066"
        >Three concurrent workshops were held in the morning. Participants in
        workshop one discussed Mental Health and Human Rights.
        <b>Professor James Graff</b> of the University of Toronto presented his
        paper on <i>Mental Health and Respect for Human Rights</i>. Professor
        Graff declared that basic elements involved in supporting human rights
        involve community support and the maintenance of strong family
        relations. <b>The Rev. Dr. John R. Van Eenwyk</b> of the University of
        Washington Medical School delivered a presentation on
        <i>The Psychology of Oppression</i>. Dr. Van Eenwyk stated that
        oppression causes people to seek safety behind the brutality those
        members of their own group employ in the name of keeping them safe. This
        creates a trauma cycle wherein people seek to protect themselves by
        traumatizing others, who then respond in the same manner. Only when
        oppressed people of all groups realize they have more in common with
        each other than with members of their own groups can the cycle be
        broken. <b>Dr. Mohamed Mandour</b> of the Palestine Red Crescent Society
        spoke on<i>
          Mental Peace of Palestinians and their Lack of Fundamental Human
          Rights</i
        >. He stated that Palestinians had nothing to do with the suffering
        caused to the Jewish people before the creation of Israel and so it is
        unfair for them to pay the price now. There is an urgent need to support
        and protect Palestinian human rights in order to alleviate the suffering
        imposed by Israel both before and after the peace process.</font
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <font color="#000066"
        >The second morning workshop dealt with Violations of Women's Rights.
        <b>Ms. Zeinab El-Ghoneimi </b>of the Ministry of Labor in the PA
        discussed
        <i>The Consequences of Ignoring Palestinian Working Women's Rights</i>.
        Ms. El-Ghoneimi stated that current law does not effectively protect
        working women, but there is an effort in the Palestinian Legislative
        Council to protect working women and their rights by providing maternal
        leave, sick leave, and time each day for breast-feeding.
        <b>Dr. Muhammad M. Haj-Yahia </b>of The Hebrew University delivered a
        presentation on
        <i
          >Wife Abuse and Battering in Palestinian society: The Incidence of the
          Problem, Some of its Mental Health and Marital Consequences, and
          Women's Strategies of Coping</i
        >. He stated that it is difficult in some instances to even gather
        information on the situation faced by women in Palestine because the
        husbands of some women prevent them from replying to questionnaires. His
        research study indicated that 40-50 percent of Palestinian women are
        punished either physically or psychologically by their husbands.
        <b>Ms. Tonia Govender </b>of The National Institute for Crime Prevention
        and Rehabilitation of Offenders - Durham Office spoke on
        <i>Abused Women: The Way Forward</i>. She stated that under the former
        South African government, women were raped by members of the police
        forces. Women were also tortured. Police forces are currently reluctant
        to involve themselves in cases of domestic abuse.</font
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <font color="#000066"
        >The morning's third workshop was on Rehabilitating Survivors of Human
        Rights Violations. <b>Dr. Binnie Kristal-Andersson</b>, a clinical
        psychologist and psychotherapist from Sweden, presented a paper on
        <i
          >Human Rights and Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Supervision/Training of
          The Gaza Community Mental Health Programme's Staff members - A Focus
          on the Former Political Prisoners</i
        >. She posited that many of the GCMHP staff had been imprisoned and
        abused by the Israelis. She then raised the question of how such
        traumatic experiences affected their work. She then stated that the
        GCMHP staff's experience as political prisoners deepened their
        understanding of commitment, taught them teamwork and cohesion skills,
        and gave them an acute awareness of their own capabilities and limits.
        <b>Mr. Ahmad Abu Tawahina </b>of the GCMHP then delivered a paper
        entitled
        <i
          >The Social Network of Support as a Focus of Trauma and Treatment in
          Torture Victims: The Palestinian Experience</i
        >, in which he stressed the importance of networks of support to
        rehabilitation efforts. Religion, the family, and professional and
        community networks are central to a torture victim's rehabilitation. It
        was such networks which the Israelis targeted and sought to destroy.
        <b>Dr. Satia Advan</b> of The Human Rights Foundation of Turkey -
        Istanbul Office then followed with a description of Turkish torture
        practices in her paper, <i>An Evaluation of 182 Torture Survivors</i>.
        As in Palestine, Advan argued that a mechanism of systematic torture
        aimed at political opposition existed in Turkey.
        <b>Professor Federico Allodi and Dr. Sameh Hassan</b>, two Canadian
        psychiatrists, rounded off the workshop with a discussion of how Western
        models of psychotherapy could be applied to Arab patients. In their
        paper, entitled
        <i
          >Western Psychotherapy with Arab and Islamic Patients: A
          Cross-Cultural Model</i
        >, Hassan and Allodi argued that, first, Arab patients are receptive to
        Western methods and theory, and that, second, one need only adapt such
        methods to the native environment. They described the therapist as a
        stage director in charge of organizing the patient's narrative into a
        history compatible with Western therapeutic methods.</font
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <font color="#000066"
        >Six workshops were held in the afternoon on a variety of subjects. The
        first workshop covered Mental Health and Human Rights.
        <b>Dr. Moshe Landsman</b> of Israeli Mental Health Workers for the
        Advancement of Peace (IMUT) delivered a paper entitled,
        <i>Rights from Within: The Phenomenology of Health and Empowerment</i>.
        He detailed the prison experience of ex-prisoner Emad Saba' through the
        use of Amedeo Giorgi's four basic criteria of analysis of human
        experience: meaning attribution, sociality, historicity, and
        expressiveness. <b>Ms. Fiona McKay</b> of Redress delivered a paper on
        <i>Reparation for Torture in National Legal Systems</i>. She insisted
        that there should be financial compensation to those people exposed to
        torture. <b>Dr. Nuray Karali</b> of The Human Rights Foundation of
        Turkey - Istanbul Office spoke on
        <i>Forced Migration, Torture, and Related Psychological Problems</i>.
        Dr. Karali cited her research study on immigrants, stating that many
        suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, anxiety, depression, and
        loss of hope. <b>Professor Aliki Coudroglou</b> of Arizona State
        University spoke on
        <i>Human Rights, Mental Health, and Human Welfare</i>. Coudroglou stated
        that culture plays an important role in affecting human rights and human
        welfare.</font
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <font color="#000066"
        >The second afternoon workshop was on The Violation of Children's
        Rights. <b>Ms. Anja Meulenbelt</b>, a mental health trainer, gave a talk
        entitled <i>Domestic Violence in the Context of Political Turmoil</i>.
        Her first point was that as the level of political violence rises, so
        does the level of domestic violence. Aggression, she said, which during
        times of political turmoil was channeled outward toward a common enemy,
        is now turned inward. <b>Dr. Jomanah Odeh</b> of the Palestinian Happy
        Child Center delivered a speech on
        <i>Children with Special Needs: Their Rights and Future</i>. She sounded
        what became a main theme in the workshop, that "the Palestinian child
        cannot attain the international standards of health until the
        Palestinian people are liberated from continuing occupation." The point
        was made, however, that this fact in no way excuses the Palestinian
        people of their own responsibility toward their children.
        <b>Dr. Fadel Abu Hein</b> of the Gaza College of Education delivered a
        presentation on <i>Palestinian Children under Political Suffocation</i>.
        He discussed how a new social class is emerging: working children. The
        closures imposed by the Israelis have had a devastating effect on the
        Palestinian working class. Children have consequently been enlisted to
        work long hours under dangerous conditions. Despite the difficulty of
        effecting change under continued occupation, the solution is partly the
        responsibility of the Palestinian people.</font
      >

    <p>
      <font color="#000066"
        >The third afternoon conference was on Public Education Strategies.
        <b>Ms. Sibongile Ngobese</b> of the Rape Crisis Community Outreach
        Project delivered a presentation on
        <i
          >Developing Partnerships with the Police: A Strategy for Public
          Education in South Africa</i
        >. She stated that there has been a recent, small improvement in police
        respect for the human rights of the people in South Africa. There is now
        a better relationship between the police and the public. Furthermore,
        NGOs are working to improve police awareness of the importance of human
        rights. <b>Ms. Beryl Cheal</b> of Portland State University spoke on
        <i
          >Helping Young Children Cope with the Trauma of Violence: Strategies
          for Schools</i
        >. She stated that therapy is vital for children who have endured
        traumatic experiences and that schools have a crucial role to play in
        helping develop healthy children. <b>Ms. Maureen Kushner </b>of The
        Kids' Comedy Club spoke on
        <i
          >Peace Through Humor: Laughter is the Shortest Distance Between Two
          People</i
        >. She stated that children can be helped a great deal by getting them
        to laugh, dance, and enjoy themselves through comedy. A comedy club can
        help provide children with knowledge of the world's problems, but in an
        environment in which they can still enjoy themselves.</font
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <font color="#000066"
        >The fourth afternoon workshop was on Preventing Torture.
        <b>Professor Richard Garfield</b> of Columbia University delivered a
        speech on <i>The Impact of Economic Embargoes on Human Rights</i>. He
        stated that mortality, infectious disease, and general health have all
        deteriorated in Iraq due to the deleterious effects of the embargo.
        <b>Dr. Umit Bicer</b> of Kocaeli University spoke on
        <i>Human Rights Education</i>. He asserted that physicians participate
        in torture by practicing medical exams on people without their consent,
        by not reporting instances of torture, by providing medical knowledge to
        torturers, by providing medical assistance without denouncing torture
        and simultaneously tendering their resignations, and by preparing false
        health certificates and/or autopsy reports.
        <b>Professor Joop de Jong</b> of the Free University of Amsterdam and
        TPO - Amsterdam delivered a presentation on
        <i
          >The Program of the Transcultural Psychosocial organization (TPO) on
          the Psychosocial Consequences of Man-made Disaster in Eight African
          and Asian Countries</i
        >. He stressed the importance of developing sound coping strategies for
        those traumatized by war. Administrators, social workers, and
        psychologists should work together in order to help the traumatized to
        cope with their experiences. <b>Ms. Anne-Laurence Lacroix</b>, in a talk
        entitled, <i>Preventing Torture</i>, stated that human rights NGOs need
        to redouble their efforts in pressuring governments to cease the
        practice of torture. International pressure, particularly in the form of
        the UN, should continue to be utilized to urge an end to torture.</font
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <font color="#000066"
        ><b>Mr. Michael Adams</b> of the Palestinian Studies Trust began the
        fifth workshop, The Media and Human Rights, with a talk entitled,
        <i>A Free Society Needs a Free Press</i>. As the government has various
        weapons it can use against the media - and has, as the PA has amply
        demonstrated - the truth is the principle weapon of the media, and it
        must be used if the body politic is to remain healthy.
        <b>Mr. Moshin El-Franji</b>, a Palestinian journalist, echoed the words
        of Adams. His talk,
        <i>The Palestinian Media: Enhancing or Violating Human Rights</i>, posed
        exactly that question. He answered by asserting that the PA has greatly
        hampered the Palestinian media's freedom of expression. "We are forced
        to turn to the Israeli media for information," he said. The only thing
        the Palestinian media enhances is PA policy.
        <b>Mr. Ala' El-Mash'harawi </b>of Al-Quds and Solidarity International
        for Human Rights, then took up the themes El-Franji brought up. His talk
        was entitled,
        <i>Media: The Missing Link in Palestinian Citizen's Rights</i>. People
        are the source of power, he said, and public opinion needs to be
        unfettered, not predisposed. However, the seemingly single voice of the
        panel was challenged during discussion time. Some Palestinian conference
        participants reminded the journalists that they have a responsibility to
        serve the social structure. "We reject fragmentation," as one
        participant said. Another participant pointed out how severely the
        continuing occupation affects the media.</font
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <font color="#000066"
        >The sixth workshop, The Violation of Children's Rights, began with a
        talk by <b>Dr. Ahmad Abdul Baqi</b> of the Uppsala University Hospital
        in Sweden. His speech,
        <i>Childhood Trauma as a Vulnerability Factor</i>, discussed how trauma
        is induced by incidents of violence or mistreatment. Though physical
        trauma tends to heal relatively quickly, psychological trauma may leave
        a lasting imprint on the child. <b>Ms. P.C. Yogaranjanakumari</b>, of
        Survivors Associated, Sri Lanka, gave a talk entitled
        <i>Children of War: Stress Management for Caregivers</i>. She supported
        Dr. Abdul Baqi's assertion that psychological trauma often disrupted the
        individual's social network.<b> Dr. Brian K. Barber</b> of Brigham Young
        University, USA, analyzed the effects of the Intifada on Palestinian
        children in his talk,
        <i
          >Palestinian Child and Adolescent Experience During and After the
          Intifada</i
        >. He found that children who participated in the Intifada, among other
        affects, withdrew socially and were less bound by the authority of their
        parents. Positive family relations also tended to protect children from
        the negative effects of the Intifada. <b>Ms. Ayda Kassab </b>and
        <b>Dr. Samir Qouta</b>, both of GCMHP, then delivered the talk,
        <i>Trauma Dynamics in Children</i>. The main point of the talk was that
        children passive during the Intifada suffered more than children who
        played an active role in the uprising.</font
