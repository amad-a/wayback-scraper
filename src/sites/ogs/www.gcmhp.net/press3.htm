        third international conference held its third day of activities today in
        the Rashad El-Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City, Palestine. The theme
        of this year’s October 13-15 conference is Health and Human Rights. The
        conference brings together over 400 health professionals, scholars, and
        social activists from throughout the world to discuss the still-grim
        situation faced by Palestinians in the occupied territories and
        Palestinian semi-autonomous territory.</font

    <p>
      <font color="#000066"
        >The morning Plenary Session brought together a distinguished panel of
        health professionals, scholars, and social activists. The first speaker
        was Psychiatrist and veteran African National Congress member
        <b>Dr. Freddy Reddy</b> who delivered a presentation on
        <i>Suppression of Human Rights: Psychopathology</i>.<font size="+0">
          Dr. Reddy asserted that over the years doctors have contributed to
          tremendous wrongs perpetrated against innocent people. Sterilization
          and dubious theories about minority groups are marks on the record of
          the health profession. Since the 1970s, however, doctors have become
          more involved in promoting human rights.</font

        ><font size="+0"
          >Dr. Reddy linked the experiences of families in South Africa to those
          in the Gaza Strip when he spoke of suspicion and mistrust being
          rampant within families in both places. The reality was everybody was
          a potential “sell-out.” In an implicit difference with Gaza he
          mentioned how the South African Truth Commission has investigated the
          manner in which clandestine apartheid organizations worked to stop,
          undermine, suppress, and torture opponents.</font

        ><font size="+0"
          >Dr. Reddy spoke of how in the Gaza Strip almost all the people
          suffered from violations of their human rights. Palestinian children
          were the main victims and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder continues in
          them long after the actual experience of trauma. The treatment of
          personal suffering resulting from trauma involves a long process, but
          doctors and health personnel have an obligation to help. Doctors have
          heard the stories and must take responsibility for rendering
          assistance.</font

          >Another ongoing problem for Gazans is unemployment as it destroys
          self-respect and leads to despondency. Unemployment and the resulting
          consequences can happen at any moment with the closing of the border.
          He asserted, however, that people will only take so much before they
          rise up against the suppression of their rights.</font

          ><b>Dr. Juliet Van Eenwyk</b> of the Washington State Department of
          Health spoke on <i>Epidemiology and Human Rights</i>. In her
          presentation she outlined ways in which epidemiology can help protect
          human rights. She asserted that epidemiology can be used to improve
          health in instances in which people are deprived of their human
          rights. Epidemiology can bring human rights abuses to light and
          determine the effectiveness of efforts to raise levels of health and
          human rights. She outlined a number of examples in which epidemiology
          can help improve basic health conditions. In one instance,
          epidemiologists pinpointed the location of the worst outbreak of
          Japanese encephalitis in a Cambodian refugee camp and in another case
          were able to raise questions about whether girls under five in a
          Kurdish refugee camp were getting adequate and clean water compared to
          boys. She also outlined how epidemiologists were able to show impaired
          mental development in children exposed to high levels of chemical
          pollution compared to a similar cohort exposed to a good deal less
          chemical pollution.</font

          ><b>Dr. Khadija Safwat</b> of the Middle Eastern and African Research
          Centre - Wales spoke on
          <i
            >States and People under Siege: The Political Economy of Collective
            Siege and Human Rights</i
          >. She declared that all states are under some form of siege because
          of the reproduction of capital, the lack of loyalty to the state, and
          the cross-boundary nature of the flow of capital. She spoke of looking
          at the situation today as a series of sieges with a siege of Israel, a
          siege of the Palestinian Authority, and indeed a self-imposed
          Palestinian opposition siege.</font

    <p>
      <font color="#000066"
        ><font size="+0"
          >Dr. Safwat stated that Israel is an expensive ghetto that costs the
          West and the U.S. a great deal. Outside Jewish contributions to Israel
          may start to decline as Jews begin to feel increasingly uncomfortable
          with giving so much for building civil society there. Israel is faced
          with the prospect of losing funds in the near future and developing a
          sense of coming under siege. As a result, it may be less willing to
          inflict a siege on the Palestinian economy although it will have to
          compete economically with the Palestinian entity more and more.</font

          >The final speaker of the Plenary Session was
          <b>Dr. Abdel Aziz El-Rantisi</b> of the Islamic University. He spoke
          on <i>Islam and Human Rights</i>. Dr. El-Rantisi stated that ethics
          are to protect human dignity and this is what Islam does. El-Rantisi
          spoke of racial discrimination in the U.S. and the violation of human
          rights by Israel against its Sephardic citizens. He also mentioned
          that Arab municipalities in Israel get smaller budgets than their
          Jewish counterparts.</font

    <p>
      <font color="#000066"
        ><font size="+0"
          >Dr. El-Rantisi asserted that Jews could only find refuge from
          European discrimination in this region. Consequently, he declared that
          Islam is the best means by which to protect human rights. Under Islam,
          man can vote and attain public posts based on qualifications and not
          corruption. Unfortunately, many of those elected in the elections or
          appointed to posts in the Cabinet of the PA are not qualified.</font

    <p>
      <font color="#000066"
        ><font size="+0"
          >Dr. El-Rantisi proceeded to discuss the protections offered by Islam
          to members of minority religions. Killing, according to the Quran, is
          prohibited except in certain prescribed situations and there is a
          heavy penalty for the violation of this prohibition. Furthermore,
          there are specific sayings not to kill oneself.</font

          >El-Rantisi declared that the best struggle is in speaking truth in
          front of an unjust leader. During the question and answer session
          El-Rantisi stated that the Islam he had spoken of was the one sent by
          God and agreed that there are currently no good examples of Islamic
          governments for Palestinians to follow.</font

          >An Awards Ceremony was held after the Plenary Session to honor people
          and organizations making a strong contribution to health and human
          rights in the Gaza Strip. <b>Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj</b> called on Israel
          and the Palestinian Authority to release all political prisoners and
          announced that letters to <b>Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu</b> and
          <b>President Yasser Arafat</b> regarding health and human rights
          concerns were being circulated for the signatures of conference
          participants. <b>Dr. Haidar Abdel Shafi</b> was the first to receive
          an award and was given a warm and moving tribute by Dr. El-Sarraj for
          his many years of work against the Israeli occupation and for the deep
          sense of integrity he exhibited in stepping down from the Palestinian
          Legislative Council (PLC) in a show of displeasure over the lack of
          respect accorded the legislative branch by the executive branch of

          >&nbsp;Three concurrent workshops were held in the morning. The first
          workshop discussed the subject of <b>Children</b>.
          <b>Ms. Frances Moore</b> of Save the Children, UK, discussed the
          origin and objectives of her organization. Her talk, entitled
          <i
            >The Rights of the Vulnerable Sectors in Society - Children’s Rights
            and the Work of SCF</i
          >
          asserted that “The key factor affecting the Palestinian children in
          the occupied territories wathe the closure.” Ms. Moore co-presented
          with human rights specialist, Dan Seymour. Mr. Seymour identified the
          UN Commission on Human Rights as the best forum for addressing
          violations of children’s rights.</font

    <p>
      <font color="#000066"
        ><font size="+0"
          ><b>Dr. Tom Gumpel</b> of Hebrew University argued that Israeli law
          systemically discriminates against children with special needs, both
          Jewish and Arab. His talk,
          <i
            >Special Education Law and Policy in Israel: De Facto Segregation!, </i
          >ended with the assertion that the rights of the disabled are a
          barometer for determining how truly segregated Israeli society is.
          There is certainly a relationship, he said, between the Israeli policy
          to discriminate against children with special needs, and its policy of
          separation between Arabs and Jews.</font

      <font color="#000066"

          ><b>Dr. Abdel Aziz M. Thabit </b>of the GCMHP investigated the effects
          of the occupation and the Intifada on the emotional health of
          Palestinian children. He delivered a disheartening presentation,
          citing how scarred Palestinian children were by the Israeli occupation
          – and how this scar is being transmitted transgenerationally. His talk
          was entitled,
          <i>Post Traumatic Stress Disorders in Children in War</i>. In response
          to a question about how Palestinian children could begin the process
          of normalization, Thabit made clear that until the children are
          allowed access to basic needs, and conditions of poverty and
          overcrowding are alleviated, normalization cannot take place.</font

          Dr. Van Dyke argued that education serves as a basis for everything.
          One positive of the peace agreement is that Palestinians are now
          better able to pursue their education. He added that a Palestinian
          curriculum should be developed based on Palestinian standards.</font

          <i>Women’s Rights in Tribal Traditional Law - The Gaza Strip</i>.
          Khashan pointed out that women who are raped have no rights in tribal
          traditional law and that women who bear sons are looked upon as better

          women from choosing their husbands. This decision is usually made
          instead by the woman’s father, brother, or a male relative. They also
          outlined the consequences of early marriage on women’s health. These

            Participation</i
          >. They stressed the importance of determining where mental health
          services are needed and of providing these services for children and
          adolescents. Such services should also help parents better deal with
          their children.</font

          >&nbsp;<b>Dr. Fat’hi El-Woheidi</b> of Al-Azhar University began the
          third and final afternoon workshop on the subject of
          <b>Ethics and Torture</b> with a talk entitled
          <i>Torture and the Role of Medical Associations</i>. El-Woheidi argued
          that legal protections must be instituted to protect doctors who dare
          to speak out against torture practices. His talk ended with a call to
          justice; he urged that torture not be tolerated in any of its
          forms.</font

          ><b>Mr. Abdel Rahman Abu El-Nasir</b> of the Bar Association - Gaza
          Strip followed. In his talk,
          <i>The Role of the Bar Association in Human Rights</i>, he outlined
          the two roles of the Bar Association. First, the Bar Association has a
          responsibility to publicize information, in particular, information on
          Palestinian prisoners and academic detainees. Secondly, the Bar
          Association has the duty of advocacy. It must campaign against
          injustice and advocate the rights of Palestinian prisoners.</font

          >In the next talk,
          <i>Palestinian Prisoners’ Conditions in Israeli Jails</i>,
          <b>Mr. Faris Abu Hassan</b> of Solidarity International for Human
          Rights - West Bank, asserted that Palestinian political prisoners –
          including administrative detainees – in Israeli jails were provided
          with substandard legal and medical services. Doctors, he asserted,
          have even assisted in the torture of prisoners.</font

          >In the closing ceremony, <b>Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj</b> sounded a call for
          the release of <b>Fat’hi Suboh</b>. In strident words, he invited the
          PA to base its strength on a respect for law and human rights; “only
          then,” he said, “would we gladly sacrifice all we had for the
          Authority”.</font

          ><b>Riyad El-Za’noun</b>, the Palestinian Minister of Health, then
          charged the conference participants with bearing the burden of a
          message, that the Palestinian people demand justice. As in dark times,
          when God sent his emissaries to deliver messages of peace, Za’noun
          called the participants “prophets”, whose mission was to return to
          their homelands and resound the call of justice and the cry of
          injustice on behalf of the continuing Palestinian struggle. Za’noun
          then denounced what he termed Israel’s “starvation policy”. He angrily
          declared that the withholding of funds due Palestine by Israel and the
          international community claimed several thousands of victims, of which
          the nascent Palestinian infrastructure was one. “I have forgotten I am
          a minister,” Za’noun said, referring to the fact that the ministries
          have been closed for over a month.</font

          >Finally, he delivered a moving tribute to his mother, an 89-year-old
          woman who, as Za’noun said, was believed to be crazy by her
          grandchildren because, though she wept for the Palestinians massacred
          at El-Aqsa and Hebron, she wept too for the Israeli victims of the
          latest suicide bombings. “The Israelishave mothers too,” she said.
          Za’noun related that when his mother asked him who the conference
          attendees were, he told her, “They are people like you, who weep when
          Palestinians die, who weep when Israelis die, and who rejoice when
          peace arrives”. “Tell them,” his mother replied, “Um Salim is with
          them”.</font
