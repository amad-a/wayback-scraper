<p>"If I were an Arab leader, I would never make terms with Israel. That is natural: we have taken their country. Sure, God promised it to us, but what does that matter to them? Our God is not theirs... There has been Anti-Semitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was this their fault? They only know but one thing: we have come here and stolen their country. Why would they accept that." End of quote.
<p>What happened at the borders of the "Proposed Palestinian State" would be entirely at the discretion of the Israeli state. The Israeli proposal had other serious defects. It left the Palestinians with a territory riddled with settlements and Israeli-controlled access roads, with supervised ports, immigration, and airspace, with something that would not effectively function as a state. The border restrictions represent the clearest denial of Palestinian sovereignty. A territory is not yours unless you control it, and you do not control it unless you have sovereignty over it. To be offered territory you do not control is to be offered nothing.
<p>"What makes the Israeli position particularly indefensible is its utter gratuitousness. There is no conceivable reason for Israel to promote the settlements that have been the cause of so much misery. The settler movement is built on pseudo-Biblical foolishness, bad history, creed, and-worse-a sort of racist messianism that deserves no tolerance, consideration, or respect. Israel could have not only peace but vastly increased security tomorrow if it chooses: (it has all the options, and the Palestinians none). The fussing about negotiations, trust, and hatred are nothing but self-deceiving excuses for more bloodshed. Given these circumstances it would seem that no one, Jewish or non-Jewish, should support Israel."    
<p>Israel's newest wall<br> is one of many Israeli walls <br>that have been imprisoning and oppressing <br>the native Palestinians for generations.
<p>When completed, the wall will run 759 kilometers. It will then be three times longer than the Israeli-Jordanian border before 1967, enclosing the Jewish state inside one enormous bunker.
<p> The new wall will cut off some 200,000 Palestinians in Greater Jerusalem from their relatives, their natural hinterland, their universities, public institutions, businesses, workshops, and the property they own on the West Bank. Tens of thousands of other Palestinians on either side of the wall will be cut off from their orange and olive groves and their fields.

Because it does not follow the green line but is in fact a prison wall winding threading and encircling part of the Arab population.  Israel's wall is not as long as the Great Wall of China but it is higher, and it dwarfs the communist's Berlin Wall, which was torn down two decades ago.</font>

<p><font color="#FFCC00" size="5"> "A mini-Palestinian state!-defined, as
Sharon would define it, limited as he would limit it, hardly a
sovereign state and barely viable, without links to the outside
world is a gift to Israel, and not to the Palestinians. It is a
ready-made answer to Israel's dilemmas, resolving its demographic
problem, maintaining its security, thwarting the reemergence of a
national Palestinian movement, and, above all, turning an emotional
national struggle into a routine border dispute. This is why statehood,
for which the Palestinians have fought for so long and which Israel has
resisted so fiercely, ironically has now become an Israeli interest and
a Palestinian fear.<br>The so-called roadmap for peace is a
document manufactured elsewhere, chosen by others for Sharon-Arafat-Abu Mazen, to continue their decades-old fight through different means. They have
been at it for long enough; they have seen proposals like these come
and go. So they will adjust. But in truth it is an odd and awkward
choice. Sharon sees the roadmap as a nuisance, Arafat as a diversion;
Abu Mazen alone views it as worthwhile, but then again principally as a
potential way out of the current mess.
<p>The map of a mini-Palestinian state that Sharon
proudly claims he accepts today, surrounded and perforated by Israeli
territory, is the same one he has had in his pocket for the past twenty
years."</i>

<p><center><font color="#009900" size="5">The Road Map for Peace has been officially presented to Israel and the Palestinians and a new (albeit very small) window of opportunity has been opened. This new embodiment of the so-called "Bush vision" for Middle East Peace contains many more questions than answers. The Road Map is so void of important details that even the most experienced navigators will have to locate or even create their own trail markers in order not to get lost on the way. The Road Map is far from anyone's idea of a good plan. Everyone has mostly only bad things to comment on it - the Israelis, the Palestinians, the Europeans, the UN and more. The plan falls far short of where the sides were 33 months ago prior to the outbreak of the intifada in the end of September 2000. But all agree that despite all its many faults, it is the "only game in town".  </font>

Accordingly, the Court has held that the construction of the wall in the occupied territories violates the r�gime of humanitarian and human rights law.

<p> Mitchell Plitnick, Jewish Voices for Peace's Director of Education and Policy, said, "It's wonderful that both sides have pledged to stop bombings and shootings. But as long as other forms of violence continue, the cease-fire will be short-lived. The occupation, with its home demolitions, checkpoints and daily harassments, and a wall slicing through the West Bank and disrupting daily Palestinian life, is itself a constant and massive act of violence."
