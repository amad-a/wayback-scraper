Quote Contribution to Tikkun on the Right of Return <span class="GramE">At</span>
the age of ten, I became a refugee. About a million people met that same fate
in 1948. Their life has suddenly been transformed from a state of tranquillity
to a state of utter destitution: families expelled at gunpoint in the middle of
night or in the heat of a summer day, screams of help, cries of pain, children
lost, mothers clutching pillows instead of their children, thirsty old men shot
in the head if they stopped for water in the forced march, a whole family
dismembered to pieces by a bomb dropped from a plane while having supper,
survivors of (35 reported) massacres walking about in a daze. <br>
The scenes of devastation filled the landscape: the sea of wretched humanity
trailing along the sea coast in Gaza or in the ravines of the West Bank,
resting under a tree, in a mosque or a school, counting their number; the
distraught father or mother rushing back aimlessly looking for a missing loved
one; houses deserted with a bed undone, a hot food in the kitchen; a dog
looking for its owner; plants remain unwatered; cattle and sheep wandering
about out of their open sheds. Screams of Yahud, Yahud (Jews, Jews) are heard
and the tired crowd disperses frantically in crevices and behind rocks. <br>
A jeep with mounted machine guns sprays all moving objects. A plane hovers
gently, almost soundlessly, <span class="GramE">then</span> drops barrels of
destruction on concentrated masses, limbs flying in the air, hanging on a
branch. <br>
All this and more is indelible in my mind, and my children's. Yet my biggest
trauma is not all this. My experience during my expulsion is relatively mild
when compared to thousands who went through all these horrors. My biggest
trauma was that my child's mind could not comprehend that there was such a
cruel, hateful, vengeful enemy who was determined to destroy my life. Why? What
for? What have I, we, done to him? I could not put a face, certainly not a
human face, to him. <br>
You see I have never seen a Jew before, not for many many years after. The
enemy was faceless. I heard all kind of stories: the enemy landed on our
shores, the enemy speaks a bable of languages, has many faces, dialects, but is
united in ruthless destruction of my people. <br>
It took me many years of diligent work to put a face to this enemy. All the
years of my adult life, I carried with me my history, intact and alive, while
my geography was severed from my physical existence, but remained ensconced in
my psyche. I longed for the day of return, when my history and geography are
united again. <br>
You see, I am Palestinian, a typical refugee. Only with the Right of Return
exercised, only with my history and geography united again, then, only then, I,
my children and grandchildren, can shed the title of 'refugee'. Not a day
before. <br>
* * * To the Palestinians, the Right of Return is sacred, legal and possible. <br>
It is sacred because it is embedded in their psyche. Although they have been
dispersed, their family structure is strong. They still marry, across
geographical divides, from the same family had they not been expelled.
According to UNRWA records, fully 72% of villages moved to only one area of the
five UNRWA fields of operation, 20% to two areas and only 8% to three. <br>
It is legal because it is enshrined in international law and the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. It is protected by the sanctity of private
ownership which cannot be extinguished by occupation, sovereignty or passage of
time. No amount of legal sophistry will undermine this right. <br>
Now I advance the thesis that the return is possible. If the reverse is true,
that will not of course nullify or diminish the right of return. Land robbery
does not confer ownership rights. This thesis is aimed at those well-meaning people
who accept the validity of the Palestinian right of return, but fear this may
trigger off another Nakba, a Jewish one this time. They do not want the horror
of Nakba to be experienced again, even by the perpetrators of the original
Nakba. Others claim that the return means the dilution of the Jewish character
of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt">, or as Begin often claimed, the destruction of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt">. <br>
This futile effort is intended only to legitimize material and political gains
made by military conquests. Let us examine these contentions one by one. <br>
* * * Can the refugees return to their homes without causing a reverse exodus?
Is there room for them? <br>
We examined the 46 natural regions of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> and determined for each region the number of urban
and rural Jews, the present Palestinians in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> and the refugees whose homes were in this region.<br>
We then grouped them in three groups: A, B, C a la </span><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">West Bank</span></st1:place><span style="font-size:
24.0pt">. Group A has an area of 1,628 sq. km and has a population of over 3
million Jews, or about 70% of the Jews. <br>
This is the same area and largely in the same location as the land which the
Jews purchased or acquired under British protection in 1948. <br>
Its area is 8% of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:
  24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:
24.0pt">. This is the total extent of Jewish ownership in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt">. <br>
Here is the heaviest Jewish concentration. Area B has a mixed population. Its
area is 6% of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:
  24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:
24.0pt"> and is just less than the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="font-size:24.0pt">land</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size:
 24.0pt"> of </span><st1:placename><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Palestinians</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> who remained in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt">. A further 10% of the Jews live there. Thus, in a
nutshell, 78% of the Jews live in 14% of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt">. That leaves Area C, which is 86% of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt">. <br>
This is largely the land and the home of the Palestinian refugees. <br>
Who lives there today? Apart from the remaining Palestinians, the majority of
the Jews there live in originally Palestinian, now mixed, cities and a few new
towns. The average size of a new town in Area C is comparable to the size of a
refugee camp. <br>
If Jabaliya camp were a town in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt">, its rank in terms of size would be in the top 8% of
Israeli urban centers. Who then controls the vast Palestinian land in area C?
Only 160,000 rural Jews exploit the land and heritage of over 5 million
refugees packed in refugee camps and denied the right to return. The refugees
in Gaza are crammed at a density of 4,200 persons per sq. km. <br>
If you were one of those refugees, and you look across the barbed wire to your
land in Israel, and you see it almost empty, at 5 persons/sq. km, (almost one
thousand times less density than Gaza!) what would you feel? <span class="GramE">Peaceful?</span>
<span class="GramE">Content?</span> <br>
This striking contrast is the root of all the suffering. It can only be eliminated
with the return of the refugees. <br>
What do those rural Jews do? We are told they cultivate the (Palestinian) land
and produce wonderful agriculture. <br>
We are not told that three quarters of the Kibbutz are economically bankrupt
and that only 26% of them produce most of the agriculture. We are not told that
the Kibbutz is ideologically bankrupt; there is constant desertion, and very
few new recruits. Irrigation takes up about 60-80% of the water in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt">, 2/3 of it is Arab water. Agriculture in the southern
district alone uses 500 million cubic meters of water per year. <br>
This is equal to the entire water resources of the </span><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">West Bank</span></st1:place><span style="font-size:
24.0pt"> now confiscated by </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt">. This is equal to the entire resources of upper </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Jordan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> including <span class="GramE">lake</span> Tiberias for
which </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> is obstructing peace with </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Syria</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt">. Total irrigation water, a very likely cause of war,
produces agricultural products worth only 1.8% of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt">'s GDP. Such waste, such extravagance, such disregard
for the suffering of the refugees, and such denial of their rights is exercised
by 8,600 Kibbutzniks who depend on agriculture for their livelihood. <br>
When the refugees return to their land, they can pursue their traditional
agricultural pursuits, and no doubt this will take up the slack in GDP. More
importantly, peace will be a real possibility. <br>
Let us consider two scenarios, which if applied are likely to diffuse much of
the tension in the </span><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Middle East</span></st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">. Let us imagine that the registered refugees in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Lebanon</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> (362,000) are allowed to return to their homes in </span><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Galilee</span></st1:place><span style="font-size:
24.0pt">. Even today, </span><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Galilee</span></st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> is still largely <span class="GramE">Arab.</span>
Palestinians there outnumber the Jews one and a half times. If the Lebanon
refugees return, the Jewish concentration in Area A will hardly feel the
difference, and the Jews will remain a majority in all areas, even when they
are least in number, like area C. <br>
Furthermore, if the 760,000 registered refugees in Gaza are allowed to return
to their homes in the south, now largely empty, they can return to their same
original villages, while the percentage of the Jewish majority in the centre
(area A) will drop by only 6%. The number of these rural Jews who may be
affected by the return of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size:
  24.0pt">Gaza</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size:24.0pt">
refugees to their homes in the south does not exceed 78,000 or the size of a
single refugee camp. <br>
This is a glaring example of the miscarriage of justice Another striking fact
is that the number of Russian immigrants, claiming to be Jews, is almost the
same as that of Lebanon and Gaza refugees combined. <br>
Those refugees are denied the right to return home while the Russian immigrants
are taking their place, their homes and their land. <span class="GramE">So much
for the claim of the physical &quot;impossibility&quot; of the return.</span> <br>
The vacancy of Palestinian land is so problematic to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> that it is trying to find people to live on this
land. None other than Sharon and Eitan started a scheme in 1997 to sell the
refugees' land to builders to build apartments so that an American or
Australian Jew can buy an apartment without being an Israeli. <br>
Kibbutz farmers who rented this land from the Custodian of Absentee (i.e.
refugee) Property <span class="GramE">received a &quot;</span>compensation&quot;
up to 25% of its sale value. This illegal activity, selling a land in custody,
prompted the UN to issue resolutions affirming the entitlement of the refugees
to receive any income of their property for the last 50 years and calling on
all states to present all documents and information they may have on the
refugees' property. <span class="GramE">Now it is often said that Israelis oppose
the return of the refugees for fear that this will change the Jewish character
of the state.</span> <br>
What do they mean by the phrase &quot;Jewish character&quot;? Do they mean
legal, social, demographic or religious character? Let us examine these one by
one. First, what is the legal meaning of the Jewish character? In the words of
a noted Jurist, (Mallison): <br>
&quot;The Jewish character is really a euphemism for the Zionist discriminatory
statutes of the State of Israel which violate the human rights provisions The
UN is under no more of legal obligation to maintain Zionism in Israel than it
is to maintain apartheid in the Republic of South Africa.&quot; <br>
In March 2000, the reports of UN Treaty-Based Committees, such as Human Rights
Committee, Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Committee on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and Committee against Torture, have all
condemned Israeli practices and characterized, for the first time so clearly,
the exclusive structure of the Israeli law as the root cause of all those
violations of international law. <br>
How, then, can the international community accept the premise of a &quot;Jewish
character&quot; as a basis for the denial of the right to return home? If they
mean a social Jewish character, this idea is clearly a misnomer. There is not
much in common between a Brooklyn Jew and an Ethiopian Jew, or between a
Russian claiming to be a Jew and a Moroccan Jew. The gulf between the Ashkenazi
and the Haredim can never be bridged. <br>
The Sephardim (Mizrahim) are allocated the lower rings of the social ladder. </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Jerusalem</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> and Tel Aviv are being polarised on sectarian lines. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> has long given up on the idea of a melting pot. There
are 32 languages spoken in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt">. Prof. Etzioni Halevi of </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Bar</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size:
 24.0pt"> </span><st1:placename><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Ilan</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size:24.0pt">University</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> and a specialist on the Jewish national identity
says, &quot;we are not a single people, language is different, attire is
different, behaviour and attitude are different, even the sense of identity is
different.&quot; <br>
How can then the Palestinians, the inhabitants of 530 depopulated towns and
villages be the odd element in this mosaic? If they mean by the Jewish
character the numerical superiority of Jews, they have to think again. The
Palestinians who remained in their homes now represent 26% of all Jews. How
could </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> ignore their presence? Will </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> plan another massive ethnic cleansing operation? <span class="GramE">Very unlikely.</span> <br>
They are there to stay and increase. In the year 2010, Palestinians in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> will be 35% of Jews and they will be equal to the
number of Jews in 2050 or much earlier when immigration dries up. <br>
So what is the value of chasing an elusive target while innocent people wait in
the refugee camps? If they mean the religious Jewish character, who says this
is in danger? For one thousand years, the Jews did not find a haven anywhere
for their religious practice better than the Arab world. One must conclude
therefore that the clich</span><span style="font-size:24.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&#65533;</span><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> &quot;Jewish character&quot; is only meant to justify
keeping the land and expelling its people. <br>
In practical terms, it is entirely feasible to plan the return in such a way
and in such phases that the Je-wish residents will not feel any effect, except
the pleasant feeling that a true peace is a reality at last But the Israelis
must come to terms with al Nakba, the Palestinian holocaust, and its
consequences. They must shed their collective amnesia about the Palestinians,
the notion that they landed in an empty country, conquered 530 empty towns and
villages, cultivated a land where oranges, olives and wheat grew by divine
intervention, and found urban and rural landscape carved by genies. They must
learn to live with the Palestinians, not instead of them. They must believe
that: no return means <span class="GramE">no</span> peace. <span class="GramE">Unquote

It is &quot;harsh&quot;. I am not clear what you mean by this description. If
you mean the description I gave to the treatment meted out to the Palestinians,
this is a correct description. Every word in my piece (p. 1) can be corroborated
by dozens of refugees. <br>
If you refer to my research about demography, Jewish character etc., I have not
heard any one yet challenging the facts, although this study was read at the
Israeli Anthropological Annual Conference in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Jerusalem</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> in May 2000 and published by Ha'aretz on </span><st1:date year="2000" day="23" month="7"><span style="font-size:24.0pt">23 July 2000</span></st1:date><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> (Hebrew edition only). <br>
Jews are refugees too. Palestinians refused to share the land. This is your
long-held view (Tikkun, p. 46, Vol. 4, No. 5). <br>
You add that &quot;the collision of two nationalisms led directly to the
creation of the Arab refugee problem&quot;. The overwhelming evidence of
thousands of testimonies of refugees, now supported by evidence in the
declassified Israeli, British and American files, give a different and more
graphic picture. It clearly shows a pattern of a determined, well-planned and
sustained campaign (till today) of ethnic cleansing against the Palestinians.
Zionists wanted Palestine Arabrein. If Zionists wanted to 'share' land, the
Palestinians would have welcomed them as they did German Templars, Circassians,
Bosnians, Armenians and others. In fact that is what they did until the
infamous Balfour declaration. <br>
<span class="GramE">To publish or not.</span> I cannot argue with an editor, can
I? If you would not, others would. But I thought the idea was to inform US Jews
particularly. My guess is that they have a distorted idea of the Palestinians.
They would do themselves a favour (at least in the long run) to learn more
facts about the Palestinians before events rush them and then they complain
about the &quot;irrational&quot; </span><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Middle

The place to deal with those is the Truth and Conciliation Commission or the
International Criminal Court. The right wing Israelis aim to complete the
ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, by continued exile, or by resettlement
anywhere in the world except their homes. <br>
The Palestinians are determined to defend themselves against this Nakba.
History tells us that determined defenders win. In conclusion, if you find any
merit in informing your readers of the general Palestinian position, I am
prepared to reduce the length closer to your limit of 1600 words. I understand
your concerns but I hope they can be met without sacrificing the truth. <br>

Dear Salman Abu Sitta: <br>
I have trouble understanding the underlying strategic vision of people who hold
your position. My view is that the Palestinian people should build a movement
fully committed to non-violence, and with realizable goals (a Palestinian state
on almost all the </span><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">West Bank</span></st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> and </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Gaza</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size:24.0pt">, with dismantling of the settlements and no Israeli
military presence). <br>
That is realizable, and should include massive aid to resettle Palestinians in
the </span><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">West Bank</span></st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">, so that millions could return to that Palestinian
state. In that context, I believe that the world and a significant section of
the Israeli public and world Jewry could become your active allies. I have
watched other oppressive states like England in India, South Africa, and the
American southern racist states melt under the moral pressure mobilized by that
kind of nonviolent movement led by people like Gandhi and Martin Luther King
Jr. <br>
I cannot see how anyone can imagine that the Palestinian people will ever win
anything unless they adopt this kind of movement that creates a moral split in
the Jewish people between those who care for human rights and those who do not.
<br>
So, taking the stance that rejects both non-violence and achievable goals of
the sort I mentioned, and clinging to violent struggle plus maximalist demands
(right of return) is simply a choice to perpetuate the Occupation. <br>
Now, I can't see how that is in the best interests of the Palestinian people,
so I don't understand the choice. Is it the belief on the part of some
significant section of the Palestinians who took the oath you mentioned that
they can militarily defeat </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt">? <span class="GramE">If so, how?</span> If not, then
aren't you choosing to perpetuate decades of Occupation? I really don't
understand-and hope you would take a minute to explain the strategic vision
underlying this approach. As to the article, I've missed the March deadline, so
now I'd like to turn to the next issue of the magazine. I think what I would
like to do is this: create a roundtable discussion (on the telephone) with some
Palestinians and some peace-oriented Jews to have this discussion. <br>
There would be maybe 6 people, and we would tape the discussion. . Would you be
willing to be part of such a discussion which would then be edited and used in
the magazine? And is there someone else you highly recommend to be part of it?
I want your perspective to be heard. But knowing how many Jews in America today
see me as a crazy self-hating Jew who is really a Palestinian apologist, and
then recognizing that even I can't understand the perspective that insists on
return to Israel except by people who have given up on anything real and so
must retain fantasies of destroying the Jewish state altogether, I can only
imagine how others who think I am extreme would react. <br>
Still, my goal is to present an honest and accurate picture, and that's why I
think a roundtable might work. What do you think? <br>

Rabbi Lerner, <br>
This is turning into some sort of debate. I hope it will help. You have trouble
in understanding my/our strategic vision. <br>
You advise that our strategy to recover our rights should have two qualities: <br>
(a) non-violent <br>
(b) realizable. <br>
I think you better direct this <span class="GramE">advise</span> to the Zionist
movement. This is why. <br>
(a) Non-violence The first military militia was organized by Trempledor in the
twenties, followed by the Haganah, Irgun and Stern gangs. Just before the end
of the British Mandate, Ben Gurion went through his fourth version (Plan Dalet)
of the plan for the destruction of Palestine; yes, it said plainly: destruct,
expel, occupy, clear ...etc. <br>
You must know, by now, that before the British departure, Ben Gurion amassed
65,000 trained soldiers, many of them were veterans of World War II, to conquer
about 650 Palestinian towns and villages, which were defended by dozens of
poorly-armed peasants in each village, totalling no more than 2,500. <br>
You must know that, with this force, Ben Gurion managed to expel half of the
refugees before an Arab soldier set foot on </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Palestine</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> soil. You must know that half of the 17 reported
massacres took place before the British departure and </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt">'s creation. <br>
Arab forces tried to rescue the remainder of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Palestine</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size:24.0pt">, but they obviously failed. Ultimately Ben Gurion
expelled the inhabitants of 530 towns and villages and confiscated their land
and property. So, who is to be advised to be non-violent? Who today possesses
the most lethal weapons of mass destruction? <br>
Who is responsible for the longest trail of blood, the largest volume of
destruction and the highest record of world condemnation? <br>
Does it surprise you to know that the Zionists/Israelis have not ever
experienced the ravages of war domestically? never had whole villages destroyed
as in Palestine, never had whole town quarters destroyed as in Beirut and Suez,
never had water and electricity cut or railway lines ripped off as in many
parts of Palestine, never had hundreds of victims lying dead as in Sabra,
Shatila or Cana, or children heads smashed by hammers as in Dawayima, pregnant
women stomachs ripped open as in Deir Yassin, or old men and women burnt alive
as in Lajjun. <br>
Yes, there were feeble attempts at dropping stray bombs on Tel Aviv (by </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Egypt</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> in 1948 and Saddam in 1991). <br>
Yes, there is fear gripping the Israelis. But that is a chronic Jewish ailment.
<br>
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt">'s actions are like the one who commits an actual
murder on the pretext that the victim may think one day of harming him. No,
Rabbi. <br>
You are preaching at the wrong synagogue, so to speak. Please deliver this
sermon to those who need it. (By the way, I did not advocate violence. <br>
Where did you get this idea? I think that the moral power, especially in the
current surge in human rights advocacy and high-tech communications, is the
biggest support for Palestinians today.) <br>
(b) Realizable aims If Herzl heard you, he will laugh. Imagine Jews meeting in
a </span><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Basle</span></st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> hotel room in 1897, and planning to expel millions of
people and occupy five countries. Is that realizable? <br>
Imagine Ben Gurion pleading with Peel Commission in 1937 asking for a Tel Aviv
area to cede from </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Palestine</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size:24.0pt">, while in his mind he wants to conquer all of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Palestine</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size:24.0pt">, as he told Baltimore Conference in 1942! Is this
realizable? Yes he did it and more. <br>
Now, the Palestinians' aims are more modest. They do not want to attack any
body. They simply want to return home. This return has nothing to do with
politics, sovereignty, occupation or even apartheid. <br>
They lived in their homes under Memlukes, Ottomans, British and some under
Israelis. You see they do not have 'aims'; they have rights. Because these
rights are Inalienable, they represent the bottom red line beyond which no
concession is possible. <span class="GramE">Because doing so will destroy their
life.</span> That they will not permit. You say: can they militarily defeat </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt">? I do not know. <br>
I do not think this is the main issue. Let us remember that </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> did not win, the Arab lost. This is not just playing
with words. Tell me of one 'real' war (except in 1973) in the last 50 years. <br>
But if we are talking 'realism', let us consider the following<span class="GramE">:</span><br>
In spite of many attempts at their destruction, Palestinians did not vanish. <br>
They (88% of the refugees) are in and around </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Israel</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size:24.0pt">. Depth behind them is limitless. <br>
If 99% admit they have no rights whatsoever, the 1% means 10,000 angry people
in each of the five UNRWA <span class="GramE">area</span>. With local support,
they can seriously influence events. So the motto: no return = no peace is not
without foundation. <br>
No human being will accept less than his fundamental human rights, which
include the return to one's home. You can bargain on secondary levels of
rights, political, economic or cultural, but not something that basic. <br>
How do you expect the refugees to accept their fate and remain in exile when
they see a million Russians (with little or no links to the land) living in
their homes and in their land? <br>
How could any self-respecting Israeli to live in a house or on a land robbed
from its owner? Refugees consider every Israeli, who lives, willingly, in their
homes and on their land and deny them the right to return, to be their
adversary, until he ceases to do so. <br>
So, the Israelis should be advised to abandon violence and seek realizable
aims. That is, they cannot continue to destroy the Palestinians and deny their
human rights. Jabotinsky's 'iron wall' brought blood and fire but will never
bring permanent peace. <br>
Jews have no moral right to preach the west for what was done to them in the
tragic years of World War II when they continue to inflict destruction on the
Palestinians for all the years since then. They should shed their collective
amnesia. If they want to live within the family of nations, they should first
learn to live in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size:24.0pt">Palestine</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size:24.0pt"> with (not instead of) its people. <br>
<span class="GramE">The Article in March issue.</span> I am sorry you missed the
deadline for publishing my article. I did my best to respond to your request by
writing within 6 days of request. Now, I think there are two approaches: <br>
1) <span class="GramE">Either</span> you publish my piece and other
contributions. Then I could have the opportunity to comment on them or <br>
2) you organize a small (or big if you can) conference on the Right of Return
in which Palestinians, Israelis and neutral participants would attend. <br>
This way various aspects of the issue will be examined in a productive manner.
Hopefully some useful conclusions may be drawn from it. <br>
I appreciate your continuing to explore the 'other' view. <br>
