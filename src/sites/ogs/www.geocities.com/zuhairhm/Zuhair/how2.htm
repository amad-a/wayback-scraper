<p><font color="#009900">  The Arabs, Muslim and Christian, were promised independence and self-government after WWI.  In the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090209080930/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/hussmac1.html"><font color="#FFCC00"> McMahon correspondence</a></font>, the British promised independence to the Arabs, including the Palestinians, if they would fight against Turkey who was allied with Germany (Remember Lawrence of Arabia?).  President Woodrow Wilson also declared that WWI was fought to make the world safe for democracy. The 12th of his Fourteen Principles for the post-war world was:
<p><font color="#FF0000">  "The Turkish portions of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule (e.g. Arabs) should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development."</font> 
<p>Had the Western world adhered to Wilson's admirable program, the Ninth Crusade against the Muslim would never have begun and there would be no war in the Middle East today.  The Arab people, just released from Turkish domination, would have decided what states to create and who would rule them.  They could have entered the world as democratic and prosperous nations.  However, Wilson was unable to force his program on the war-mongering colonialists of Britain and France.  They insisted on occupying the Arab Middle East.  Instead of democracy and self-rule, the Arabs got military occupation by the Western powers.  France took control of what became Lebanon and Syria, and Britain occupied what became Iraq, Jordan, and Palestine.  (Shamed by what happened to British honor, Lawrence returned his medals to the British government).
<p>He promised Arabs independence from the �hateful Ottomans�, but nothing good came out of their betrayal: British, American and later Zionist colonizers shared the spoils, while the natives became even more oppressed.

<p align="center"><i><font color="#009900"><b>In 1916 AD the British Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs Arthur James Balfour prepared a letter which was issued in November 2nd, 1917 AD
expressing government approval of Zionism with "The establishment in Palestine of a
national home for the Jewish people". This letter is called 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090209080930/http://www.lib.byu.edu/~rdh/wwi/1917/balfour.html"><font color="#FFCC00">Balfour Declaration </font></a>"His
Majesty's Government view with favor the establishment in Palestine of a
National Home for the Jewish people...<font color="#FF0000">it being clearly understood that
nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights
of the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine</font>."<font color="#FFCC33"> The latter phrase has
all but disappeared from the Western media and from the history of this problem.</font>
<p>The letter was addressed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090209080930/http://www.gold-eagle.com/gold_digest/markus112297.html"> <font color="#FFCC00"> Lord Rothschild</font></a>, who was a member of the Jewish international BANKING
family, and who generously offered loan after loan to the Bank of England. Nathan Rothschild was quoted: "I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule the Empire on which the sun never sets. <font color="#FF0000"> The man who controls Britain's money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British money supply."</font> It has been said that "the wealth of Rothschild consists of the bankruptcy of nations". Edmond James Rothschild (1845 - 1934) helped to finance the
establishment of Jewish communities in Palestine.
<p><font color="#FF0000"> One of the things that made the Balfour Declaration such an astonishing document and commitment was that<font color="#FFCC00" size="6"> Britain </font>had no right of any kind to give Palestine away, in whole or in part, to anybody.
<p> Britain with the Balfour Declaration had had no right to give away what it did not possess.</font>
<p> The British government, as author of the Balfour Declaration, possessed no sovereighnty or domination in Palestine enabling it to make a valid promise of any rights, whatever their nature and extent, in favour of the Jews of the world. It is immaterial whether these rights were meant to be territorial, political or cultural. On the date that the Balfour Declaration was made, Palestine formed part of Turkey, and neither its territory nor its people were under the jurisdiction of the British Government. The Declaration was void on the basis of the principle that a donor cannot give away what does not belong to him. By itself the Balfour Declaration was legally impotent.
<p> Those responsible for drafting the Balfour Declaration had been unable to bring themselves to acknowledge the existence of the Arabs of Palestine as a people. The term "Arab" or "Arabs" did not appear in the Balfour Declaration. It reduced the 93 per cent Arab majority to "existing non-Jewish communities". That was an expression, a formula, which could only have been invented to serve a hidden agenda.
<p> Britain played the Arab card, promising them independence after they revolted against the Turks, and having played it, Britain then betrayed the Arabs, the Arabs of Palestine most of all,<font color="#FF0000"> and the Arabs made the mistake of trusting the British.</font>  
<p> For Britain the promise was to maintain an "Empire", and later on, for the Americans the case was to create one.
<p>Britain has used Zionism to further its imperial ambitions in 1917, and later on, in the mid 1950s, <font color="#FF0000">Americans, who were seeking merit in the idea of using Zionism to serve America's unstated but nontheless real imperial ambitions. </font>The Zionists understood that anything the British had done, the Americans could do bigger and better.
<p> There was also a particular strategic consideration which played a part in motivating Britain to issue the Balfour Declaration. It was the need to protect the Suez Canal, which was vital for the maintenence of "the spinal cord" of the British Empire. Weizmann in his book "Trial and Error" recalled a conversation he had on the subject of the Canal with Lord Robert Cecil, British's assistant secretary os state for foreign affairs. He said: "Jewish Palestine would be a safeguard to England, in particular in respect to the Suez Canal."
<p> Edwin Samuel Montagu - the only Jewish Englishman in the British cabinet and Secretary of State for India - issued a memorandum marked SECRET and dated 23 August 1917, insisting that any declaration Balfour might make had to contain safeguards for the rights of the Arabs in Palestine. Montagu was a passionate anti-Zionist and lead the fight against the creation of a Jewish state. Montagu's memorandum was not de-classified, not considered to be fit for public consumption, until 1970. It was suppressed for more than half a century. Montagu said:<font color="#FF0000"> "Zionism has always seemed to me to be a mischievous political creed, untenable by any patriotic citizen of the United Kingdom."</font>
<p> Another quote from Montagu:
<p><font color="#FF0000"> I would willingly disenfranchise every Zionist. I woud almost be tempted to proscribe the Zionist Organization as illegal and against the national interests....</font>
<p> On March 5, 1919 the New York Times revealed that 30 of the most prominent and outstanding Jewish Americans had signed a petition to President Wilson. It was a fiercely anti-Zionist petition. In their petition the anti-Zionist Jewish Americans warned against any U.S. commitment "now or in the future to Jewish territorial soverienty in Palestine." Such a demand, the anti-Zionists said, "not only misrepresented the trend of the history of the Jews who ceased to be a nation 2,000 years ago, but involves the limitation and possible annulment of the larger claim of Jews for full citizenship and human rights in all lands in which those human rights are not yet secure."
<p> The anti-Zionist petition to President Wilson contained this statement:
<p><font color="#FF0000"> " It is not true that Palestine is the national home of the Jewish people, and of no other people... To subject Jews to the possible recurrence of such bitter and sanguinary conflicts, which would be inevitable, would be a crime against the triumph of their whole past history and against the lofty and world-embracing visions of their great prophets and leaders... Whether the Jews be regarded as a 'race' or as a religion, it is contrary to democratic principles for which the World War was waged to found a nation on either or both of these bases."</font>
<p> President Wilson appointed King-Crane commission of inquiry in Palestine. On the subject of the Balfour Declaration, King and Crane wrote this:<font color="#FF0000"> "A national home is not equivalent to making Palestine into a Jewish state nor can the erection of such a Jewish state be accomplished without the graveest trespass upon the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish communities."</font>
<p> On 2 October, 1919 President Wilson suffered a thrombosis, a stroke, and was incapacitated.     
<p> Balfour himself said in a memorandum on 11 August 1919 which was prepared for the Paris Peace Conference:
<p><font color="#FF0000"> "In Palestine we do not propose even to go through the form of consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country... The four great powers are committed to Zionism. And Zionism, be it right or wrong, good or bad, is rooted in age long tradition, in present needs, in future hopes, of far profounder import than the desires prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land."</font>

<p>Mayer Amshel Rothschild, the founder of the Rothschild fortune, at the time of his death in 1812, created a trust of his estate, by will, for the elevation of the Jewish race and the establishment of a Jewish World Empire. The estate has been preserved and managed since his death as a unit in pursuance of the provisions of his will.
<p>Arthur Koestler wrote that in the letter "one nation solemnly promised to a second nation the country of a third." More than that, the country was still part of the Empire of a fourth, namely Turkey."</font>
<p>David Hirst, commenting on the vagueness of the Balfour Declaration, says that
<p>"The document bears Balfour's name, but in reality it was the Zionists themselves who, in very large measure, both inspired the Declaration and framed its text. It must be reckoned the finest flower of Zionist diplomacy at its most sophisticatedly ambivalent....suffice it to say here... that the Zionists who framed the declaration saw in it the charter of a future Jewish state..." 
<p>
If, as the Israelis insist, that "national home" was actually become a state of
Israel, then the intention of the Declaration was to create two states in
Palestine, one Jewish and one non-Jewish. <font color="#FF0000">Some 85 years later the latter
state has still not come into existence.</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Winston Churchill wrote in 1920
immediately following his assertion that Bolshevism is led and initiated
mostly by Jews:
<p>"But if, as may well happen, there should be created in our life time by the
banks of the Jordan a Jewish State under the protection of the British
Crown, which might comprise three or four millions of Jews, an event would
have occurred in the history of the world which would, from every point of
view be beneficial, and would be especially in harmony with the truest
interests of the British Empire"</font>
<p><u>I quote Uri Avnery (April 9, 03 article):</u>
<p>"The Balfour declaration of 1917, that promised the Jews a homeland in Palestine, had two parents. The mother was Christian Zionism (among whose adherents were illustrious statesmen like Lord Palmerston and Lord Shaftesbury, long before the foundation of the Zionist movement), the father was British imperialism. The Zionist idea allowed the British to crowd out their French competitors and take possession of Palestine, which was needed to safeguard the Suez Canal and the shorter sea route to India."
<p> The most preposterous Zionist slogan
from the early days was to describe Palestine as "a land without people for a
people without land." This was propagated by irresponsible journalists
who should have ridiculed it whenever they mentioned it. Obviously that
land was inhabited by a great many people, including quite a few who were Jews.
<p>Golda Meir, the Israeli Prime Minister, considered by Israelis as a great leader and by others as one of history's great killers, disputed the facts and said:<font color="#FF0000"> "It was not as though there was a Palestinian people in Palestine and we came and threw them out and took their country away from them. They did not exist."</font>
<p>A quote from Robert John's Paper Presented to the Fifth International Revisionist Conference titled:
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090209080930/http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v06/v06p389_John.html"><font color="#FFCC00"> <p><center>"Behind the Balfour Declaration:</a><p><center> Britain's Great War Pledge To Lord Rothschild"</font>
<p>
<p>
"The Balfour Declaration may be the most extraordinary document produced by any Government in world history. It took the form of a letter from the Government of His Britannic Majesty King George the Fifth, the Government of the largest empire the world has ever known, on which -- once upon a time -- the sun never set; a letter to an international financier of the banking house of <a href="RothschildDinasty.htm"><font color="#FF0000">Rothschild</a></font> who had been made a peer of the realm."
<p><font color="#FF0000">Congressman Louis T. McFadden who, for more than ten years, served as chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee, stated that the international bankers are a "dark crew of financial pirates who would cut a man's throat to get a dollar out of his pocket... They prey upon the people of these United States." </font>
<p>Arthur Koestler wrote that in the letter (Balfour Declaration):<p> <font color="#FF0000">one nation solemnly promised to a second nation the country of a third. More than that, the country was still part of the Empire of a fourth, namely Turkey.</font>
<p> "To the Arabs, the Balfour Declaration was a betrayal of Arab nationalism and, while promising to protect their rights, was simply an attempt to legitimize Jewish political domination over Palestine in complete disregard to the numerical superiority of the Arabs and the Wilsonian principles of majority rule and self-determination".
<p> Before the Europeans went to World War I the guiding principles of the foreign policy President Wilson wanted to pursue were these: a refusal to exert America's material power against weaker nations; a belief that the rights and interests of small nations should be respected; and the view that peoples then dominated by the big European powers should be set on the road to self-determination. Woodrow Wilson was a man of many abilities who wanted to use the power of the presidency to change the world for the better; and who really believed that doing so was a mission impossible. Wilson was a political scientist and historian and received his Ph.D. after advanced studies in government and history at the Johns Hopkins university.
<p> But President Wilson failed. Whether the retreat would have happened if President Wilson had not suffered a stroke at a critical moment is a good question.
<p><font color="#FF0000"> Because of that failure America would become with time the leading supporter of Israel right or wrong; a fact of international life that allowed the Zionist state to behave without regard for international law and, along the way, to pursue, with an arrogance to match its overwhelming military might, expansionist policies which heaped humiliation  after humiliation upon all Arabs and the entire Moslem world. The phenomenon of Anti-Americanism has its origins in America's retreat from the moral high ground in 1919.</font> 
<p><u>Winston Churchill:</u> "In 1956 Churchill told President Eisenhower, "I am, of course, a Zionist, and have been ever since the Balfour Declaration." ( Herbert Mitgang, "The Official Churchill in One Volume," N.Y. Times, Nov. 6, 1991)."
</p>
<p>The Zionists promptly seized upon the Balfour Declaration as justification for its intent to establish a completely Jewish State in Palestine. Among other claims it announced that "Palestine is to become as Jewish as England is English." </p>

<p><center><font color="#FF0000">Who are the real terrorists in the Middle East?</font> 
<p>"The very creation of Israel required an act of terror. In 1948, most of the non-Jewish indigenous people were ethnically cleansed from the part of Palestine which became Israel. This action was carefully planned. Without it, no state with a Jewish majority and character would have been possible. 
<p>Since 1948, the "Israeli Arabs", those Palestinians who avoided expulsion, have suffered continuous discrimination. Indeed, many have been internally displaced, ostensibly for "security reasons", but really to acquire their lands for Jews. 
<p>Surely Holocaust memory and Jewish longing for Eretz Israel would not be sufficient to justify ethnic cleansing and ethnocracy? To avoid the
destabilization that would result from ethical inquiry, the Israeli state must hide the core problem, by nourishing a victim mentality among Israeli Jews.
<p>  Jews today have a strong influence on the most powerful country in the world, and the Holocaust played an important role in the establishment of the State of Israel.
<p><center><img src="/web/20090209080930im_/http://geocities.com/zuhairhm/Zuhair/bar3.gif">
<p align="center"><font color="FF0000">
The World Zionist movement, as its Jewish founders called themselves, had plans to acquire a homeland for all Jews worldwide, even though most were far from homeless, and many did not want another home. 
 It arose in the late 19th century and in 1897 Theodor Herzl, a Hungarian-born Jew who worked as a journalist and playwright in Vienna, the capital of Austro-Hungarian Empire, organized the first Zionist congress in Basel, Switzerland, and founded a permanent World Zionist Organization.
<p>No wonder Albert Einstein objected to the establishment of the State of Israel when Truman gave Israel the go-ahead. Albert also turned down the offer to be president of Israel and the Likud Party was branded by prominent US Jews as being Racist, Fascist and Superstitious.
<p>Albert Einstein, Sidney Hook, Hannah Arendt and twenty-five other prominent Jews, in a letter to The New York Times (December 4, 1948), condemned Menachem Begin's and Yitzhak Shamir's Likud party as "fascist" and espousing "an admixture of ultra-nationalism, religious mysticism and racial superiority." The same theme is echoed in William Zukerman's 1934 article in The Nation, "The Menace of Jewish Fascism. " This is also the premise of Michael Selzer's book, The Aryanization of the Jewish State.
<p>"That biblical promise is Israel's only claim to legitimacy. But whatever God meant when he promised Abraham that "unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the Euphrates," it is doubtful that he intended it to be used as an excuse to take by force and chicanery a land lawfully inhabited and owned by others."
<p>"Compared to the power of this myth, does it really matter that the Exodus from Egypt never took place? Thousands of Egyptian documents deciphered in recent years leave no room for doubt: the exodus of masses of people, as described in the Bible, or anything remotely like it, just never happened. These documents, which cover in the finest detail every period and every part of Canaan during this epoch prove beyond any doubt that there was no "Conquest of Canaan" and no kingdom of David and Solomon. For a hundred years, Zionist archeologists have devoted tireless efforts to finding even a single piece of evidence to support the Biblical narrative, all to no avail."

<p> The Biblical law that God will not allow a disobedient Jewish nation to dwell in Palestine is one of the most emphasized doctrines of the Old Testament. It is stated in the clearest language more than two dozen times in Leviticus and Deuteronomy alone! Nowhere does the Bible hint that Jews can return as a nation in unrighteousness, as they did during the 20th century.
<p> <font color="#FFCC00">�Remember�the word that Thou didst command Thy servant Moses, saying, �If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples; but if you return to Me and keep My commandments and do them, though those of you who have been scattered were in the most remote parts of the heavens, I will gather them there and will bring them to the place where I have chosen to cause My name to dwell.�" (Neh. 1:9

<p>I refer to a book "The Bible Unearthed: Archeology's New Version of Ancient Israel and the Origin of its Sacred Texts". The authors are Israel Finkelstein, director of an archaeological institute at Tel Aviv University, and Neil Asher Silberman, director of a Belgian archaeological institute. They found that the "great" Jewish kingdom existed in something like their fabled extent for a tiny fraction of the period traditionally alleged. Their boundaries never came close to the "Greater Israel" of contemporary Jewish fundamentalism. The rest of the time, Judah and Israel are thought to have been, for the most part, very primitive entities, devoid of literate culture or substantial administrative structure, extending to only a small, landlocked part of what is now called Palestine. The great structure of the Biblical era are, all of them, attributed to Canaanite cultures. The authors refer to the Biblical kingdom at its greatest extent as a "multi-ethnic society." The idea that such a past could validate a Jewish historical claim to Palestine is simply ludicrous, even if it could be shown-which it cannot- that today's Jews are in some legal sense, heirs to the ancient Israelite kingdoms.

<p align="left"><i>In December 1917 during World War I the
British General Sir Edmund Allenby, with the help of the Arab Revolt against the Turkish rulers, captured Jerusalem from the Turks, and by October 1918
occupied the rest of Palestine. Relying on British assurances and promises, given by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090209080930/http://www.lucidcafe.com/library/95aug/lawrence.html"><font color="#FFCC00">Lawrence</a> </font>the Arabs had no doubt that their sacrifices and military successes would justify Britain's recognition and support of Arab nationalism. At the same time the British wanted to use the Jews as a wedge against France and split the Arab Nation by creating a<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090209080930/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(mandate)"><font color="#FF0000"> British Mandate </a></font>over Palestine (and later creating the State of Israel). The Mandate violated the sovereignty of the people of Palestine and their natural rights of independence and self-determination. Palestine was the national home of the Palestinians from time immemorial. The establishment of a national home there for an alien people was a violation of the legitimate and fundamental rights of the Palesinian inhabitants.
<p> In Britain the House of Lords opposed the incorporation of the Balfour Declaration in the Mandate. On 21 June 1922 there was a debate in that House on a motion declaring the Mandate to be unacceptable in its present form-i.e. because it did incorporate the Balfour Declaration. Speaking for the motion, Lord Islington said that in its existing form the Mandate directly violated the pledges made by His Majesty's Government to the people of Palestine. In the course of his prophetic speech he said the following: "In fact, very many orthodox Jews, not only in Palestine but all over the world, view with the deepest misapprehension, not to say dislike, this principle of a Zionist home in Palestine...The scheme of Zionist Home seeks to make Zionist political predominance effective in Palestine by importing into the country extraneous and alien Jews from other parts of the world...It is literally inviting subsequent catastrophe...What we have done, by concession, not to the Jewish people but to a Zionist extreme section, is starting a running sore in the East, and no one can tell how far that sore will extend." Lord Islington had pointed out that the Mandate's provisions concerning the establishment of a Jewish national home were inconsistent with Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. Article 22 was of supreme importance because it was the one that defined the basic objective of the Mandate system. It was to assure "the well-being and development" of the peoples inhabiting the Mandated territories; an objective described by Article 22 as forming "a sacred trust of civilisation." Lord Islington addressed the House of Lords and said: "When one sees in Article 22... that the well-being and development of such peoples should form a sacred trust of civilisation, and when one takes that as the keynote of the Mandatory system, I think your Lordship will see that we are straying down a very far path when we are postponing self-government in Palestine until such time as the population is flooded with an alien race."  
<p> The Arabs were disappointed and betrayed with the breaking of British promises,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090209080930/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/sykes.htm"><font color="#FFCC00"> Sykes-Picot Agreement: 1916</a></font>.

<p>  Before the 20th century, most Jews in Palestine belonged to old Yishuv, or community, that had settled more for religious than for political reasons. There was little if any conflict between them and the Arab population. It should be remembered that for 1400 years, while European Jews saw pogroms, the Inquisition and the Holocaust, Jews were not persecuted in Muslim countries and, indeed, for long periods in Spain and elsewhere, were partners in a marvelous Muslim-Jewish symbiosis. Tensions began after the first Zionist settlers arrived in the 1880's...when [they] purchased land from absentee Arab owners, leading to dispossession of the peasants who had cultivated it.

 <p>  "The indigenous Jews of Palestine also reacted negatively to Zionism. They did not see the need for a Jewish state in Palestine and did not want to exacerbate relations with the Arabs"....<font color="#FFCC00">John Quigley</font>: "Palestine and Israel: A Challenge to Justice."
<p>   The modern state of Israel is NOT comprised of the 
descendants of Abraham; in fact, they are primarily descendants of 
the Khazars whose ancestors are thought to be of Asian or Turkish 
origin.  The majority of immigrants came from Central and East Europe and USSR <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090209080930/http://www.hoffman-info.com/khazars.html"><font color="#FF0000">(Ashkenazi
Jews)</a></font><font color="#009900" size"5" size="5"> - click to read about - and after
World War II from all over the world. The forefathers of the new immigrants were not of
Semitic origin and never existed on the Palestinian Land and therefore have no claim for
Palestine (The Promised Land !). The term anti-Semitism makes no sense at all, for the Arabs are also Semites, so should hardly be accused of anti-Semitism. What the Palestinians could not understand or accept was why their land
had been chosen to deal with the age-old problem of anti-Jewish prejudice,
discrimination, persecution, and extermination in the Holocaust in Europe,
in the countries of Western, Central and Eastern Europe. What the Palestinians asked was, why are we being forced to pay the price
for this persecution of Jews in Europe? The easy answer is because the
Jewish national movement, Zionism, chose to establish its state in
Palestine, and the European powers concurred in that wish.
<p>  Only Sephardic Jews can claim that they probably descend from the Old Testament Semitic Hebrews.  And Sephardic Jews make up only a small minority and, more important, have a relatively low representation and influence within Jewish power structures, both in Israel and in the Diaspora.
<p>The greater part of Jews in Israel, as well as in the United States, Europe and Argentina are of mostly of Ashkenazim origin.
<p>Ashkenazim Jews � for the most part blond, light-eyed, white-skinned and often red-headed (those subscribing to M. de Gobineau�s out-dated theories would call them true �Aryans�, no doubt) � have little or nothing to do with the Hebrews and Israelites of the Bible.

It is a paradise for the rich and a total misery for lesser folk, including native Arab Muslims and Christians and even many Jews who do not belong to the Ashkenazim elite, but to �inferior� orders of Sephardic, Ethiopian, and Russian Jews.</font>

<p>   Britain's high commissioner for Palestine, John Chancellor, recommended total suspension of Jewish immigration and land purchase to protect Arab agriculture. He said: "all cultivable land was occupied; that no cultivable land now in possession of the indigenous population could be sold to Jews without creating a class of landless Arab cultivators..." The colonial office rejected the recommendation.

<p>The distortion of the intent and meaning of the Balfour Declaration caused the British to issue its "White Paper" in 1939. It stated emphatically and unequivocally: "His Majesty's Government believe that the framers of the Mandate in which the Balfour Declaration was embodied could not have intended that Palestine should be converted into a Jewish state against the will of the Arab population of the country. That Palestine was not to be converted into a Jewish state might be held to be implied in the passage from the Command Paper of 1922, which reads as follows..."  
<p> Acknowledging that the 1922 Whie Paper had not removed Arab doubts about Britain's policy, the 1939 White Paper then said:
<p><font color="#FF0000"> "His Majesty's Government therefore now declare unequivocally that it is not part of their policy that Palestine should become a Jewish state."</font> The Zionists rejected the "White Paper". 
<p align="center"><i><b>The Jews were growing in number with the help of Britain. Large
scale Jewish settlements began during the British Mandatory period and continued growing
in number. The World Zionist Organization and the Jewish Agency for Palestine raised funds
abroad and recruited Jewish immigration through the help and support from the Western
Governments. The prospect of a Jewish state, therefore, posed a mortal threat to the Palestinians, a prospect of ethnic subjugation and very likely of what is now called ethnic cleansing. As a result Arab opposition to British rule and to Zionism grew. Arab
uprising culminated in a general revolt (1936 - 39) and was suppressed by British troops
on the eve of World War II.</b> <i><b>
<p>In 1942 the Zionists began an all-out terrorist campaign intended to drive the British out of Palestine. The Terrorist campaign succeeded and caused the British to surrender its "League of Nations Mandate" over Palestine to the United Nations.</p>
<p>During World War II illegal Jewish immigration
increased and the Zionist movements started revolting against the British Mandate to take
over all Palestine. In 1947 Britain decided to leave Palestine and called on the UN to
make recommendations. The UN in Nov. 29, 1947 adopted a plan calling for partition of
Palestine into Arab and Jewish states "Partition
Plan". 
<p><center><img src="/web/20090209080930im_/http://geocities.com/zuhairhm/Zuhair/partitionplan.jpg">
<p>The plan suggested two separate independent sovereign states, one Jewish with a population of 450,000 and allotted 55 percent of the land and a Palestinian state, with a population of 1,300,000 allotted 45 percent of the land. The plan was more than fair
to the Jews then residing in Palestine but very unfair to the Arab
Palestinians, Christians and Muslims, then living there. The Jewish
population was approximately one-third of the total of inhabitants, and
the land then owned by Jews comprised about 6 percent of the total land area.
Yet the Partition Plan awarded about 55 percent of the territory to the
prospective Jewish state.  Thus it is not surprising that the Arabs rejected the plan,  and when Israel declared its independence in 1948 they invaded Palestine with military forces and tried to overturn the result.The partition plan was rejected by the Arabs and there
was full scale civil war.  The UN sent in a mediator, Count Folke Bernadotte, who in turn was assassinated by 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090209080930/http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/History/folke.html"><font color="#FF0000">Jewish terrorists.</a><i></font>
<p>The mastermind, the one who tatgeted Bernadotte and sanctioned his murder, was Stern Gang's director of operations, Yitzhak Shamir, who, when he emerged from the shadows many years later, would become Begin's foreign minister and then his successor as prime minister.
<p> Bernadotte's insistence that Israel had to allow the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes did not die with him. It was enshrined in another resolution of the UN General Assembly-number 194 of 11 adecember 1948. It was to become famous on account of Israel's contempt for it:
<p> "The General Assembly of the United Nations"<font color="#F0000"> Resolves</font> that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live in peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of, or damage to property which, under principles of international law or in equity, should be made good by the Governments or authorities responsible."
<p> For a particular purpose Israel said it would accept its obligations as set down in UN resolutions, including 194; but, as events were to prove, it had absolutely no intention of doing so.
  </b></p>
<p>The Zionist pressure on the White House and the United Nations is revealed in President Truman's Memoirs:
<p><font color="#FF0000"> "The facts were that not only were there pressure movements around the United Nations unlike anything that had been there before, but the White House too was subjected to a constant barrage. I do not think I ever had as much pressure and propaganda aimed at the White House as I had in this instance. The pressure of a few of the extreme Zionist leaders -<font color="#FFCC00"> actuated by political motives and engaging in political threats<font color="#FF0000"> - disturbed and annoyed me. Some were even suggesting that we pressure sovereign nations into favourable votes in the General Assembly. I have never approved of the practice of the strong imposing their will on the weak whether among men or among nations."</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">The way in which Jews built their power base in the American financial and then cultural and political spheres has been well documented by various American Historians. It is a process extending over decades since the late 19th century which includes the foundation of the Federal Reserve Board by agents of the great Rothschild and Warburg European dynasties (Schiff, Kuhn, Loeb etc...), the consolidation of the Hollywood industry under Jewish-led studios etc... </font>
<p>  "Most of the Zionist Movement accepted the partition resolution, convinced that the crucial issue was to establish a firm foundation for Jewish Sovereignty. In closed meetings, David Ben-Gurion never concealed his intention to expand at the first opportunity, the territory given to the Jews. That is why Israel's Declaration of Independence did not define the state's borders and Isreal has not defined its borders to this day.
<p>  The Arab World did not accept the Partition Plan and regarded it as a vile attempt by the United Nations, which at the time was essentially a club of Western and Communist Nations, to divide a country that did not belong to it. Handling over more than half of the country to the Jewish minority made it all the more unforgivable in their eyes."

This and the following massacres drove fear and panic into the Arab population, and led to the flight of unarmed civilians from their homes all over the country.

Most of these differences have increased rather than diminished with the evolution of Israel. That most North American Jews are fervent supporters of Israel does not trump the fact that Jews are, for the most part, members of other peoples: American Jews are Americans; Mexican Jews are Mexicans, and so on. They have rights of citizenship in their respective countries; they speak the language of those countries (most don't speak Hebrew or Yiddish); they are increasingly secular and, therefore, lack whatever bond religion might impart. They have no collective institutions, either political or cultural. They have no leaders. The rise of Israel has created not a Jewish people, but an ethnically diverse Israeli people, of whom 20 percent are non-Jewish. So, perhaps Zionists should not be too upset if one does not accept a politically viable right of the self-determination of peoples."
<p>Another quotation from the same book:
<p>"Zionists came thousands of miles (to Palestine), not merely to settle or immigrate, but to erect a Jewish state. The leaders literally conspired to dispossess or dominate the Palestinians. Though many Zionists ventured into Palestine with the ignorance and swagger of colonial adventures, and others arrived  dazzled by Utopian visions, all were engaged in a project that represented a moral threat to the indigenous inhabitants, who had done them no harm. Though some of those who constituted this threat were innocents, no adult Zionist can be said to have posed an innocent threat. They should have known better. They had a responsibility to know better. Zionism was no worse than many ethnic nationalisms nurtured by nineteenth-century European culture. But they were, all of them, a bad and dangerous idea. It was the implementation of this idea that made bloodshed in Palestine. That blood is on the Zionist's hands."

<p><font color="009900" size="5"> Qoute from Revilo P. Oliver's book "The Jewish Strategy:
<p>"...so far as we can tell, a distinct change has taken place in the Jews' activity in this century and at approximately the time of the 'Protocols.' Before this, the aliens seem to have been content to exploit the Aryans and, in biological terms, feed on them; the present objective is obviously extermination of our species through mongrelization and massacres, so that it would seem that the organization and domination of the Jewish colonies by the Zionists produced a change in purpose that must, to a large extent at least, have been consciously determined and planned."

<p>A quote from Rabbi Elmer Berger's "Prophecy, Zionism and the state of
Israel":
<p>
"The present State of Israel has no right whatsoever to claim the
accomplishment of the divine project for a Messianic age.... It is pure demagogy
of soil and blood."
<p><center>
Micah spells it out clearly : 
<p>"Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye
princes of the house of Israel that abhor judgment and pervert all equity. They
build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with inequity..."
<p><center><img src="/web/20090209080930im_/http://geocities.com/zuhairhm/Zuhair/bar3.gif">
<p>"The Palestinian uprising or intifada and the Israeli campaign to suppress it have caused considerable anguish for many Jews around the world. A large number of Jews have even begun to reassess their support for Israel and critically analyze the ideology of Zionism which legitimates the Jewish state. One example of this phenomenon is a statement that appeared in The Nation on February 3, 1988. It was endorsed by 18 prominent American Jews.
The advertisement called upon American Jews to "dissociate from Israel." It expressed the concern that "the close identification in the public mind between Israel and Jews -- an equation vigorously fostered by both the Zionist movement and the American Jewish lobby, which has come under its control -- threatens to stigmatize Jews everywhere." The ad called for a two-state solution and for negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
<font color="#CC0000">
The statement also discussed past discrimination against the Jews and the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust adding:
How tragic that in our own time the very state established by Jews in the aftermath of this evil has become a place where racialism, religious discrimination, militarism and injustice prevail; and that Israel itself has become a pariah state within the world community. Events taking place today are all too reminiscent of the pogroms from which our own forefathers fled two and three generations ago -- but this time those in authority are Jews and the victims are Muslims and Christian Palestinians." ...End of quote.</font> 
<p>In Nazi Germany they had an evil mantra called �the master race�, and here in Israel they have an equally diabolical one called the �chosen people�.
<p>In Nazi Germany, they had the Untermensch concept, and here in Israel they have the �goyim� whose rights and lives are expendable.
<p>"In Nazi Germany they had the idea of �Lebensraum�, and Israel they argue that �Jews have got to live somewhere,� a euphemism for stealing Palestinian land and expelling these helpless and powerless people from their ancestral homeland, all for the purpose of fulfilling Jewish nationalism, a nationalism that has more in common with Hitler�s Mein Kampf than with the Torah of Moses."

<p align="center"><b><i>During the Six Day War between Israel and the Arab States, the American intelligence ship USS Liberty was attacked for 75 minutes in international waters by Israeli aircraft and motor torpedo boats. Thirty-four men died and 171 were wounded. On August 9, 2001, the History Channel presented the long awaited program entitled "Cover Up: Attack on the U.S.S. Liberty."
<p>   The late George Ball, under secretary of state under President John
Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson and long-time Bilderberg luminary, expressed
outrage over the Israeli attack, James Akins, former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said. Ball wrote of the attack:
"Israel knew it could get away with anything." If Israel had succeeded
in sinking the ship with all aboard, the attack would have been blamed
on Egypt, Ball said. He referred to Israel "murdering Americans."
Getting an investigation is difficult, Akins said, because "Congress is
Israeli-occupied territory."
