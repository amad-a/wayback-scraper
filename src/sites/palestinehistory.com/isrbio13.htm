    <p>
      Dayan, (1915-1981), was an Israeli military man and political leader. He
      commanded the Israeli forces that won the Arab-Israeli war of 1956, and
      directed the Israeli victory in a six day war fought against Egypt,
      Jordan, and Syria in June 1967. Dayan became Israel's foreign minister in
      1977. He resigned in 1979 because he believed that the government was not
      doing enough to bring about peace with the Arabs. He was minister of
      defense from 1967 to 1974, minister of agriculture from 1959 to 1964, and
      chief of staff from 1953 to 1958.<br /><br />
      In 1939, the British who ruled Palestine imprisoned Dayan for his work
      with the outlawed Haganah, a Jewish terrorist militia group. He was
      released in 1941 to fight with the British against French. Dayan was
      wounded during a battle in Lebanon, and he lost his left eye. Dayan also
      took part in the first Arab-Israeli war of 1948. Dayan was born in
      Deganiya, Palestine.
