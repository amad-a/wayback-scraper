      In an attempt to break the power of the Lebanese Hizbollah organization,
      Israeli forces undertook a military operation against south Lebanon. The
      Israeli forces bombed the shelter which was providing refuge to
      approximately five hundred Lebanese, most of whom were children, elderly
      and women who had been forced out of their homes by Israeli raids on their
      villages, and who had been unable to get to Beirut.<br /><br />
      This bombing led to the deaths of 109 Lebanese civilians and seriously
      wounded 116 others. During the attack, Israeli forces used between 5 and 6
      advanced bombs designed to explode above their target in order to cause
      the largest possible number of casualties.<br /><br />
      International investigations confirmed that the Israeli forces had
      deliberately targeted the shelter.
