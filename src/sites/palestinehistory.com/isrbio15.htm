      Rabin, (1922-1995), was prime minister of Israel from 1974 to 1977 and
      from 1992 until his death. On Nov. 4, 1995, he was assassinated in Tel
      Aviv, Israel. A right-wing Israeli university student who opposed Rabin's
      policies confessed to the murder.<br /><br />
      Rabin was born in Jerusalem and was the nation's first prime minister born
      in Israel. Israel's previous prime ministers were born in Europe. In 1941,
      during World War II, Rabin joined the Palmach, a unit of the Jewish
      underground terrorist army in Palestine. He was deputy commander of the
      Palmach in 1948 during the first Arab-Israeli war. Rabin headed Israel's
      defense forces from 1964 to 1967. He planned the strategy in a 1967 war in
      which the Israelis defeated the Arabs and occupied the Arab lands of the
      Gaza Strip and West Bank.<br /><br />
      From 1968 to 1973, Rabin was ambassador to the United States. A Labor
      Party member, he was elected to Israel's parliament in 1973. He became
      Labor Party head and prime minister in 1974, and held those posts until
      1977. He was minister of defense from 1984 to 1990.<br /><br />
      Rabin again became Labor Party head in February 1992. Elections in June
      brought the party to power, and Rabin became prime minister again. He
      appointed himself minister of defense. In 1993, Rabin's government and the
      Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed an agreement that included
      the start of a plan for self-government for, and Israel's withdrawal from,
      the Gaza Strip and West Bank. Israel and the PLO also agreed to try to
      work out their conflicts. Rabin, Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres,
      and PLO leader Yasser Arafat shared the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize for their
      peace efforts. Also in 1994, talks between Rabin and King Hussein I of
      Jordan led to a peace treaty ending a state of war that had technically
      existed between their countries since 1948.
