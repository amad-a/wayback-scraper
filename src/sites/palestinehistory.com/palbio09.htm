      Also called AL-HAJJ AMIN (born 1897, Jerusalem, Palestine, - d. July 4,
      1974, Beirut, Lebanon), Mufti of Jerusalem and Arab nationalist figure who
      played a major role in Arab resistance to Zionist political ambitions in
      Palestine.<br /><br />
      Husayni studied in Jerusalem, Cairo, and Istanbul, and in 1910 he was
      commissioned in the Turkish artillery. He became a strong voice in the
      Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist movements. In Jan 1922 the British, who
      had accepted a mandate for Palestine after World War I, named Husayni
      permanent president and mufti of the newly created Supreme Muslim Council
      the most authoritative religious body in the Palestinian Muslim
      community.<br /><br />
      In 1936 all the Palestinian groups joined to create a permanent executive
      organ known as the Arab High Committee under Husayni's chairmanship. The
      committee demanded a cessation of Jewish immigration and a prohibition of
      land transfers from Arabs to Jews. A general strike developed into a
      rebellion against British authority. The British removed Husayni from the
      council presidency and declared the committee illegal in Palestine. In
      October 1937 he fled to Lebanon, where he reconstituted the committee
      under his domination.<br /><br />
      The rebellion forced Britain to make substantial concessions to Arab
      demands in 1939. The British abandoned the idea of establishing Palestine
      as a Jewish state, and, while Jewish immigration was to continue for
      another five years, it was thereafter to depend on Arab consent. Husayni,
      however, felt that the concessions did not go far enough, and he
      repudiated the new policy.<br /><br />
      Ceasing to play an active role in Palestinian affairs, Husayni spent most
      of World War II (1939-45) in Germany. At the war's end he fled to Egypt.
