      Meir, Golda (1898-1978), served as prime minister of Israel from 1969 to
      1974. During her political career, she supported large-scale immigration
      to Israel and major housing and other construction programs. Her main
      problem as prime minister was the territorial conflict between Israel and
      several Arab nations. Meir followed a firm but open policy toward the
      Arabs.<br /><br />
      In October 1973, war broke out for the fourth time between Israel and the
      Arabs. Israel suffered heavy early losses, and Meir's government was
      severely criticized. As a result, she resigned in June 1974, even though
      she had led the Labor Party to victory in the December 1973 elections.<br /><br />
      Golda Meir was born Golda Mabovitz in Kiev, Ukraine. Her family moved to
      Milwaukee in 1906, and she later taught school there. In 1921, she went to
      Palestine and joined a collective farm village.<br /><br />
      In 1948, part of Palestine occupied by Jewish and became Israel. Meir
      served as Israel's minister of labor from 1949 to 1956 and as minister of
      foreign affairs from 1956 to 1966. She was secretary general of the Labor
      Party from 1966 to 1969.
