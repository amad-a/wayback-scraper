      This Flash show has been widely distributed though the Internet to show
      (as they claim) the difference between the Dome of the Rock (Qubbet
      es-Sakhrah) and the Al-Aqsa Mosque. In this Flash there is number of
      historical and geographical errors which give major concern about the real
      purpose of this program. These mistakes will give totally different images
      about the truth, and may in some other ways, prove the FALSITY of Israeli
      and Jewish claims to Al-Qouds and the Western Wall of Al-Aqsa Mosque.<br /><br />
      Here are some examples of the mistakes I found in this Flash show: -<br /><br />
      1. The orientation of the image is not correct. Where the Al-Aqsa Mosque
      building is, in reality, on the Western side, it is, instead shown to be
      on the Southern side in this image. This is very important since we have
      to use these directions to show the place of the Jewish claimed Western
      Wall.<br /><br />
      2. There is also a discrepancy with the Western Wall or Al-Bouraq wall
      (Jews claim it as the Wailing Wall and the only remnant of Solomon's
      Temple). The location of this important wall in this flash image is shown
      to be behind the Al-Aqsa Mosque building ( or, to the South of Al-Aqsa
      mosque haram), while in reality, it should be to the West side (or, in
      this image the left side )of Al-Aqsa Mosque walls and, therefore, BEHIND
      the Dome of the Rock on the same side of "Huta Gate". The location on the
      map are remments of an Islamic Khalifa's Palace behind the Al-Aqsa
      Mosque.<br /><br />
      3. The Jewish sector of the city is not correct. After the 1967 war,
      Jewish forces took control of "Harat Al-Magarba" which contains the
      Western Wall. This area is not included in the Jewish section and is
      unedited.<br /><br />
      4. It also makes reference that the Jewish sector is cleaner and more
      modern than the Arab sector. (?)<br /><br />
      5. The Holy Sepulcher is also in the wrong position since that place
      identified in the program as the Holy Sepulcher is just a small part of
      the Christian sector of Jerusalem. The Holy Sepulcher, in reality, is in
      the center of this area.<br /><br />
      6. They said that the Al-Aqsa Mosque was built by Adam and later completed
      by Prophets Solomon and David (Suleimon and Dahood). Never has it been
      stated in any reference material that Solomon or David had anything to do
      with Al-Aqsa Mosque. They had built a temple somewhere in Al-Qouds but it
      is not at all this building. It is well known that Khalifa Omar was the
      one who rebuilt the Mosque (after opening the City of Jerusalem in the
      year 638).<br /><br />
      7. The program said that Prophet Mosa entered Al-Aqsa Mosque from Huta
      Gate. This is totally not true since Prophet Mosa passed away on the way
      to Palestine before reaching Jericho. He was buried on the way to Jericho
      in a remote desert place, never having made it to Jericho and never having
      entered Al-Qouds. This is an historical fact also accepted by Jewish
      believers.<br /><br />
      8. As for the Arab sector, this flash program states that it has been left
      to Arabs to live in it. Arab Muslims and Christians, both, were living in
      Al-Qouds for over thousands of years.<br /><br />
      All are requested to clarify such facts to their friends and please stop
      forwarding such programs to others since it will demolish what we are
      trying to build.<br /><br />
      If someone can correctly edit the above Flash program, it will definitely
      be considered excellent work.<br /><br />
