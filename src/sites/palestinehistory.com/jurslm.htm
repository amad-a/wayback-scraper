      Jerusalem (Arabic al-Quds) largest city in the West Bank , situated
      between the Mediterranean Sea and the Dead Sea . Jerusalem is a holy city
      for the world's major religions: Islam, and Christianity . In 1948
      Jerusalem was under Israel occupation (West Jerusalem) , and Jordan
      controlled the other part of Jerusalem (East Jerusalem) including the Old
      City. In 1967 Israel occupied East Jerusalem in the Six-Day War, Since
      then , both west and east Jerusalem has been under Israeli occupation.<br /><br />
      Points of Interest Jerusalem's Old City is divided into Muslim, Armenian,
      Christian and Jewish sections and is enclosed by walls with gates . The
      Christian section , in the northwest, contains the New Gate, shares the
      Jaffa Gate with the Armenian section on the southwest, and the Damascus
      Gate with the Muslim section on the north. The Muslim section, in the
      northeastern portion of the Old City , contains Herod's Gate, Saint
      Stephen's Gate, and the Golden Gate , east of which is located the Mount
      of Olives and the garden of Gethsemane.<br /><br />
      The Jewish section, occupying the southeastern portion, contains the Zion
      Gate , south of which is Mount Zion was created in place of an Islamic
      area called Harat Al-Shurafa (or Harat al-Magarbah) after the Israeli
      occupation in 1967 (all the houses and the building in Harat al-Magarbah
      were deomlished by Israeli forces and new houses for Jeiwsh setllers were
      build). It also contains Dung Gate. Around the Old City is the New City,
      developed since the middle of the 19th century. The population of
      Jerusalem (1990 estimate) is 524,500.<br /><br />
      The Old City is sacred to Christians as the site where Jesus Christ spent
      his last days on earth, and it is sacred to Muslims as the site of the
      ascent into heaven of the Prophet Muhammad. Notable structures include the
      Christian Church of the Holy Sepulcher, built over the 4th-century , the
      Muslim Dome of the Rock, built upon the site where Muhammad have ascended
      to heaven , the Mosque of Al Aqsa one of Islam's most sacred shrines; and
      the Citadel, a 14th-century structure on the site of Herod's fortress.
