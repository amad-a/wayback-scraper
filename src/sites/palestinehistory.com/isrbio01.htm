    <center>Theodor Herzl , Founder of Zionism</center>
    <p>
      Political movement advocating the establishment of a Jewish homeland in
      Palestine, the �promised land� of the Bible.<br /><br />
      1896 As a response to European anti-Semitism, Theodor Herzl published his
      Jewish State, outlining a scheme for setting up an autonomous Jewish
      commonwealth .<br /><br />
      1897 The World Zionist Congress was established in Basel, Switzerland,
      with Herzl as its first president. �Hatikva� (The Hope) was adopted as the
      Zionist anthem, which was the unofficial anthem of Israel until 1948 when
      it was sung at the proclamation of the State of Israel on May 14.<br /><br />
      1917 The Balfour Declaration was secured from Britain by Chaim Weizmann.
      It promised the Jews a homeland in Palestine.<br /><br />
      1940-48 Jewish settlement in the British mandate of Palestine led to armed
      conflict between militant Zionists Irgun and Stern Gang and both
      Palestinian Arabs and the British.<br /><br />
      1947 In Nov the United Nations (UN) issued a resolution in order to
      divided Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem as an
      international city.<br /><br />
      1948 The Jews in Palestine proclaimed the State of Israel on May 14, but
      the Arab states rejected both the partition of Palestine and the existence
      of Israel. The armies of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Trans-Jordan, Saudi Arabia,
      Yemen, and Egypt crossed Palestine borders and attacked but were defeated
      by the Israeli army (Haganah).<br /><br />
      1975 The General Assembly of the UN condemned Zionism as �a form of racism
      and racial discrimination�; among those voting against the resolution were
      the USA and the members of the European Community (now the European
      Union).
