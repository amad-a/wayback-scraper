      US secretary of state (1973-6) and academic. His family emigrated to the
      USA in 1938 , Jew . He studied at Harvard, and after war service worked
      for a number of public agencies before joining the Harvard faculty
      (1962-71). He became President Nixon's adviser on national security
      affairs in 1969, was the main American figure in the negotiations to end
      the Vietnam War (for which he shared the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize), and as
      secretary of state served under Nixon and Ford. His 'shuttle diplomacy'
      was aimed at bringing about peace between Israel and the Arab states, and
      resulted in a notable improvement in Israeli-Egyptian relations. After
      leaving public office (1977), he became professor of diplomacy at
      Georgetown, and established Kissinger Associates, a consulting firm. His
      book Diplomacy was published in 1994.
