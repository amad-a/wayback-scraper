<center><font size="+1" color="Blue"><b> Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) </b></font></center><br>
<p>The first elected Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) was initially
conceptualized with the Declaration of Principles (DOP). The idea was
further developed in the Israel-Palestinian Interim Agreement (Oslo II) in
which the structure, jurisdiction, functions, size, and responsibilities of
the Council were determined.<br><br>
The PLC, is to replace the Palestinian Authority upon it inauguration. As
such, the Council is expected to act as the highest authority in the
interim phase. The PLC is the body responsible for legislation and from it
the majority (80% of the cabinet) of the Executive Authority is appointed.</p><br>

<center><font size="+1" color="Blue"><b> Committees of the Council </b></font></center><br>
<p>The Council established eleven permanent committees at its second meeting
on April 4, 1996. Under Title III of the Standing Rules, the committees
review and propose amendments to legislation, report to the Council,
receive constituent complaints, and study and review plans, programs,
agreements, and treaties submitted to the Council by the Executive
Authority. The committees discuss and report to the Council on any
proposals referred by the Council or by the Speaker. The committees usually
meet twice a week and may hold additional meetings at the call of the
chairman, or by request of the Speaker or a majority of the members of the
committee, with at least 24 hours notice. The committees meet in secret but
can decide to hold public meetings. The quorum for a committee meeting is a
majority of its members and decisions of the committees require a simple
majority. Each committee has a chairman and a secretary elected from among
its members. A committee may request, through the Speaker, that any
relevant Minister or responsible person within the Palestinian National
Authority give information or clarify any issue within the committee�s
mandate. A committee may also ask the Speaker to request, through the
President of the Authority, the attendance of any relevant Minister at a
committee meeting.</p><br>
