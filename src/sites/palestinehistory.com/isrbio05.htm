      Several Jewish groups had been linked with terrorist attacks against Arabs
      and British in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The best known of these
      organizations, the Gush Emunim Underground (sometimes called the Jewish
      Terror Organization), was formed in 1979 by prominent members of Gush
      Emunim, a group of religious zealots who had used squatter tactics to
      carry on a terrorist campaign to settle the West Bank after the October
      1973 War. The underground perceived the 1978 Camp David Accords and the
      1979 Treaty of Peace Between Egypt and Israel as betraying the Begin
      government's policy of retaining the territories conquered by Israel.<br /><br />
      The principal terrorist actions of the Gush Emunim Underground were
      carried out between 1980 and 1984. In 1980 car bombings of five West Bank
      Arab mayors resulted in crippling two of the mayors. In 1983, the Hebron
      Islamic College was the target of a machine gun and grenade attack that
      killed three Arab students and wounded thirty three others. In 1984 an
      attempt was made to place explosive charges on five Arab buses in East
      Jerusalem. This plot was foiled by agents of Israel's internal security
      force, Shin Bet, leading to arrest and prison sentences for eighteen
      members of the underground. The security services also uncovered a
      well-developed plan to blow up the Dome of the Rock, one of Islam's most
      sacred shrines, on Al-Aqsa Mosque complex in east Jerusalem's.
