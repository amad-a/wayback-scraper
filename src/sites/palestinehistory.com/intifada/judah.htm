      Jewish settlers burn Palestinian to death<br /><br />
      Jewish settlers abducted a Palestinian farmer Isam Judah Mustafa Hamed
      from his olive orchard, took him to their nearby settlement, bludgeoned
      him to death with clubs and axes and then set his mutilated body on
      fire.<br /><br />
      The settlers, armed with Uzi submachine guns, abducted Isam Judah Mustafa
      Hamed, 42 Years old , in early morning hours Monday 09.10.2000 while
      picking olive on his olive orchard at the village of Um Saffa near
      Ramalla. They forced him into an awaiting car at gun point.<br /><br />
      At 10 o'clock , villagers found his charred and mutilated body dumped at
      the roadside.<br /><br />
      This one of the most shocking attack by Israeli settlers and Israeli army
      . The body, as per number of doctors and as per next photos, is burnt and
      bearing signs of torture including extensive burn marks on his face . Isam
      Judah , murder seems to have been the latest in a long and ugly history of
      attacks by settlers against innocent Palestinians.<br /><br />
      On October 10, 2000 , Palestinians pray in a central Ramallah mosque over
      the body of Isam Judah during his funeral . After Judah's funeral several
      hundred Palestinians confronted Israeli troops on the outskirts of this
      West Bank town and held running stone-throwing battles for several hours.
