    <p>
      Resolution adopted unanimously in December 1948 by the United Nations
      General Assembly. The objective of the 30-article declaration is to
      promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
      The declaration proclaims the personal, civil, political, economic,
      social, and cultural rights of humans, which are limited only by
      recognition for the rights and freedoms of others and the requirements of
      morality, public order, and general welfare. Among the rights cited by the
      declaration are the rights to life, liberty, and security of person; to
      freedom from arbitrary arrest; to a fair trial; to be presumed innocent
      until proved guilty; to freedom from interference with the privacy of
      one's home and correspondence; to freedom of movement and residence; to
      asylum, nationality, and ownership of property; to freedom of thought,
      conscience, religion, opinion, and expression; to association, peaceful
      assembly, and participation in government; to social security,<br /><br />
      The General Assembly in 1955 authorized two human rights covenants, one
      relating to civil and political rights, and the other to economic, social,
      and cultural rights. After a long struggle for ratification, both of these
      covenants became effective in January 1976.
