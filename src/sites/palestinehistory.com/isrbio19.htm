      Ehud "Brug" Barak is Israel's most highly decorated soldier . Barak was
      born in 1942 in Kibbutz Mishmar Hasharon. He earned a bachelor's degree in
      physics and mathematics from Hebrew University in Jerusalem and a masters
      degree in economic-engineering systems from Stanford University.<br /><br />
      He was drafted into the Israel Defense Forces in 1959. Barak served as a
      commander in many of Israel's wars, including the 1967 Six Day War and the
      1973 October War. In 1991, he became the 14th chief of the General Staff
      and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general, the highest in the
      Israeli military. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and four
      other citations for bravery and excellence.<br /><br />
      A hallmark of Barak's military career was his involvement in the political
      process. He helped finalize the 1994 peace treaty with Jordan and also
      played a key role in Syrian-Israeli negotiations. Barak was critical of
      the Oslo talks but has argued that Israel should keep moving forward in a
      realistic manner on the path to peace.<br /><br />
      In 1995, Barak left the military and joined the government of Yitzhak
      Rabin as minister of the interior. Before his appointment, he was accused
      of deserting wounded soldiers during a secret military exercise in 1992.
      An investigation exonerated him from the allegations of misconduct.<br /><br />
      After Rabin was assassinated, Barak was appointed foreign minister in the
      administration of Shimon Peres.<br /><br />
      Barak was elected Labor leader in 1997, Barak's leadership solidified
      after the Knesset called for early elections.
