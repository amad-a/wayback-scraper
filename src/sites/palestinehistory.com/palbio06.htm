      Interim governing body appointed July 1994 to take over the management of
      Palestinian affairs from Israel in newly liberated Gaza Strip and Jericho
      . It is headed by Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
      organization. The PNA has jurisdiction over the whole of the formerly
      occupied areas, except Israeli settlers and nationals , Israel retains
      responsibility for external defence and foreign affairs.<br /><br />
      On 5 Dec 1994 Israel extended the PNA's remit to include administration of
      health and collection of taxes. In the same month , the Israeli parliament
      passed legislation allowing for the closure of PNA offices set up outside
      the self-rule areas, notably Orient House in East Jerusalem.<br /><br />
      Since taking office, the PNA has had to contend with militant attacks by
      Palestinian islamic groups within area of jurisdiction , directed at
      Israeli soldiers .
