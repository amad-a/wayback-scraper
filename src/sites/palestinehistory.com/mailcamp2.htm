        Text of the message<br /><br />

        Mister President, we strongly appeal to you in the name of humanity and
        civil human rights as a leader of the free world, to order the Israeli
        Government for an immediate and obligatory ending of their illegal
        occupation on the Palestinian lands, the Israeli army day to day
        violation of unarmed civilians human rights, their acts against the
        medical staff and the International medical support organizations which
        prohibit them in doing their civilian duties and the Israel blocking on
        the free press and media in a fair and actual cover of the recent
        aggression in the Palestinian lands in West Bank and Gaza Strip.<br /><br />
        Mister President, we strongly appeal to you to support the rights of the
        Palestinian nation and to immediately interfere to stop the growing
        chances of a true human disaster on the medical, social and political
        levels which endanger the chances of PEACE in the future and lead the
        area for more tension and a wider conflict. The people of this lands has
        the right to live in peace and to enjoy their human and political rights
        in a fair and equal level with other people around the world.<br /><br />
        Mister President, the Palestinian nation is not an immigrants or foreign
        people, they are the original inhabitants of this land since thousands
        of years. Therefore, the Palestinian nation has the legal, human, civil
        and legitimate rights to defend their own existence, lands, properties
        and their nationhood similar to any other nation under illegal military
        occupation in other parts of the world, using all legitimate methods to
        defend themselves. Remember Mister President, that all Arab Nations
        selected the peace and the last proof is the Latest Arab Peace
        Proposal.<br /><br />
        We demand that you have your own Peace Proposal based on the United
        Nation and International Law to force Israel to accept the Arab Peace
        Proposal and to implement it on a fixed, short-term and compulsory
        schedule under supervision of independent international monitoring and
        control. <br /><br />
        Millions of free people around the world are appealing to you to stand
        side by side of the innocent people of Palestine and to stop the ethnic
        cleansing war ongoing by the Israel army against them for the last
        days.<br /><br />
