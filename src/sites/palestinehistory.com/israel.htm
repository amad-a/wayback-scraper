      The Zionist movement, calling for an independent community for Jews in
      Palestine , began in the 19th century, and in 1917 Britain declared its
      support for the idea . In 1920 the League of Nations placed Palestine
      under British administration , and the British government was immediately
      faced with the rival claims of Jews who wished to settle there and the
      Arabs who opposed them. In 1937 Britain proposed separate Arab and Jewish
      communities ; this was accepted by the Jews but not by the Arabs, and
      fighting broke out between them.

      In 1947 the British plan for partition was supported by United Nations,
      and when Britain ended its Palestinian mandate 1948, an Israel was
      proclaimed , with David Ben-Gurion as prime minister. Neighbouring Arab
      states sent forces to crush Israel but failed, and when a cease-fire
      agreement was reached 1949, Israel controlled more land than had been
      originally allocated to it. The remaning of Palestine, known as the West
      Bank, was controled by Jordan, and Gaza Strip wa controled by Egypt.<br /><br />
      The creation of Israel encouraged Jewish immigration on a large scale ,
      about 2 million having arrived from all over the world by 1962 . Hundreds
      of thousands of Arab residents fled from Israel to neighbouring countries,
      such as Jordan and Lebanon. In 1964 a number of Palestinian Arabs in exile
      founded the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), aiming to overthrow
      Israel.
