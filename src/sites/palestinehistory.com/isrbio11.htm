      Helped found Israel and served as prime minister from 1963 until his
      death. Eshkol was a capable administrator, political leader, and statesman
      who served in such posts as director of the ministry of defense, minister
      of agriculture, and minister of finance. While he was prime minister,
      Israel fought the Six Day War against the Arab states in 1967. Eshkol
      favored Israeli cooperation with Arab states to develop the Middle
      East.<br /><br />
      Eshkol was born Levi Shkolnik in Ukraine. He joined the Zionist movement
      as a young man. In 1914, he moved to Palestine and worked as a farmer. He
      helped form the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor) in 1920 and the
      Mapai (Israel Workers Party) in 1930. In the 1930's, he helped Jews in
      Germany move to Palestine. He helped build up the Haganah, the Jewish
      underground terrorist organization that fought against British mandate
      forces and against Palestinian Arabs opposed to the formation of a Jewish
      state in Palestine .
