      West Bank, territory in southwestern Asia, in the Middle East, located
      west of the Jordan River, occupied by Israel since 1967 . It covers an
      area of about 5879 sq km and supports a population of about 973,500. All
      of the people are Palestinian Arabs. There is some Jews who have settled
      in the area since 1967. The West Bank was part of the British League of
      Nations Palestine mandate from 1922 to 1948, after the first Arab Israeli
      war in 1948 , Jordan took control of the region in 1949 . In 1967 the area
      was seized by Israel during the Six Day War.<br /><br />
      Under accords reached in the late 1970s between Egypt and Israel, the
      latter agreed to give the Palestinians of the West Bank more self rule ,
      but subsequent negotiations failed to determine what the exact nature of
      government in the territory would be.<br /><br />
      Beginning in December 1987, Intifada started in West Bank and Gaza Strip
      demanding Palestinian autonomy in Palestinian lands occupied by Israel .
      In November 1988 the PLO proclaimed a Palestinian state that included the
      West Bank and Gaza Strip based on UN resolution no 242 and other UN
      resolution related the Arab Israeli conflict.<br /><br />
      After decades of violence between Arabs and Israeli in the West Bank,
      leaders of the PLO and Israel agreed to the signing of an historic peace
      treaty . On September 13, 1993, PLO leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli prime
      minister Yitzhak Rabin met in the United States for the signing of the
      accord, which pledged to establish limited Palestinian self rule,
      beginning with the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho . In May
      1994 Israeli troops left Jericho, and a Palestinian authority took control
      of the city.
