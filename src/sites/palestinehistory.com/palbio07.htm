      Palestinian uprising, Most of the Palestinians people active between 1987
      to 1993 in attacks on armed Israeli troops in the occupied territories of
      Palestine. Their campaign for self-determination included stone throwing
      and petrol bombing.<br /><br />
      The uprising began Dec 1987 in the Gaza Strip. Rumors that a fatal
      deliberated traffic collision had been caused by Israeli security service
      agents in retaliation for the stabbing of an Israeli the previous week led
      to demonstrations by teenagers armed with slingshots. It subsequently
      spread, despite attempts at repression. Some 1,300 Palestinians were
      Martyred and 80 Israelis were killed in the uprising up to the end of
      1991. Many Palestinian private homes were dynamited by military order,
      under a still-valid British emergency regulation of 1946 . The number of
      soldiers on duty on the West Bank at the beginning of 1989 was said to be
      more than three times the number needed to conquer it during the Six Day
      War.<br /><br />
      The 1993 peace accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
      Organization effectively liberated the occupied territories of Gaza and
      Jericho. However , Islamic groups that had participated in the Intifada,
      notably the militant wing of the Hamas islamic group, opposed the accord
      and continued a campaign of attacks within Israel.
