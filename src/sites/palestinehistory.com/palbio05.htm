      Islamic organization , Founded on August 1988 . Its militant wing, Izz
      al-Din al-Qassam unit, played a major role in the Intifada, the
      Palestinian uprising in the Israeli occupied territories. Responsible for
      attacks on Israeli soldiers , the group gained a reputation for
      unpredictability. It opposed the Sept 1993 peace accord between Israel and
      the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and maintained a campaign of
      attacks within Israel .<br /><br />
      In Nov 1992 Hamas formed an alliance with Iran for support in the
      continuation of the Intifada. In Dec 1992, 415 Palestinians suspected of
      having links with Hamas were expelled from Israel in to Lebanon. Refused
      refugee status by Lebanon and neighboring Arab states , they remained for
      six months in a on Marj al-Zahour, a mountain slope camp until
      international condemnation of the deportations forced Israel to agree to
      their return.<br /><br />
      Its militant wing, Al Qassam, claimed responsibility for two bomb attacks
      within Israel April 1994 , in which 12 died, and for a further bus bombing
      in Tel Aviv Oct 1994, in which 21 Israelis and 1 Dutch national were
      killed. All were carried out by martyr bombers. In Nov 1994 there were
      clashes between supporters of Hamas and Palestinian police in newly
      liberated Gaza, the police shot 16 of them outside the Palestine Mosque in
      Gaza ('Black Friday')..<br /><br />
      In 1989 Hamas leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, was arrested by the Israelis
      and sentenced to life imprisonment for ordering the killing of
      Palestinians who had allegedly collaborated with the Israeli army. he's
      been released on 1 October 1997, in a trade off with Jordan for 2 Israeli
      agents.
