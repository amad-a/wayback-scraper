    <center>Al-Wazir, Khalil Ibrahim (ABU JIHAD)</center>
    <p>
      By name ABU JIHAD (born Oct. 10, 1935, Ramla, Palestine -d. April 16,
      1988, Tunis, Tunisia), Palestinian leader who was believed to be the
      military strategist and second in command of the Palestine Liberation
      Organization (PLO).<br /><br />
      Palestine's most loyal sons and one of the Palestinian Revolution's
      historical leaders, Khalil al-Wazir (Abu Jihad), He was assassinated by
      Zionist commandos, in Tunis, Tunisia. At the time of his assassination Abu
      Jihad was working late in his office. He refused to surrender to his
      assassins. After a brief exchange of fire Abu Jihad, the mastermind behind
      the Savoy Operation in 1975 and Dalal al-Mughrabi's operation on the raod
      between Tel Aviv and Haifa in March of 1978, fell with his gun in his
      hand. It was reported later that his body was riddled with 77 bullets.<br /><br />
      Abu Jihad was born in Ramla in 1935. He was displaced in 1948 when Zionist
      forces evicted Palestinians from that region. He settled in the Burayj
      refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, where he completed his secondary
      education. He planned and executed military acts against Israeli targets
      and in 1954 was punished by the Egyptian authorities for such activities.
      Al-Wazir received his military traning in Cairo while attending classes at
      the University of Alexandria in 1956 but never completed college education
      Abu Jihad found work in Kuwait in 1959 and remained there, working as a
      teacher, until 1963. His stay in Kuwait put him in touch with his comrades
      with whom he founded the FATEH movement. Al-Wazir was one of the early
      full-time (mutafarrigh) members of Fatah after the Fatah Central Committee
      instructed him to open an office for the movement in Algeria. He was also
      one of the founding editors of Filastinuna, the official organ of Fatah.
      He was in charge of the recruitment and training of Fatah fighters,
      creating the nucleus of the fighting force of Fatah, later known as
      AL-ASIFA, The Storm. Al-Wazir settled in Algeria in 1963 and cultivated
      ties with military leaders in socialist countries. He opened the first
      office for Fatah in an Arab country and started the first military
      training camp for his movement. He visited China in 1964 and later
      preached "a people's liberation war," although he never supported
      communism as an ideology .He also visited North Vietnam and North Korea,
      here he received advanced military education.<br /><br />
      In 1965, Abu Jihad settled in Damascus, taking advantage of the Syrian
      Ba'thist regime's support of the doctrine of people's liberation war. He
      became the major link between underground activist cells inside Occupied
      Palestine and the Palestinian national movement. The 1967 defeat propelled
      him into a key leadership position with the PLO, made possible by his
      reputation as an expert on people's liberation war, considered the only
      solution at the time. He assumed major responsibilities in the Central
      Committee of Fatah, in the command of the forces of al-Asifa, on the
      PALESTINE NATIONAL COUNCIL, and on the Supreme Military Council of the
      PLO. He was also put in charge of commando operations in the Occupied
      Territories and inside Israel. Abu Jihad played an important military role
      in JORDAN in 1970-71 during the BLACK SEPTEMBER clashes, He also supplied
      the encircled Palestinian forces in Jarash and Ajlun. Then, like other PLO
      leaders, he relocated to Beirut, where he kept a low profile until the
      eruption of the Lebanese civil war. He advocated a policy of full support
      for the Lebanese national movement and helped build up the forces of the
      PLO's Lebanese allies. Meanwhile, his main interest remained with the
      Occupied Territories; more than any other person inside the PLO and Fatah,
      Abu Jihad is credited with the development of underground cells in the
      WEST BANK and Gaza despite Israeli attempts to eradicate all vestiges of
      opposition to the occupation. Abu Jihad used his contacts with communist
      countries to augment the military power of the PLO. The resulting arms
      acquisition changed the PLO's fighting forces into a conventional army,
      rather than the "people's liberation forces" on which he had earlier
      insisted. Nevertheless, Abu Jihad remained close to his fighters; avoiding
      the lure of Beirut, he established his headquarters in Kayfun, near Alayh
      in Mount Lebanon.<br /><br />
      Unlike other PLO leaders, Abu Jihad did not allow the Lebanese environment
      to discredit his role within the movement; he was never tainted by the
      massive corruption and thuggery that swept the ranks of PLO officials.
      Although he was less visible than most of his comrades, he commanded the
      respect and loyalty of most Palestinians, including members of rival
      organizations. His close relationship with Yasir Arafat was greatly to
      Arafat's benefit, since Arafat was being constantly challenged from within
      over his search for a diplomatic solution to the Palestinian problem.<br /><br />
      The 1982 invasion of Lebanon by the Zionist forces forced Abu Jihad, along
      with other PLO leaders, to relocate farther away from Palestine, this time
      in Tunisia.<br /><br />
      The 1982 invasion of Lebanon seemed to have changed Abu Jihad's political
      and military philosophy; apparently, he lost faith in the PLO's ability to
      deliver a solution to the Palestinians from outside the Occupied
      Territories. Instead, he believed in the power of the masses in the West
      Bank and Gaza. In 1982, he began to sponsor youth committees in the
      Occupied Territories, committees that became the embryonic organization
      that later ignited the INTIFADA. However, Abu Jihad did not live long
      enough to see that uprising; he was assassinated by Israeli commandos in
      April 1988.
