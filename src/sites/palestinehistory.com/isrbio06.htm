    <p>
      Another anti-Arab terrorist group, Terror Against Terror (known as TNT)
      was established by Kach, the right-wing extremist political movement of
      Rabbi Meir Kahane. TNT was responsible for numerous beatings and bombings
      and several murders of Arabs, beginning in 1975. Defending Shield (Egrof
      Magen), a Jewish vigilante group of West Bank settlers formed in 1983, was
      responsible for a number of attacks and vandalizing of Arab property on
      the West Bank. During the intifadah, beginning in late 1987, there were
      many reports of Jewish vigilantism, including shootings, punitive raids on
      refugee camps, and assaults on Arab motorists in retaliation for rock
      throwing attacks by Arab youths. Most of these appeared to be spontaneous
      actions by settlers of individual communities.
