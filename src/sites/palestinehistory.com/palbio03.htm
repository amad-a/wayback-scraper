      (PFLP), Arabic AL-JABHA AL-SHA'BIYAH LI-TAHRIR FILAsTIN , It was
      established in 1967 in an amalgamation of three different Palestinian
      guerrilla groups by Georges Habash . The PFLP suffered from conflicts
      between its several factions, though all were engaged in guerrilla
      activities. The PFLP rejected political compromise with Israel and was
      pledged to the elimination of that state. It took a vigorously
      anti-western and anti capitalist stance on other Middle Eastern
      questions.<br /><br />
      The PFLP carried out or organized many notorious guerrilla actions against
      Israel, most notably the hijacking and destruction of airliners to Israel
      in the late 1960s and '70s.<br />
