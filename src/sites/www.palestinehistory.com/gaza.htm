<p>Gaza, (Arabic Ghazze), city and port near the Mediterranean Sea, about 32
km north of the Egyptian border. This ancient city has given its name to
the Gaza Strip , a territory that was occupied by Israeli forces from 1967
until 1994. The Gaza Strip covers about 378 sq km (about 146 sq mi) and
extends northeast from the Sinai Peninsula along the Mediterranean for
about 40 km (about 25 mi).<br><br>
Gaza was an important city in the 15th century BC , when the Egyptian king
Thutmose III made it a base for his army in a war with Syria . In biblical
times Gaza was one of the five royal cities of the ancient Philistines .<br><br>
In the 8th century BC it was conquered by the Assyrians; from the 3rd to
the 1st century BC , Egyptian , Syrian , and Hebrew armies fought for its
possession . During Roman occupation it was called Minoa .<br><br>
In the 7th century AD it became a sacred Muslim city, but the Crusaders
found it almost deserted in the 12th century . Gaza fell to the French
general Napoleon Bonaparte during his Egyptian campaign .<br><br>
In 1917 , during World War I, the city was taken from Turkey by British
forces under General Edmund Henry Hynman Allenby.<br><br>
By the terms of the United Nations (UN) plan of 1947 providing for the
partition of Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state, Gaza was to
have been included in the Arab area. In 1948 , during the war between
Jewish the Arabs , Egyptian forces retained Gaza and the surrounding area ,
which came to be called the Gaza Strip. This territory came under the
control of Egypt by the terms of the Arab Israeli armistice agreement of
1949 . In the course of the war some 200,000 Palestinian refugees from the
Palestinian occupied land by Israel settled in the strip, doubling the
population. Although the city of Gaza has bazaars and markets and some
light industry, and the Gaza Strip is an established citrus producing area
, the economy cannot support the large population , which has been aided by
the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the
Near East.<br><br>
In the spring of 1956 several military clashes between Egypt and Israel
took place in the Gaza Strip. Israel accused Egypt of using the area as a
base for commando raids into Israeli territory . In October 1956, shortly
before the invasion of the Suez Canal Zone of Egypt by French and British
forces, Israeli troops seized the Gaza Strip and advanced into the Sinai
Peninsula. The following March a UN emergency force replaced the Israeli
troops, and Egypt regained control of the civil administration of the
strip.<br><br>
Israeli forces seized the area again during the Arab Israeli War of June
67.<br><br>
The 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel called for eventual
self rule for the Palestinians in the strip.<br><br>
Beginning in December 1987, the area was site of al-Intifada,
demonstrations by Palestinians demanding self rule.<br><br>
In September 1993, after secret negotiations, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
of Israel and Chairman Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation
Organization signed a peace accord calling for withdrawal of the Israeli
military from the Gaza Strip and other areas , and for Palestinian
administration of the local government.<br><br>
In May 1994 Israeli troops withdrew from the Palestinian towns and refugee
camps of the Gaza Strip, and the area came under Palestinian authority.</p><br>
