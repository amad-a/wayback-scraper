<p>Another anti-Arab terrorist group, Terror Against Terror (known as TNT) was
established by Kach, the right-wing extremist political movement of Rabbi
Meir Kahane. TNT was responsible for numerous beatings and bombings and
several murders of Arabs, beginning in 1975. Defending Shield (Egrof
Magen), a Jewish vigilante group of West Bank settlers formed in 1983, was
responsible for a number of attacks and vandalizing of Arab property on
the West Bank. During the intifadah, beginning in late 1987, there were
many reports of Jewish vigilantism, including shootings, punitive raids on
refugee camps, and assaults on Arab motorists in retaliation for
rock throwing attacks by Arab youths. Most of these appeared to be
spontaneous actions by settlers of individual communities.</p><br><br>
