<center>Hebron city in the West Bank</center>
<p>Hebron, city in the West Bank, near Jerusalem. Israel has occupied Hebron
since 1967, when it captured the West Bank and other territories in the
Six-Day War. Hebron is one of oldest communities in the world. Among the
interesting features of Hebron are the narrow, winding streets , the
flat-roofed stone houses , the bazaars , and the mosque of al-Haram
al-Ebrahimi. The mosque is built on top of the cave that is believed to
hold the tombs of Abraham and his family. In the top of this cave is
al-Ebrahimi mosque.<br><br>
Hebron's population is Arab Muslim, although Israelis have settled in the
city since 1967 . A large Israeli settlement called Qiryat Arba lies on the
outskirts of Hebron . Hebron has a number of small scale industrial
establishments that produce cotton goods , leather , water containers,
glass bracelets, rings, lamps, and ceramics.<br><br>
British troops occupied Hebron in December 1917, during World War I. Hebron
was part of the British mandate for Palestine from 1923 until 1948 . In
1949 Jordan controled Hebron and the rest of West Bank . In June 1967 ,
following the Six-Day War between Israel and Arab countries, Israeli troops
took control of the West Bank.<br><br>
In February 1994 an Israeli settler massacred at least 29 Palestinians in
al-Haram al-Ebrahimi mosque.<br><br>
Population (estimated) 75,000.</p><br>
