Al-Birah (east) and north of Jerusalem. Ram Allah has since the Six-Day War
of 1967 been under Israeli occupation as part of the West Bank territory.
Situated  on  the crest of the Judaean Hills, at an elevation of 2,861 feet

slightly  more  than  half  Christian,  while  Al-Birah,  including a large
