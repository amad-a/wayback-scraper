<pre><p align="center">Hebron,  city  in the West Bank, near Jerusalem. Israel has occupied Hebron
since  1967,  when  it  captured the West Bank and other territories in the
Six-Day  War.  Hebron  is one of oldest communities in the world. Among the
interesting  features  of  Hebron  are  the  narrow,  winding streets , the
flat-roofed  stone  houses  ,  the  bazaars  ,  and  the mosque of al-Haram
al-Ebrahimi.  The  mosque  is  built on top of the cave that is believed to
hold  the  tombs  of  Abraham  and  his  family. In the top of this cave is
al-Ebrahimi mosque.
Hebron's  population  is Arab Muslim, although Israelis have settled in the
city since 1967 . A large Israeli settlement called Qiryat Arba lies on the
outskirts  of  Hebron  .  Hebron  has  a  number  of small scale industrial
establishments  that  produce  cotton  goods  , leather , water containers,
glass bracelets, rings, lamps, and ceramics.
British troops occupied Hebron in December 1917, during World War I. Hebron
was  part  of  the  British mandate for Palestine from 1923 until 1948 . In
1949  Jordan  controled  Hebron  and the rest of West Bank . In June 1967 ,
following the Six-Day War between Israel and Arab countries, Israeli troops
took control of the West Bank .
In  February  1994 an Israeli settler massacred at least 29 Palestinians in
al-Haram al-Ebrahimi mosque .
Population (estimated) 75,000.</p></pre>
