If the two sides inter-breed and the next generation don't know who they are and don't care, for me that will suffice. Nationalism is beautiful, but peace is more important.<br>

My Note:  There is not much to say without voicing my anger, hurt &amp; fear.  We all hope for peace but reality awakens us.  I do not wish for any religion or nationality to live like this but as history, the present and I believe the future will hold for us as humans, it will never change.

I think this Web site is useful too the ignorate and not knowing. I think that if any of these Americans think we are the terrorist they should look into it more of the truth of Jerusalm and How the Jewish people got there you be quit suprised at the out come of it all. It will make you wip in sore and pain for Palestine and their country.<br>
I only hope for the knowledge for other people to learn the truth.....<br>

I am terribly sorry for the oppression of the Palestinians.  Two wrongs do NOT make a right and do NOT give Israel the right to do what they are doing.  I am embarrassed by how my country is reacting to the current crisis and can only hope that we will take a firmer stand agains Israel and for the Palestinian cause.<br>
<br>
However, I think extremist religion in any form is toxic, and when I read many of the comments in this guest book I was shocked at how ignorant many people are (for example the guy who is convinced the Jews are responsible for September 11th - please).  It is ignorance and religious extremism that cause these problems and it will NEVER be resolved unless people grow up and open their eyes.  "An eye for an eye" has never worked and will not further anyone's cause.  Education, the tempering of extremist views, and true diplomacy are the only long-term solutions for this problem.<br>

For years we natives lived freely on this land. When the White man came, the White man drove us off our soil, raped us, tortured us and separated families. We were put on reservations. Even buffalo that had freedom were killed.<br>
<br>
You are presently living on occupied land. It is wonderful to complain about other occupiers. While you yourself are living on land confiscated from others, that seems fine though. Immigrants have more rights than me. They can move into land I was driven from. You are hypocrites.<br>

I just don't understand how anyone can support Israel.  Unfortunately, I believe the media coverage about the whole situation is very one-sided in the USA... I think people need to be more information about the history of Palestine before making a judgment. Maybe the internet is the answer to spread the word? your site is a good start, I will recommend it to my friends!<br>
<br>
Also see Amnesty International to help ensure the rights of the Palestinians that are being held by Israel. http://www.stoptorture.org/index.htm<br>
<br>
My thoughts are with all those who must suffer in the Terror procreated by the Israeli armed forces.<br>

Prior to 1948, Palestine was a nation.  It was a nation at the time of Jesus Christ.  Jesus was a Jew, and he lived in Palestine.  Israel does need a place to call home, but why are they taking more than was origianally given them.  I hope a peaceful resolution is found soon.  Two nations can live together as neighbours.  Respect for each other's tradations is a step in the right direction.<br>

<br>
Mr. President and Mr. Powell<br>
<br>
As I have written to you several times over this past year I have expected a reply. Just, as I would expect the USA to Honor its commitment to the Arabian Nations of the Middle East in getting a free Palestinian Nation.<br>
You, Mr. President, claim to want peace in the Middle East? Yet, you Mr. President and Mr. Powell expect President Arafat to control the militants in his country when he is cut off from all communications? This is an impossible request to comply with at anytime. Further, what Leader would even put forth such a ridiculous idea?<br>
Mr. Sharon is not a peace wanting leader! Mr. Sharon�s actions over this past year, and all of his life are that of a butcher! A butcher, bent on destroying all Palestinians. Mr. Sharon�s next action might be to have all babies killed to prevent the next one from becoming a martyr in the fight to free the Palestinian people from an unjust biased ruling dictator that is not even close to a democracy.<br>
<br>
Mr. Sharon�s people are in fact steeling the land from the Palestinians ever since 1967!<br>
Security Council resolution 452, July 20, 1979:<br>
It says Israel's practice of establishing settlements in the occupied territories "has no legal validity and constitutes a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War" and calls on Israel to cease building settlements. Israel has continued to build and enlarge its settlements; it maintains that the Fourth Geneva Conventions do not apply.<br>
<br>
Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been evicted to refuge camps and thousands of acres of land have been stolen from the Palestinian people, by Israel claiming land for defense purposes. Lands that Israel could not get through the previous method, they get by murdering a father or a son claiming them to be members of a militant organization. Kicking out the remaining family and confiscating the property. If that is not good enough Israel will claim that the Palestinian has not the �proper�<br>
<br>
documentation proof of ownership and remove the family to refugee camps (like Hitler�s Germany?).<br>
<br>
Can you justify the Israeli acts? I do not believe so! If you, Mr. President, want peace in the Middle East then you will have to take an unbiased stand that must include the United Nations Resolutions. Resolutions, Mr. President, that you as the leader of a Free Nation must up hold along with international laws that can not be ignored any longer by the Israeli Government!<br>
Security Council resolution 242, Nov. 22, 1967:<br>
It calls for "withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied" in the 1967 Six Day War and for "respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force." The resolution was not carried out because the Arab side did not recognize Israel, and Israel refused to withdraw.<br>
Israel maintains that since the resolution speaks of "territories" and not "the territories" it does not mean withdrawal from all the occupied lands; opponents counter this by pointing to the resolution's preamble which speaks of "the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war."<br>
Security Council resolution 338, adopted Oct. 22, 1973, after the Middle East war that year, reaffirms resolution 242.<br>
<br>
The Israel government cannot continue to ignore these issues, the Arab world has justified claims and particularly the Palestinian People have just claims. Israel is not above the law here!  Israel must own up to its part in this conflict. Israeli is the perpetrator of violence against the citizens of Palestine. Not one person has gone untouched by the method of seizure of personal property at the hand of the Israeli government. In may cases the people have lost life to the Israeli I.D.F. This
causes many thousands of Palestinian youth and adults to engage in the human bomb attacks against the Israeli nation. When your youth and young adults find no hope in any other means to get an occupying army out of their homes and country!  The Palestinian nation exists, not living, under brutal Nazi like methods of the Israeli Government, methods designed to force the Palestinian people from their homes and homeland at any cost. Israel should be ashamed of these methods used on the Palestinian  people! The means do not justify the end! Here again Mr. President I, as an American, cannot believe we the United States of America can justify Israeli brutality. And we as the United States of America cannot and should not assist any friend or foe in the perpetration of injustice and forfeiture of basic freedoms.<br>
<br>
Cut off the billions of dollars �given to Israel and place these nations on the same footing. Take away the military might or give it equally to both sides. No one can fight, yet the Palestinians have and are fighting, a nation with modern weapons using them as a means to take the Palestinian homes and land from the true countrymen of Palestine.<br>
<br>
Divide this country, as it should be. Give no recognition to the Israeli settlements if it falls in the Israeli half then so be it. If it falls in the Palestinian half so be it. If you wish to live under the Israeli flag go to that half. If you wish to live under the Palestinian flag go to that half. Make a five-kilometer path with Jerusalem as the middle (2.5 kilometers on either side of Jerusalem) of the path from the Dead Sea to the Mediterranean Sea under control by international forces not  Israeli or Arabic. Give this area true international stature not claims of ownership.<br>
<br>
Do not at this time give the Israeli the benefit of friendship. A friendship lost to most of America, as they do not deserve our trust. They have backstabbed the United States of America( USS LIberty) and the Arab world and we cannot continue in the support of Israeli until they give up the arrogant belief that they own the Palestinian land, and are the righteous rulers of the region. The Israeli's are not the legitimate people of this land.<br>
Support the region not a nation that is a cancer in the Middle East.<br>
<br>
Thank you Mr. President,<br>

I love my country, the USA, and if anyone invaded it I would resist and strike back at the enemy any way I could.  Would I be called a terrorist or gunman? If I had few ways to defend myself would any superpower defend me?  Would the world have moral displeasure? Would my catholic friends help me to protect my freedom from a nazi type regime? Would the fair minded news reporters be kept from seeing the truth? Would any one care? Is life so cheap? The invader would want to wipe out all resistance in the USA to gain my countries territory and water resources.  Who could I turn to if my President was held captive? Would my country the USA, be enslaved? Is might right? Someone answer.<br>

Although I feel that the loose of human life must end at the hands of both sides in the middle east conflict... i support the immediate withdrawl of the israeli occupation from the west bank allowing freedom for the peoples of palestine and peace throughout this region .....<br>

This is a message for the First Nations gentleman who commented that the Palestinians are hypocrits because his land is still being occupated.  First of all use your real name instead of using the White Man's name, Jon.  Second of all instead of supporting the Palestinians, because you know what they are going through, you only put them down.  What ever happened to not wishing on somebody the pains you went through?<br>

It seems all is a question of power, oil, money, sex...religion is an excuse!<br>
Make love not war died with Lennon and so a new generation of peace is born. The situation in the middle East is nothing new, it is sickening to see war and like any war the real sufferers are children. I am not your religion but I do have an open mind and I respect a mans way but it is all a bit confusing. I never judge anybody, if I do have to then I will only judge one on how he treats others and for Bush/Sharon/Blair I feel they have treated Palestinians as second rate citizens. SHOCKING, on UK TV we have to endure hours of Queen Mum who had 101 years of comfort and yet we are led to forget about an 18 year old who lost life by fighting for his/her rights. What the world is coming to I will never understand, I just thank everyday when I can look into my fridge and see mountains of fresh food...that is a luxury, I can walk streets without the chance of a  bullet meeting and I feel guilty as hell.To all who want peace may it become your dream come true (I back you all the way) to all who fight back because they are oppressed I recognize you and I would do the same.<br>

My country that I served<br>
she did employ me<br>
<br>
My unit that I ranked <br>
it did deploy me<br>
<br>
The enemy that was sent to greet me in the trenches<br>
was sent to destroy me<br>
<br>
But I did not fall into the arms of evil<br>
<br>
<br>
The more dark blue uniforms I slaughtered<br>
made me feel a lesser man<br>
<br>
The more I aimed my weapon and hit my human target<br>
the further away from home I felt that I didn�t belong in<br>
<br>
But I did not fall into the arms of evil<br>
<br>
<br>
my shell for a corpse lies empty inside a polished coffin<br>
my nations proud flag drapes neatly creased and folded<br>
and under the white cross, poppy flowers swaying to the tune of bugles and bagpipes<br>
<br>
lies the Unknown Soldier<br>

It�s not where you come from<br>

It�s not how fast you think you can run<br>
<br>
<br>
It�s not the way you eliminated  the weak in you<br>
that separated  your right from wrong<br>

We, 
the natives lived here for centuries until the White man came. We were driven off the land. Our mothers were raped. Many trives were exterminated. We were ethnically cleansed and tortured. Our villages were all destroyed.<br>
<br>
You guys, in what is now called USA are living off the fat of occupied land. What a double standard. You upset about losing your land, but it's fine to live on land stolen for others. WHAT HYPOCRITES.<br>
<br>
You claim Palestine had nothing to do with what the Nazis did. Well we, the First Nations, had nothing to do with you guys. Now you living off the fat of our Nakbar.<br>
<br>
I give you all a choice:<br>
1)Shut up your campaign<br>
or<br>
2)Get off my occupied land.<br>
<br>
Living on occupied land while complaining of others, then this whole sight has zero credibility.<br><hr>

I think that bush is making an excuse that he will stop the war so the arabs could keep their mouths shut. I think people need to stand up for there rights and show the people why  palestinians have been suffering all there lives. I inshallah will try hard to settle this peace agreement even though im only 15. But im going to help the palestinians get there land back. I watch the news everyday and see a israeli person lie and say they didnt take tanks to the west bank ramallah and kill anybody. Thats a big lie because every person that walks in the street is killed and that is no human rights. We palestinians need to be strong and stay in the religion of islam so allah can help us and the palestinians be free and thats the right thing.<br><hr>

I think the Americans/Israelis are tring to take over all the arab countries so they can rule the whole world. I think the jews did the accident in 9/11 because thats the only excuse they use when to blame things at the palestinians and they call us terrorist. I think it is very wrong for the israelis to kill so many lives, but sharon will get paid back soon. Everybody knows there would be a war and blood will come up to peoples knees and the palestinians will get there land back in the end to prove to the world that islam is the right religion.<br><hr>

Your site has certainly been enlightening, moreso since most of the news we have been viewing have been slanted in favor of the Israelis, and their sufferings.  Your information has helped me to better understand the Palestinian situation and what led to this point.  Somehow this information should get beyond this site, and more in the public's viewing to balance the seemingly one-sided news reporting.  My sympathies to those who have been forced from their homes, and have endured endless sufferings, and may peace be close at hand.<br><hr>

At the moment I withhold my opinion on much of what is occuring in the Holy Land.  I only wish to comment on what happened on Easter Sunday.  If Palestine is counting on the support of historically Christian nations, I only recommend that those who support Palestine should have had more respect for one of the holiest days in the Christian calendar.<br>
I'm very sorry for all bloodshed, please don't alienize those that support you.<br>

I have read many of the articles posted on your site. I would like to share the following comments, and they are only my opinions.<br>
<br>
To the people of both Palastine and Isreal, my heart aches for the pain you are suffering.  I can only watch the daily newscasts and try to understand in my own mind where the truth lies and where rhetoric is offered only for political expediency.  I pray that the international community will rise up and help to bring true peace to two peoples who claim that peace is their ultimate wish.  <br>
<br>
When evil people use religion as justification for inflicting their will on people, servitude will prevail and peace and freedom will be diminished.  <br>
