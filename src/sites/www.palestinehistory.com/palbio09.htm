<p>Also called AL-HAJJ AMIN (born 1897, Jerusalem, Palestine, - d. July 4,
1974, Beirut, Lebanon), Mufti of Jerusalem and Arab nationalist figure who
played a major role in Arab resistance to Zionist political ambitions in
Palestine.<br><br>
Husayni studied in Jerusalem, Cairo, and Istanbul, and in 1910 he was
commissioned in the Turkish artillery. He became a strong voice in the Arab
nationalist and anti-Zionist movements. In Jan 1922 the British, who had
accepted a mandate for Palestine after World War I, named Husayni permanent
president and mufti of the newly created Supreme Muslim Council the most
authoritative religious body in the Palestinian Muslim community.<br><br>
In 1936 all the Palestinian groups joined to create a permanent executive
organ known as the Arab High Committee under Husayni's chairmanship. The
committee demanded a cessation of Jewish immigration and a prohibition of
land transfers from Arabs to Jews. A general strike developed into a
rebellion against British authority. The British removed Husayni from the
council presidency and declared the committee illegal in Palestine. In
October 1937 he fled to Lebanon, where he reconstituted the committee under
his domination.<br><br>
The rebellion forced Britain to make substantial concessions to Arab
demands in 1939. The British abandoned the idea of establishing Palestine
as a Jewish state, and, while Jewish immigration was to continue for
another five years, it was thereafter to depend on Arab consent. Husayni,
however, felt that the concessions did not go far enough, and he repudiated
the new policy.<br><br>
Ceasing to play an active role in Palestinian affairs, Husayni spent most
of World War II (1939-45) in Germany. At the war's end he fled to Egypt.</p><br><br>
