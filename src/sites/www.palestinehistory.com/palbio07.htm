<p>Palestinian uprising, Most of the Palestinians people active between
1987 to 1993 in attacks on armed Israeli troops in the occupied territories of
Palestine. Their campaign for self-determination included stone throwing
and petrol bombing.<br><br>
The uprising began Dec 1987 in the Gaza Strip. Rumors that a fatal deliberated traffic
collision had been caused by Israeli security service agents in retaliation
for the stabbing of an Israeli the previous week led to demonstrations by
teenagers armed with slingshots. It subsequently spread, despite attempts
at repression. Some 1,300 Palestinians were Martyred and 80 Israelis were killed in the
uprising up to the end of 1991. Many Palestinian private homes were
dynamited by military order, under a still-valid British emergency
regulation of 1946 . The number of soldiers on duty on the West Bank at the
beginning of 1989 was said to be more than three times the number needed to
conquer it during the Six Day War.<br><br>
The 1993 peace accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization effectively liberated the occupied territories of Gaza and
Jericho. However , Islamic groups that had participated in the Intifada,
notably the militant wing of the Hamas islamic group, opposed the accord
and continued a campaign of attacks within Israel.</p><br><br>
