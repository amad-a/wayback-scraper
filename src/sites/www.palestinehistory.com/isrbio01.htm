<center>Theodor Herzl , Founder of Zionism</center>
<p>Political movement advocating the establishment of a Jewish homeland in
Palestine, the �promised land� of the Bible.<br><br>
1896 As a response to European anti-Semitism, Theodor Herzl published his
Jewish State, outlining a scheme for setting up an autonomous Jewish
commonwealth .<br><br>
1897 The World Zionist Congress was established in Basel, Switzerland, with
Herzl as its first president. �Hatikva� (The Hope) was adopted as the
Zionist anthem, which was the unofficial anthem of Israel until 1948 when
it was sung at the proclamation of the State of Israel on May 14.<br><br>
1917 The Balfour Declaration was secured from Britain by Chaim Weizmann. It
promised the Jews a homeland in Palestine.<br><br>
1940-48 Jewish settlement in the British mandate of Palestine led to armed
conflict between militant Zionists Irgun and Stern Gang and both
Palestinian Arabs and the British.<br><br>
1947 In Nov the United Nations (UN) issued a resolution in order to divided
Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem as an international
city.<br><br>
1948 The Jews in Palestine proclaimed the State of Israel on May 14, but
the Arab states rejected both the partition of Palestine and the existence
of Israel. The armies of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Trans-Jordan, Saudi Arabia,
Yemen, and Egypt crossed Palestine borders and attacked but were defeated
by the Israeli army (Haganah).<br><br>
1975 The General Assembly of the UN condemned Zionism as �a form of racism
and racial discrimination�; among those voting against the resolution were
the USA and the members of the European Community (now the European Union).</p><br><br>
