<p>Following an argument which broke out between Palestinian workers and
Jewish workers in the Haifa Petroleum Refinery, leading to the deaths of a
number of Palestinians and wounding and killing approximately sixty Jews.
The Zionest ganges planned to take revenge on behalf of fellow Jews who had
been killed by attacking Baldat al-Shaikh and Hawasa where most of the
workers live.<br><br>
On the night of January 30-31, 1947, a mixed force composed of the First
Battalion of Palmakh and the Carmelie brigade (estimated at approximately
150 to 200 terrorists) launched a raid against the two towns under the
leadership of Hayim Afinuam. Taking the homes by surprise as their
inhabitants slept, they pelted them with hand grenades, then went inside,
firing their machine guns. The terrorist attack led to the deaths of
approximately sixty citizens inside their homes, most of them women,
elderly and children.<br><br>
The attack lasted for an hour, after which the Zionists withdrew at 2:00
A.M. after attacking a large number of homes.<br><br>
According to a report written by the leader of the terrorist operation, "
the attacking units slipped into the town and began working on the houses.
And due to the fact that gunfire was directed inside the rooms, it was not
possible to avoid injuring women and children. "</p><br>
