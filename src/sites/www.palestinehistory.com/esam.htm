<center>My name is Esam Shashaa , born in Dubai city in the United Arab
Emirates on 21 February 1968 .</center>
<p>Our family routes are more then 700 years old in Gaza city in Gaza
Strip. My father left Gaza on 1961 when he was 22 years old to Kuwait
to seek a job there to support his family back home and to build his
future , worked as a school teacher in Ajman city in what later became
as United Arab Emirates on the Kuwaiti educational team assigned to
start the educational system in Ajman, Dubai and Sharjah. on 1972 when
the seven Emirates united in a new state called United Arab Emirates ,
father joined the UAE ministry of education and served his next 30+
years in Dubai city and later on early 80's we shifted to Sharjah city
, on the year 1999 he retired and gone to home ( Gaza city ) to spend
the rest of his live there .. In 1967 when he was in Ajman ( with my
mother and three of my brothers ), the 1967 war broke out and Israel
toke control of Gaza Strip and other Arab lands , my father and other
family members with him lost there national ID and since then we are
not having a National ID and we are not allowed to live in Gaza city
or even to go there unless we get a Visa from the Israeli authority
and number of times such visa has been rejected .<br><br>
My self, I lived my live in UAE and studded in 1985 in UAE University
in Al-Ain city . In 1989 I hold my degree in Business Administration
and Accounts with A+ marks . Since then (1989) I joined a new
established can making company in Sharjah as an accountant and I was
promoted as a Chief Accountant . I am married to a far relative from
mother side from Gaza City also , and happy to raise a smart boy born
in 15 March 1999 .<br><br>
I was always interested in Computers (I got my first computer in 1987)
and since 1990 I was involved in local BBS and on-line community , and
as soon as the Internet services started in UAE in August 1995 I got
my first open eye on the real world on on-line community , which was a
real change in my live .<br><br>
I started my first site about computer programs in 1996 , after few
months I got an e-mail from another Palestinian how suggest me to
invest my time in more useful work and he suggested to build a site
about Palestine , I liked the idea and I started to collect as much as
I can of data to review it and made the site . After few years this
small work is now a huge collection of encyclopedic references
articles about the HISTORY of PALESTINE , which is recognized by a
very important news media sites such as CNN , BBC News and The Times,
as a reference to the history of Palestine as will as a lot of
complements e-mails from all over the world even from some Israelis
national which sees a lot of fairness in the site contents . Therefore
, the site is under regular update and additions to keep the readers
and visitors interested .<br><br>
For more information please e-mail to the address bellow .<br><br>
Yours ,<br><br>
Esam Shashaa</p><br>
