<p><font color="FF0000">A nation that has violated “every norm of civilized behavior and international law” since its founding in 1948 is held virtually blameless by the U.S. corporate media – Israel sycophants of the lowest order. “Now members of the Israeli Defense Force themselves are coming forward to admit that they committed war crimes” – but the U.S. press is censoring their confessions! Even when Israeli soldiers openly testify to committing “murder” in Gaza, as reported by the Israeli press, the U.S. corporate media “keeps the people of this country ignorant” of the crimes against humanity bankrolled by American taxpayers.

Part of a Broader Israeli Military-Intelligence Agenda<br>
By Michel Chossudovsky<br>
January 04, 2009 "Global Research"<br>
</font>
<p><font color="FFCC00" size="5"><b>The aerial bombings and the ongoing ground invasion of Gaza by Israeli ground forces must be analysed in a historical context. Operation "Cast Lead" is a carefully planned undertaking, which is part of a broader military-intelligence agenda first formulated by the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2001:  
<p>"Sources in the defense establishment said Defense Minister Ehud Barak instructed the Israel Defense Forces to prepare for the operation over six months ago, even as Israel was beginning to negotiate a ceasefire agreement with Hamas."(Barak Ravid, Operation "Cast Lead": Israeli Air Force strike followed months of planning, Haaretz, December 27, 2008)
It was Israel which broke the truce on the day of the US presidential elections, November 4: 
"Israel used this distraction to break the ceasefire between itself and Hamas by bombing the Gaza strip.  Israel claimed this violation of the ceasefire was to prevent Hamas from digging tunnels into Israeli territory.
<p>The very next day, Israel launched a terrorizing siege of Gaza, cutting off food, fuel, medical supplies and other necessities in an attempt to �subdue� the Palestinians while at the same time engaging in armed incursions. 
In response, Hamas and others in Gaza again resorted to firing crude, homemade, and mainly inaccurate rockets into Israel.  During the past seven years, these rockets have been responsible for the deaths of 17 Israelis.  Over the same time span, Israeli Blitzkrieg assaults have killed thousands of Palestinians, drawing worldwide protest but falling on deaf ears at the UN." (Shamus Cooke, The Massacre in Palestine and the Threat of a Wider War, Global Research, December 2008)
<p>Planned Humanitarian Disaster
<p>On December 8, US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte was in Tel Aviv for discussions with his Israeli counterparts including the director of Mossad, Meir Dagan. 
<p>"Operation Cast Lead" was initiated two days day after Christmas. It was coupled with a carefully designed international Public Relations campaign under the auspices of Israel's Foreign Ministry.
Hamas' military targets are not the main objective. Operation "Cast Lead" is intended, quite deliberately, to trigger civilian casualities. 
What we are dealing with is a "planned humanitarian disaster" in Gaza in a densly populated urban area. (See map below) 
<p>The longer term objective of this plan, as formulated by Israeli policy makers, is the expulsion of Palestinians from Palestinian lands:  
"Terrorize the civilian population, assuring maximal destruction of property and cultural resources... [T]he daily life of the Palestinians must be rendered unbearable: They should be locked up in cities and towns, prevented from exercising normal economic life, cut off from workplaces, schools and hospitals, This will encourage emigration and weaken the resistance to future expulsions" Ur Shlonsky, quoted by Ghali Hassan, Gaza: The World�s Largest Prison, Global Research, 2005)
"Operation Justified Vengeance"
<p>A turning point has been reached. Operation "Cast Lead" is part of the broader military-intelligence operation initiated at the outset the Ariel Sharon government in  2001. It was under Sharon's "Operation Justified Vengeance" that  F-16 fighter planes were initially used to bomb Palestinian cities. 
"Operation Justified Vengeance" was presented in July 2001 to the Israeli government of Ariel Sharon by IDF chief of staff Shaul Mofaz, under the title "The Destruction of the Palestinian Authority and Disarmament of All Armed Forces". 
<p>"A contingency plan, codenamed Operation Justified Vengeance, was drawn up last June [2001] to reoccupy all of the West Bank and possibly the Gaza Strip at a likely cost of "hundreds" of Israeli casualties." (Washington Times, 19 March 2002). 
<p>According to Jane's 'Foreign Report' (July 12, 2001) the Israeli army under Sharon had updated its plans for an "all-out assault to smash the Palestinian authority, force out leader Yasser Arafat and kill or detain its army".  
"Bloodshed Justification"
<p>The "Bloodshed Justification" was an essential component of the military-intelligence agenda. The killing of Palestinian civilians was justified on "humanitarian grounds." Israeli military operations were carefully timed to coincide with the suicide attacks:
The assault would be launched, at the government's discretion, after a big suicide bomb attack in Israel, causing widespread deaths and injuries, citing the bloodshed as justification. (Tanya Reinhart, Evil Unleashed, Israel's move to destroy the Palestinian Authority is a calculated plan, long in the making, Global Research, December 2001, emphasis added) 
The Dagan Plan 
<p>"Operation Justified Vengeance" was also referred to as the "Dagan Plan", named after General (ret.) Meir Dagan, who currently heads Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency. 
<p>Reserve General Meir Dagan was Sharon's national security adviser during the 2000 election campaign. The plan was apparently drawn up prior to Sharon�s election as Prime Minister in February 2001. "According to Alex Fishman writing in Yediot Aharonot, the Dagan Plan consisted in destroying the Palestinian authority and putting Yasser Arafat 'out of the game'." (Ellis Shulman, "Operation Justified Vengeance": a Secret Plan to Destroy the Palestinian Authority, March 2001): 
<p>"As reported in the Foreign Report [Jane] and disclosed locally by Maariv, Israel's invasion plan � reportedly dubbed Justified Vengeance � would be launched immediately following the next high-casualty suicide bombing, would last about a month and is expected to result in the death of hundreds of Israelis and thousands of Palestinians. (Ibid, emphasis added)
The "Dagan Plan" envisaged the so-called "cantonization" of the Palestinian territories whereby the West Bank and Gaza would be totally cut off from one other, with separate "governments" in each of the territories. Under this scenario, already envisaged in 2001, Israel would:
<p> "negotiate separately with Palestinian forces that are dominant in each territory-Palestinian forces responsible for security, intelligence, and even for the Tanzim (Fatah)." The plan thus closely resembles the idea of "cantonization" of Palestinian territories, put forth by a number of ministers." Sylvain Cypel, The infamous 'Dagan Plan' Sharon's plan for getting rid of Arafat, Le Monde, December 17, 2001)
<p>From Left to Right: Dagan, Sharon, Halevy
<p>The Dagan Plan has established continuity in the military-intelligence agenda. In the wake of the 2000 elections, Meir Dagan was assigned a key role. "He became Sharon�s "go-between" in security issues with President�s Bush�s special envoys Zinni and Mitchell."  He was subsequently appointed Director of the Mossad by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in August 2002. In the post-Sharon period, he remained head of Mossad. He was reconfirmed in his position as Director of Israeli Intelligence by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in June 2008. 
Meir Dagan, in coordination with his US counterparts, has been in charge of various military-intelligence operations. It is worth noting that Meir Dagan as a young Colonel had worked closely with defense minister Ariel Sharon in the raids on Palestinian settlements in Beirut in 1982. The 2009 ground invasion of Gaza, in many regards, bear a canny resemblance to the 1982 military operation led by Sharon and Dagan. 
<p>Continuity: From Sharon  to Olmert 
<p>It is important to focus on a number of key events which have led up to the killings in Gaza under "Operation Cast Lead":  
<p>1. The assassination in November 2004 of Yaser Arafat. This assassination had been on the drawing board since 1996 under "Operation Fields of Thorns". According to an October 2000 document "prepared by the security services, at the request of then Prime Minister Ehud Barak, stated that 'Arafat, the person, is a severe threat to the security of the state [of Israel] and the damage which will result from his disappearance is less than the damage caused by his existence'". (Tanya Reinhart, Evil Unleashed, Israel's move to destroy the Palestinian Authority is a calculated plan, long in the making, Global Research, December 2001. Details of the document were published in Ma'ariv, July 6, 2001.). 
<p>Arafat's assassination was ordered in 2003 by the Israeli cabinet. It was approved by the US which vetoed a United Nations Security Resolution condemning the 2003 Israeli Cabinet decision. Reacting to increased Palestinian attacks, in August 2003, Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz declared "all out war" on the militants whom he vowed "marked for death." 
"In mid September, Israel's government passed a law to get rid of Arafat. Israel's cabinet for political security affairs declared it "a decision to remove Arafat as an obstacle to peace." Mofaz threatened; "we will choose the right way and the right time to kill Arafat." Palestinian Minister Saeb Erekat told CNN he thought Arafat was the next target. CNN asked Sharon spokesman Ra'anan Gissan if the vote meant expulsion of Arafat. Gissan clarified; "It doesn't mean that. The Cabinet has today resolved to remove this obstacle. The time, the method, the ways by which this will take place will be decided separately, and the security services will monitor the situation and make the recommendation about proper action." (See Trish Shuh, Road Map for a Decease Plan,  www.mehrnews.com November 9 2005
<p>The assassination of Arafat was part of the 2001 Dagan Plan. In all likelihood, it was carried out by Israeli Intelligence. It was intended to destroy the Palestinian Authority, foment divisions within Fatah as well as between Fatah and Hamas. Mahmoud Abbas is a Palestinian quisling. He was installed as leader of Fatah, with the approval of Israel and the US, which finance the Palestinian Authority's paramilitary and security forces.
<p>2. The removal, under the orders of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2005, of all Jewish settlements in Gaza. A Jewish population of over 7,000 was relocated.
"It is my intention [Sharon] to carry out an evacuation � sorry, a relocation � of settlements that cause us problems and of places that we will not hold onto anyway in a final settlement, like the Gaza settlements.... I am working on the assumption that in the future there will be no Jews in Gaza," Sharon said." (CBC, March 2004)
<p>The issue of the settlements in Gaza was presented as part of Washington's "road map to peace". Celebrated by the Palestinians as a "victory", this measure was not directed against the Jewish settlers. Quite the opposite: It was part of  the overall covert operation, which consisted  in transforming Gaza into a concentration camp. As long as Jewish settlers were living inside Gaza, the objective of sustaining a large barricaded prison territory could not be achieved. The Implementation of "Operation Cast Lead" required "no Jews in Gaza".   
3. The building of the infamous Apartheid Wall was decided upon at the beginning of the Sharon government.  
4. The next phase was the Hamas election victory in January 2006. Without Arafat, the Israeli military-intelligence architects knew that Fatah under Mahmoud Abbas would loose the elections. This was part of the scenario, which had been envisaged and analyzed well in advance. 
<p>With Hamas in charge of the Palestinian authority, using the pretext that Hamas is a terrorist organization, Israel would carry out the process of "cantonization" as formulated under the Dagan plan. Fatah under Mahmoud Abbas would remain formally in charge of the West Bank. The duly elected Hamas government would be confined to the Gaza strip. 
Ground Attack
On January 3, Israeli tanks and infantry entered Gaza in an all out ground offensive: 
<p>"The ground operation was preceded by several hours of heavy artillery fire after dark, igniting targets in flames that burst into the night sky. Machine gun fire rattled as bright tracer rounds flashed through the darkness and the crash of hundreds of shells sent up streaks of fire. (AP, January 3, 2009)
Israeli sources have pointed to a lengthy drawn out military operation. It "won't be easy and it won't be short," said Defense Minister Ehud Barak in a TV address. 
Israel is not seeking to oblige Hamas "to cooperate". What we are dealing with is the implementation of the "Dagan Plan" as initially formulated in 2001, which called for: 
"an invasion of Palestinian-controlled territory by some 30,000 Israeli soldiers, with the clearly defined mission of destroying the infrastructure of the Palestinian leadership and collecting weaponry currently possessed by the various Palestinian forces, and expelling or killing its military leadership. (Ellis Shulman, op cit, emphasis added)
The broader question is whether Israel in consultation with Washington is intent upon triggering a wider war. 
<p>Mass expulsion could occur at some later stage of the ground invasion, were the Israelis to open up Gaza's borders to allow for an exodus of population. Expulsion was referred to by Ariel Sharon as the "a 1948 style solution". For Sharon "it is only necessary to find another state for the Palestinians. -'Jordan is Palestine' - was the phrase that Sharon coined."

 Can anyone who is following the Israeli air attacks on
 Gaza-the buildings blown to rubble, the children killed on
 their way to school, the long rows of mutilated corpses, the
 wailing mothers and wives, the crowds of terrified
 Palestinians not knowing where to flee, the hospitals so
 overburdened and out of supplies they cannot treat the
 wounded, and our studied, callous indifference to this
 widespread human suffering-wonder why we are hated?
<p>
 Our self-righteous celebration of ourselves and our
 supposed virtue is as false as that of Israel. We have
 become monsters, militarized bullies, heartless and savage.
 We are a party to human slaughter, a flagrant war crime, and
 do nothing. We forget that the innocents who suffer and die
 in Gaza are a reflection of ourselves, of how we might have
 been should fate and time and geography have made the
 circumstances of our birth different. We forget that we are
 all absurd and vulnerable creatures. We all have the
 capacity to fear and hate and love. "Expose thyself to
 what wretches feel," King Lear said, entering the mud
 and straw hovel of Poor Tom, "and show the heavens more
 just."
<p>
 Privilege and power, especially military power, is a
 dangerous narcotic. Violence destroys those who bear the
 brunt of its force, but also those who try to use it to
 become gods. Over 350 Palestinians have been killed ,
 many of them civilians, and over 1,000 have been wounded
 since the air attacks began on Saturday, Dec.27, 2008. Ehud Barak,
 Israel's defense minister, said Israel is engaged in a
 "war to the bitter end" against Hamas in Gaza. A
 war? Israel uses sophisticated attack jets and naval vessels
 to bomb densely crowded refugee camps and slums, to attack a
 population that has no air force, no air defense, no navy,
 no heavy weapons, no artillery units, no mechanized armor,
 no command and control, no army, and calls it a war. It is
 not a war. It is murder.
<p>
 The U.N. special rapporteur for human rights in the
 occupied Palestinian territory, former Princeton University
 law professor Richard Falk, has labeled what Israel is doing
 to the 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza "a crime
 against humanity." Falk, who is Jewish, has condemned
 the collective punishment of the Palestinians in Gaza as
 "a flagrant and massive violation of international
 humanitarian law as laid down in Article 33 of the Fourth
 Geneva Convention." He has asked for "the
 International Criminal Court to investigate the situation,
 and determine whether the Israeli civilian leaders and
 military commanders responsible for the Gaza siege should be
 indicted and prosecuted for violations of international
 criminal law."
<p>
 Falk's unflinching honesty has enraged Israel. He was
 banned from entering the country on Dec. 14 during his
 attempt to visit Gaza and the West Bank.
<p>
 "After being denied entry I was put in a holding room
 with about 20 others experiencing entry problems," he
 said. "At this point I was treated not as a U.N.
 representative, but as some sort of security threat,
 subjected to an inch-by-inch body search, and the most
 meticulous luggage inspection I have ever witnessed. I was
 separated from my two U.N. companions, who were allowed to
 enter Israel. At this point I was taken to the airport
 detention facility a mile or so away, required to put all my
 bags and cell phone in a room, taken to a locked, tiny room
 that had five other detainees, smelled of urine and filth,
 and was an unwelcome invitation to claustrophobia. I spent
 the next 15 hours so confined, which amounted to a cram
 course on the miseries of prison life, including dirty
 sheets, inedible food, and either lights that were too
 bright or darkness controlled from the guard office."
<p>
 The foreign press has been, like Falk, barred by Israel
 from entering Gaza to report on the destruction.
<p>
 Israel's stated aim of halting homemade rockets fired
 from Gaza into Israel remains unfulfilled. Gaza militants
 have fired more than 100 rockets and mortars into Israel,
 killing four people and wounding nearly two dozen more,
 since Israel unleashed its air assault. Israel has
 threatened to launch a ground assault and has called up
 6,500 army reservists. It has massed tanks on the Gaza
 border and declared the area a closed military zone.
<p>
 The rocket attacks by Hamas are, as Falk points out, also
 criminal violations of international law. But as Falk notes,
 "... such Palestinian behavior does not legalize
 Israel's imposition of a collective punishment of a
 life- and health-threatening character on the people of
 Gaza, and should not distract the U.N. or international
 society from discharging their fundamental moral and legal
 duty to render protection to the Palestinian people."
<p>
 "It is an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe that each
 day poses the entire 1.5 million Gazans to an unspeakable
 ordeal, to a struggle to survive in terms of their
 health," Falk has said of the ongoing Israeli blockade
 of Gaza. "This is an increasingly precarious condition.
 A recent study reports that 46 percent of all Gazan children
 suffer from acute anemia. There are reports that the sonic
 booms associated with Israeli overflights have caused
 widespread deafness, especially among children. Gazan
 children need thousands of hearing aids. Malnutrition is
 extremely high in a number of different dimensions and
 affects 75 percent of Gazans. There are widespread mental
 disorders, especially among young people without the will to
 live. Over 50 percent of Gazan children under the age of 12
 have been found to have no will to live."
<p>
 Before the air assaults, Gaza spent 12 hours a day without
 power, which can be a death sentence to the severely ill in
 hospitals. Most of Gaza is now without power. There are few
 drugs and little medicine, including no cancer or cystic
 fibrosis medication. Hospitals have generators but often
 lack fuel. Medical equipment, including one of Gaza's
 three CT scanners, has been destroyed by power surges and
 fluctuations. Medical staff cannot control the temperature
 of incubators for newborns. And Israel has revoked most exit
 visas, meaning some of those who need specialized care,
 including cancer patients and those in need of kidney
 dialysis, have died. Of the 230 Gazans estimated to have
 died last year because they were denied proper medical care,
 several spent their final hours at Israeli crossing points
 where they were refused entry into Israel. The statistics
 gathered on children-half of Gaza's population is under
 the age of 17-are increasingly grim. About 45 percent of
 children in Gaza have iron deficiency from a lack of fruit
 and vegetables, and 18 percent have stunted growth.
<p>
 "It is macabre," Falk said of the blockade.
 "I don't know of anything that exactly fits this
 situation. People have been referring to the Warsaw ghetto
 as the nearest analog in modern times."
<p>
 "There is no structure of an occupation that endured
 for decades and involved this kind of oppressive
 circumstances," the rapporteur added. "The
 magnitude, the deliberateness, the violations of
 international humanitarian law, the impact on the health,
 lives and survival and the overall conditions warrant the
 characterization of a crime against humanity. This
 occupation is the direct intention by the Israeli military
 and civilian authorities. They are responsible and should be
 held accountable."
<p>
 The point of the Israeli attack, ostensibly, is to break
 Hamas, the radical Islamic group that was elected to power
 in 2007. But Hamas has repeatedly proposed long-term truces
 with Israel and offered to negotiate a permanent truce.
 During the last cease-fire, established through Egyptian
 intermediaries in July, Hamas upheld the truce although
 Israel refused to ease the blockade. It was Israel that, on
 Nov. 4, initiated an armed attack that violated the
 truce and killed six Palestinians. It was only then that
 Hamas resumed firing rockets at Israel.
<p>
 "This is a crime of survival," Falk said of the
 rocket attacks by Palestinians. "Israel has put the
 Gazans in a set of circumstances where they either have to
 accept whatever is imposed on them or resist in any way
 available to them. That is a horrible dilemma to impose upon
 a people. This does not alleviate the Palestinians, and
 Gazans in particular, for accountability for doing these
 acts involving rocket fire, but it also imposes some
 responsibility on Israel for creating these
 circumstances."
<p>
 Israel seeks to break the will of the Palestinians to
 resist. The Israeli government has demonstrated little
 interest in diplomacy or a peaceful solution. The rapid
 expansion of Jewish settlements on the West Bank is an
 effort to thwart the possibility of a two-state solution by
 gobbling up vast tracts of Palestinian real estate. Israel
 also appears to want to thrust the impoverished Gaza Strip
 onto Egypt. Dozens of tunnels had been the principal means
 for food and goods, connecting Gaza to Egypt. Israel had
 permitted the tunnels to operate, most likely as part of an
 effort to further cut Gaza off from Israel. This ended,
 however, on Sunday when Israeli fighter jets bombed over 40
 tunnels along Gaza's border with Egypt. The Israeli
 military said that the tunnels, on the Gaza side of the
 border, were used for smuggling weapons, explosives and
 fugitives. Egypt has sealed its border and refused to let
 distraught Palestinians enter its territory.
<p>
 "Israel, all along, has not been prepared to enter
 into diplomatic process that gives the Palestinians a viable
 state," Falk said. "They [the Israelis] feel time
 is on their side. They feel they can create enough facts on
 the ground so people will come to the conclusion a viable
 state cannot emerge."
<p>
 The use of terror and hunger to break a hostile population
 is one of the oldest forms of warfare. I watched the Bosnian
 Serbs employ the same tactic in Sarajevo. Those who
 orchestrate such sieges do not grasp the terrible rage born
 of long humiliation, indiscriminate violence and abuse. A
 father or a mother whose child dies because of a lack of
 vaccines or proper medical care does not forget. A boy whose
 ill grandmother dies while detained at an Israel checkpoint
 does not forget. A family that loses a child in an airstrike
 does not forget. All who endure humiliation, abuse and the
 murder of family members do not forget. This rage becomes a
 virus within those who, eventually, stumble out into the
 daylight. Is it any wonder that 71 percent of children
 interviewed at a school in Gaza recently said they wanted to
 be a "martyr"?
<p>
 The Israelis in Gaza, like the American forces in Iraq and
 Afghanistan, are foolishly breeding the next generation of
 militants and Islamic radicals. Jihadists, enraged by the
 injustices done by Israel and the United States, seek to
 carry out reciprocal acts of savagery, even at the cost of
 their own lives. The violence unleashed on Palestinian
 children will, one day, be the violence unleashed on Israeli
 children. This is the tragedy of Gaza. This is the tragedy
 of Israel.</font>
