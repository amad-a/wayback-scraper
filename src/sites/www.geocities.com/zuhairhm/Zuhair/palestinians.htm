There was nothing they could do when the British Empire created the Palestine Mandate. There was nothing they could do when the British Cabinet, for reasons historians still argue about, decided Palestine would make a nice national home for European Jews when and if the British Empire ever decided to give up its occupation of Palestine."

In 1947-48, the Zionist paramilitary terror organizations that would later become the Israeli army carried out a premeditated ethnic cleansing of Palestine during and after the British Mandate, they ethnically cleansed more than 400 villages and 13 cities, forcing out almost 800,000 indigenous Palestinians, systematically committing tens of massacres. That ethnic cleansing, referred to by Palestinians as the Nakba, is the reason Gaza is one of the most populated areas in the world, as it is populated by many of those refugees and their descendants. Israel, the US and most of the Western world would like to expunge that 1948 crime from the record. The resistance today in Gaza is the revolt of a people that refuses to be erased.

<p>The ethnic cleansing of 1948 is an ongoing reality that has been unfolding for over 60 years, until today: ongoing theft of the remaining Palestinian land and water, demolition of thousands of homes, the making of the Gaza Strip and Palestinian cities into concentration camps surrounded by an eight-meter-high cement wall and electrical fences, inside which reign unemployment, poverty, hunger and despair, in addition to the mass incarceration of three generations of Palestinians (currently the population of Palestinians in Israeli prisons is more than 12,000). On the flip side of the steady decimation of the indigenous Palestinian people, Israel, with US and European support, imported to Palestine one million immigrants, mostly Europeans, during the 1990s. Land theft and colonization were carried out under a fake discourse of peace, promoted by a fake Israeli peace movement and non-governmental organizations financed by the US and EU, using the Oslo agreement of the mid-1990s as tools for the complete elimination of Palestine from the map.

<p>Edward Said's words  may have been written in 2001, but the thrust of his message is no less resounding: '. . .  no matter the occasion, no matter the question, no matter the newspaper or TV or radio journalist, every question must first be answered with a few basic points about the military occupation . . . This is the source of violence, this is the source of the main problems, and it is the reason Israel can never have real peace. Our entire political position must be based on ending the occupation and this must take precedence over any and every other consideration. . .'  It is the occupation, the occupation and the occupation over and over again.

Taxpayers are spending over $1 billion to send refined fuel to the Israeli military -- at a time when Israel doesn't need it and America does.<br><font size"5"> 
By Robert Bryce</font>
<p><font color="FFCC00" size="5">"It's well known that the U.S. Supplies the Israelis with much of their military hardware. Over the past few decades, the U.S. has provided about $53 billion in military aid to Israel. What's not well known is that since 2004, U.S. Taxpayers have paid to supply over 500 million gallons of refined oil products -- worth about $1.1 billion �- to the Israeli military. While a handful of countries get motor fuel from the U.S., they receive only a fraction of the fuel that Israel does -- fuel now being used by Israeli fighter jets, helicopters and tanks to battle Hamas.
<p>According to documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, between 2004 and 2007 the U.S. Defense Department gave $818 million worth of fuel to the Israeli military. The total amount was 479 million gallons, the equivalent of about 66 gallons per Israeli citizen. In 2008, an additional $280 million in fuel was given to the Israeli military, again at U.S. Taxpayers''s expense. The U.S. Has even paid the cost of shipping the fuel from U.S. Refineries to ports in Israel.
<p>What's more, Israel does not need the U.S. Handout. Its own recently privatized refineries, located at Haifa and Ashdod, could supply all of the fuel needed by the Israeli military. Those same refineries are now producing and selling jet fuel and other refined products on the open market. But rather than purchase lower-cost jet fuel from its own refineries, the Israeli military is using U.S. Taxpayer money to buy and ship large quantities of fuel from U.S. Refineries.
<p>In short, U.S. taxpayers are paying for U.S. energy companies to buy Arab crude, ship it across the Atlantic to refineries in the U.S., refine it, and then ship it back across the Atlantic so that the Israel Defense Force can use it in its wars."</font>

the expulsion of some 750,000 Palestinians, or 80 per cent the native 
population of Palestine, from the borders of the newly established Jewish state.
<p>Golda Meir, Israeli Prime Minister, considered by Israelis as a great leader and by others as one of history's great killers, disputed the facts, she said:<font color="#FFCC00"> "It was not as though there was a Palestinian people in Palestine and we came and threw them out and took their country away from them.

<p><font color="#FF0000">Israel's 700 km long "security" wall is being built 80% on Palestinian territory, and will trap more than 50,000 Palestinians in "no mans land" on the "Israeli" side of the wall. According to the International Court of Justice the wall is illegal and should be dismantled immediately.

<br>By Manuel Valenzuela<br>Wednesday, January 23, 2008
</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"> "The desire to expand borders and territory, an addiction to greed and the aspiration to cleanse Palestine of Arabs manufactures in the Israeli government a policy of wicked objectives bursting with cold and calculated cruelty. Thus, the ill-treatment of Palestinians by Israel makes life so unbearable, so hard and depressing that it is a triumph of the human spirit that so many remain, unwavering and strong, even as the weight of utter wickedness is enforced generation to generation.
<p>  Living in the occupied territories is like living in Warsaw ghettos of the 1930's and South African Bantustans. It is akin to dwelling in Indian reservations, those cesspools of nothingness in the lands of America from where millions rotted away their once vibrant existence. Gaza and the West Bank are squalors of humanity acting as giant prisons, where dense refugee camps are considered cities, their perimeters encircled by fences, walls, Israeli tanks and the ever watchful eyes of trigger-friendly snipers. Enormous prisons within occupied lands, preventing contiguity, freedom of movement and any semblance of a sovereign state are the true definition of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
<p>  To live inside these vast prisons and internment camps is to struggle with the daily existence of Israeli suffocation and dehumanization that you know is purposeful as it is deliberate. It is to feel Israeli claws strangulating your esophagus, denying you of the air to breathe and the sustenance you need to survive. Life under Israel's merciless rule means that sixty to seventy percent of your people are unemployed, unable to provide for their families, as commerce is almost non-existent and access to Israeli business almost impossible. It is to live in worlds of child undernourishment and lack of healthcare, as Israel's policies make indigent millions of families who desperately need to feed and treat their children."</font> <font color="#FFCC00">End of quote.</font>

<p><center><font color="FF0000">The following is a quotation from a letter to<br> President Barak H. Obama<br> from Ambassador Khalil Makkawi<br> 
President<br>Worldwide Alumni Association of the<br> American University of Beirut<br> (WAAAUB)<br> January 27, 2009 :
<p>"As you well know, the conflict in Palestine, which is the core issue of the Middle East conflict, has gone unresolved for sixty years. Scores of UN resolutions, and several accords that were brokered by various powers, including the United States, were ignored. The two-state solution which was advocated by the United States is being rendered impossible by Israel�s continuing occupation of Palestinian territories and the expansion of its settlements. No amount of roadblocks and separation walls can provide security for Israel as long as this situation continues. With the inflammation of the conflict, we fear that an equitable solution will recede even further from our grasp, posing insurmountable challenges for securing peace and stability for our entire region."</font> 
<p>The Jewish settlements were not perceived to be a security requirement. They and the ideologues behind them testified, very clearly, to an intention to displace the occupied population. This caused and justified an increasingly bitter resistance. There were increasingly vicious attempts to repress it, resulting in more and more damage to Palestinian lands, cities, and individuals. Border closures stifled employment opportunities in Israel; tanks ripped up roads and broke sewer lines beneath them; curfews and, above all, checkpoints made anything remotely resembling normal economic life impossible.
<p>Israel has divided the West Bank into besieged cantons, worked diligently to increase the number of Jewish settlers in East Jerusalem (while stripping Palestinian Jerusalemites of their residency rights in the city) and turned Gaza into a virtual prison. 
<p><font color="#FF0000">The only difference between modern American/Israeli fascism and classic Nazism is the modern capability to control all information and suppress the truth.</font>
<p>Palestinians have seen their putative state in the West Bank sliced away by settlements, army posts, military zones, fences and Israeli-only roads that cut the territory into enclaves in which 2.5 million Palestinians are confined, their movements heavily curtailed. A map of the West Bank recently published by the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs shows that the Israeli system of settlements and protective infrastructure has rendered 40 per cent of the West Bank off-limits to Palestinians.
<p>Israel is the illegitimate child of ethnic nationalism. The inhabitants of Palestine had every reason to oppose its establishment by any means necessary. No one is required to submit to a sovereignty from which they are excluded, much less a sovereignty arrogated to one ethnic group and excluding all others. Given the life-and-death powers of the proposed state and the intentions of its proponents to maintain ethnic super-macy within its borders, the Palestinians were justified in taking the project as a mortal threat, and, therefore, to resist it by any means necessary.
<p>Indeed, as so often happens, an ethnic nationalism born of persecution became a vehicle for bigotry, insolent self-righteousness, sadism, fanatical nonsense, and naked greed.
<p><font color="#FF0000">Israel can maintain a functional democracy only through curbing the Jewishness and Jewish fundamentalism of the state.</font>
<p> Israel wants recognition of Israel as a state for the Jewish people only. George W. Bush has publicly agreed to that. This recognition is meant to bolster Israel's position that rejects the return of Palestinian refugees to areas inside the Green Line - the border before the 1967 Six-Day War.  
<p> There is a great divide in Israel between Jews and non-Jews. This gap in rights and respect is consciously perpetrated by government policy and even elder statesmen. This divide and discrimination is clearly expressed well in relation to the groups of non-Jewish citizens, (estimates have cited 250,000-300,000) who immigrated to Israel from the former USSR under the law of return, vis-�-vis the Arab Israelis, who were there for many generations before the creation of the Jewish State, and who are marginalized, underprivileged and their national rights violated by mainstream Israel. 
<p>The brutalities of the settler movement and its sponsors are the work of "haves" who have got it in their head that God wants them to have more, and to crush, slowly and painfully, all those who stand in the way of their fifth-rate vision. Those spoilt brats believe they know exactly what God and Abraham said to each other in the Bronze Age.
<p> The lies, obfuscations, and self-deceiving nonsense that sustain Israel's occupation-something it could end tomorrow-cost Jewish as well as Palestinian blood.
<p>Over nearly 40 years, the Israeli occupation has been characterized by, 
amongst others, the practice of extra-judicial executions, land 
confiscation, arbitrary arrest and detention, and house demolitions. Over 
the past year, not only have these violations persisted with alarming 
tenacity, but the economic boycott of the elected Palestinian government has 
crippled the Palestinian economy, and severely damaged the provision of 
education and health services. The resulting violations of the rights to 
education, health and employment are more severe than they have ever been, 
deepening poverty and destroying social cohesion.
<p>Of the numerous human rights violation to which Palestinians are subjected, 
none is more pervasive than the severe restrictions placed upon Palestinian 
movement within the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). Movement 
restrictions limit access to education, employment, health services, and 
agricultural land, and have economic and social consequences beyond simply 
hindering travel. Movement restrictions are most commonly enforced through 
permanent and 'flying' military checkpoints, which are often the location of 
the ill-treatment, assault and, in some instances, killing of Palestinian 
civilians. Since 2002 the construction of the Annexation Wall in the OPT has 
increased land confiscation within the draconian regime associated with 
movement restrictions in the OPT.
<p>At present, 2007, as a result of Israeli occupation and the accompanying restrictions on movement, the Palestinian economy is in free-fall. Fully 70% of Palestinians are now living in poverty, according to UN calculations, a figure which rises to 80% in Gaza. Over half of all Palestinians are now unable to cover their families' daily food needs without relying on external aid - a scandal in such a rich and fertile land.

<p>The occupier imposes economic strangulation and collective punishment by restricting free movement; enclosing population centres, closing borders, barring most of your people from working inside 'its country', imposing regular curfews, roadblocks, checkpoints, electric fences and separation walls. All whilst continuing to build new settlements in the Occupied Territories (on your land in your country) violating the Geneva Conventions prohibiting an occupier from settling its population on conquered land.

<p>NEXT MONTH, May 2008, Israel will celebrate its 60th anniversary.
<p>Israel, since the beginning of "Negotiations" with the Palestinian Authority, which were a farce to start with, -like actors on the stage drinking from empty glasses, and all parties pretend that there are negotiations going on, they meet, embrace, smile, pose for photographs, convene joint teams, hold press conferences, make declarations - <font color="#FF0000">nothing, absolutely nothing, really happens.</font>
<p>What is the farce for? Each of the participants has his own reasons: Olmert needs an agenda to fill the void. George Bush, a lame duck who leaves behind him nothing but ruins in every field, wants to present at least one achievement, fictitious as it may be. Poor Mahmoud Abbas, whose continued existence depends on his ability to show some political achievement for his people, clings to this illusion with all his remaining strength. And so the farce goes on.<p>  <font color="#FF0000">Meaningless negotiations for a meaningless agreement.</font>  
<p>There is no escape from the inevitable conclusion: the Israeli government is not working for peace. It does not want peace. And, also, that there is no effective parliamentary opposition pressing for peace, nor any pressure from the media.
<p>Both governments, the Israeli and the Palestinian, are too weak to make peace. Everything must be postponed until strong leaderships emerge on both sides.
<p>When two neighboring peoples make peace, they fix, first of all, the border between them. And that is precisely what the Israeli establishment opposes, because it negates the basic ethos of the Zionist enterprise. That is the reason for David Ben-Gurion's refusal to include in the Declaration of Independence of the new State of Israel any mention of borders. He did not intend for a minute to be satisfied with the borders fixed by the United Nations General Assembly resolution of November 29, 1947. All his successors had the same approach. Even the Oslo agreements delineated "zones" but did not fix a border.
<p><font color="#FF0000">In this respect, too, Israel resembles the United States, which was founded along the Eastern seaboard and did not rest until it had reached the Western shores on the other side of the continent. The incessant stream of mass immigration from Europe flowed on westwards, breaching all borders and violating all agreements, exterminating the Native Americans, starting a war against Mexico, conquering Texas, invading Central America and Cuba. The slogan that drove them on and justified all their actions was coined in 1845 by John O'Sullivan: "Manifest Destiny".</font>
<p> The US and their European satellites are boycotting the Palestinian government and starving the Palestinian population. They have set three conditions for lifting the blockade: 
<p>   1. the Palestinians must recognize the right of Israel to exist (without defining its borders, of course),<font color="#FF0000"> but the Israeli government is not required to recognize the right of a Palestinian state to exist at all.</font>
<p>Hamas has announced its support for the establishment of a Palestinian state bounded by the June 1967 borders - meaning: next to Israel and not in place of Israel.
<p>   2. The Palestinians must put an end to "terrorism",<font color="#FF0000"> but the Israeli government is not required to stop its military operations in the Palestinian territories and stop the building of settlements. The "roadmap" does indeed say so, but that has been completely ignored by everybody, including the Americans.</font>
<p>   3. The Palestinians must undertake to fulfill the agreements,<font color="#FF0000"> but no such undertaking is required from the Israeli government, which has broken almost all provision of the Oslo agreement. Among others: the opening of the "safe passages" between Gaza and the West Bank, the carrying out of the third "redeployment" (withdrawal from Palestinian territories), the treatment of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as one single territory, etc etc.</font>
<p>Jimmy Carter: "This gross mistreatment of the Palestinians in Gaza was escalated dramatically by Israel, with United States backing, after political candidates representing Hamas won a majority of seats in the Palestinian Authority parliament in 2006. The election was unanimously judged to be honest and fair by all international observers.--Israel and the US refused to accept the right of Palestinians to form a unity government with Hamas and Fatah and now, after internal strife, Hamas alone controls Gaza. Forty-one of the 43 victorious Hamas candidates who lived in the West Bank have been imprisoned by Israel, plus an additional 10 who assumed positions in the short-lived coalition cabinet."
<p><font color="#FFCC00">I quote Michael Neumann, professor of philosophy at Trent University in Ontario, Canada, in his book "The Case Against Israel", published 2005:</font>
<p>"For an extended account of daily life in one area, Gaza, the reader is referred to the work of Israeli journalist Amira Hass, Drinking the Sea at Gaza: Days and nights in a land under Siege. Here is a brief description of their impact from Amos Elon:
<p> In Gaza Strip some of the well-established, prospering Jewish settlements are only a few hundred meters away from the vast Palestinian refugee camps, populated by third- and fourth-generation Palestinian refugees. In five minutes a visitor might feel as if he was passing from Southern California to Bangladesh-through barbed-wire entanglements, past watchtowers, searchlights, machine-gun positions, and fortified roadblocks: a bizarre and chilling sight.
<p> The Palestinians are infuriated as well by seeing their olive groves uprooted or burned down by settlers while their water faucets go dry and their ancestral land reserves and scarce water resources are taken over for the use of settlers who luxuriate nearby in their swimming pools and consume five times as much as the average Palestinian. The settlements themselves occupy less than 20 percent of the West Bank, but through a network of so-called regional councils they control planning and environmental policy for approximately 40 percent of the West Bank, according to figures recently published by B'tzelem, the Israeli human rights organization.
<p>What makes the Israeli position particularly indefensible is its utter gratuitousness. There is no conceivable reason for Israel to promote the settlements that have been the cause of so much misery. The settler movement is built on pseudo-Biblical foolishness, bad history, creed, and-worse-a sort of racist messianism that deserves no tolerance, consideration, or respect. 
<p>           God meant the Promised Land to symbolize the peace and holiness of heaven. Yet, primarily because Zionist Jews have flouted His law, expelling most Palestinians and ramming an unbiblical occupation down the throat of the Arab world, the Middle East has been turned into a living hell of discord.
<p>"Compared to the power of this myth, does it really matter that the Exodus from Egypt never took place? Thousands of Egyptian documents deciphered in recent years leave no room for doubt: the exodus of masses of people, as described in the Bible, or anything remotely like it, just never happened. These documents, which cover in the finest detail every period and every part of Canaan during this epoch prove beyond any doubt that there was no "Conquest of Canaan" and no kingdom of David and Solomon. For a hundred years, Zionist archeologists have devoted tireless efforts to finding even a single piece of evidence to support the Biblical narrative, all to no avail."

<p> "The modern Jewish myth has it that almost all the Jews are descendents of the Jewish community that lived in Palestine 2000 years ago and was driven out by the Romans in the year 70 AD. That is, of course, baseless. The "Expulsion from the Country" is a religious myth: God was angry with the Jews because of their sins and exiled them from His country. But the Romans were not in the habit of moving populations, and there is clear evidence that a great part of the Jewish population in the country remained here after the Zealots' Revolt and after the Bar-Kochba uprising, and that most Jews lived outside the country long before that."
<p>Israel could have not only peace but vastly increased security tomorrow if it chooses: (it has all the options, and the Palestinians none). The fussing about negotiations, trust, and hatred are nothing but self-deceiving excuses for more bloodshed.
<p> <font color="#FF0000">Given these circumstances it would seem that no one, Jewish or non-Jewish, should support Israel</font>."

<p>Uri Avnery: "It is easy to put the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the South African bed, since the similarities between the symptoms are obvious. The Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories has been going on for 40 years now, and almost 60 years have passed since the Naqba - the armed conflict of 1948 in which the State of Israel came into being and in which more than half the Palestinians lost their homes and land. Relations between the settlers and the Palestinians are in many ways reminiscent of apartheid; and even in Israel proper, the Arab citizens are far from real equality."

<p> In 1994, an Israeli terrorist Dr. Baruch Goldstein, a Jewish American Zionist physician decided to materialize the dream of the typical Zionist movement of annihilating the Arab existence in Palestine. Dr. Baruch Goldstein prepared for the move. It was during Ramadan when Dr. Goldstein decided to execute his old plan of vengeance. He opened fire in Al Ibrahimi Mosque in the West Bank town of Hebron, killing 29 people and injuring 47. In response, the Israelis closed the mosque for six months. When it reopened, the Palestinians discovered the mosque had been divided - half for the Muslims and half for the Jews - as if to reward the killer for his perpetration.

there; dispossession is the name of the game. With no functioning economy,

<p>"For nearly 60 years, the dispossession of the Palestinian people, through
the creation of the state of Israel has continued unabated and all the
heartfelt words used to reaffirm their inalienable rights to
self-determination have rung hollow. Their right of return affirmed in UN
resolution 194 has been ignored, rendering now nearly 5 million stateless
Palestinians permanent refugees. Countless UN resolutions have been passed
declaring Israel�s  40 year occupation of the remaining 22% of historic
Palestine, namely the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, illegal but none
have been implemented. A litany of human rights abuses by Israel against the
Palestinians have gone uncensored. The flagrant land theft carried out by
Israel through its 200 illegal settlements with some 450,000 illegal
settlers and the continued construction of the wall judged illegal by the
international court of justice makes a mockery of any adherence to the rule

<p>"International Jewish supremacism corrupts humanity through Hollywood and the mainstream media it dominates. Its media promotes immorality, pornography, homosexuality, abortion, evolution, violence, drugs and alcohol, anti-Christianity and every form of liberal secular humanism. Dual-loyalty, pro-Zionist Jews pervade the White House and Congress, goading America into Mid-East wars in defense of Israel. Zionist leaders encourage sacrifice of thousands of American lives to rid the Mid-East of Israel�s enemies.

<p><font color="#009900"> Israel  recently has been condemned by Amnesty International and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. 
<p>On Dec. 7, 1987, the U.N. General Assembly voted 153-2 (with one abstention) to approve a resolution that condemned international terrorism. The two nations rejecting the resolution were the United States and Israel.
<p>General Assembly Resolution 42/159 concerned measures to prevent international terrorism, deploring the continuation of all terrorist acts. The resolution also urges all states to <u>contribute to the progressive elimination of the causes underlying international terrorism and to pay special attention to all situations, including colonialism, racism, situations involving mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, study the underlying political and economic causes of terrorism</u>, convene a conference to define terrorism and to differentiate it from the struggle of people for national liberation.

<p>From the U.S./Israeli point of view, violence committed by Israel against Palestinians is defensive. So, Israel's military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, routine use of torture, arbitrary demolition of homes, bulldozing olive trees, confiscating land and political assassinations are not examples of terrorism. These Israeli pogroms are simply necessary for defense!  Palestinian violence in resistance, though always at a far lower level, is terrorism.
<p>What can this self-defense possibly mean after 39 years of occupation? How can actions designed to preserve the occupation regime be termed defensive? The only legitimate defense is that of Israel's legal borders, from within its borders, not by occupying territories and denying the freedom of an entire people.
<p>Israel systematically bulldozed homes occupied by people who have no rights in the land where they have lived since before history was written down. Human beings who have no chance of living decent dignified lives. These people, these human beings with hopes and dreams and eyes that 
see and hearts that feel and hands that touch, these human beings are 
persecuted and impoverished because they aren't Jewish. Dozens of families were forced out of their homes in mid-winter, families left without a roof over
their head and without a living, seventy homes then razed before their eyes in one day, just to serve someone's expansionist politics.

<p> The homes of people resisting the occupation, even by peaceful means, have 
been demolished sometimes with only a few hours notice for the occupants to 
get out. In May 2002, an estimated 10,000 Palestinians were left homeless 
when their homes were damaged or totally destroyed. Israel has destroyed some 4,100 homes in the Occupied Territories in the past four years.
<p>Since fighting began Thursday 28 September 2000, some 16,000 people have been made homeless in Rafah, many of them during a large-scale army incursion in May, 2004, Human Rights Watch report said. "We've seen the piece by piece destruction of up to 10 percent of Rafah," said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. Roth called the destruction gratuitous, saying the army was retaliating for the killing of five soldiers on the patrol road along the border.
<p><font color="#FF0000">There is no doubt that the destruction wrought by Israel over the last five years - the demolition of homes (some 4600 between 2000 and 2004), schools, roads, factories, workshops, hospitals, mosques and greenhouses, the razing of agricultural fields, the uprooting of trees, the confinement of the population and the denial of access to education and health services as a consequence of Israeli roadblocks and checkpoints - has been ruinous for Palestinians, especially those in the Gaza Strip.
<p>Since beginning of the second Intifada hundreds of thousands of olive and fruit trees have been uprooted, cut and burnt down, throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The majority of them due to the "stripping" operations in the Gaza Strip along with the construction of the security barrier at the West Bank. Many thousands of olive and fruit trees of villages near settlements were destroyed by settlers who cut or burnt them down. The security forces in charge repeatedly failed to demonstrate even the smallest of efforts in attempt to prevent this vandalism.

<p>Meanwhile, the soul-and-body destroying situation in Palestine 
worsens all 
the time. There seems no force capable of stopping Sharon and 
Mofaz, who 
bellow their defiance to the whole world. We forbid, we punish, we 
ban, we 
break, we destroy. The torrent of unbroken violence against an 
entire people 
continues.
<p>There are about 11,000 Palestinians detained in miserable Israeli prisons, many of them for long years without trial. A large number of them are on unlimited hunger strike, for more than 10 days now. The Israelis have lifted medical help just to put pressure and punish them. Israel's public security minister, Tzahi Hanegbi, like Mr Naveh a member of the rightwing Likud party of the prime minister, Ariel Sharon's, said last week he did not care if the prisoners starved to death. The World is in complete SILENCE...Human Rights!!!
<p>Sharon and those who speak on his behalf stated that the aim of the <a href="gazanfiasco.htm"><font color="#FF0000">"Disengagement Plan"</a></font> in Gaza Strip
is to "freeze" the peace process for decades, put peace in
"formaldehyde", prevent forever the creation of  a Palestinian state,
destroy the elected Palestinian leadership and extend the settlements all
over the West Bank. Sharon builds the Separation Fence, enlarges the settlements in the West Bank, initiates provocations, assassinates, kills, bombs and arrests the Palestinians.

<p>A new report (Oct. 2002) by Amnesty International contends that Israeli forces committed war crimes in Jenin and Nablus this spring during a large-scale offensive in the West Bank, killing Palestinians unlawfully, blocking medical care, using people as human shields and bulldozing houses with residents inside. In Nablus, again on April 6, 2002, eight members of a single family were killed, including three children, their pregnant mother and an 85-year-old grandfather, when their house was bulldozed.

<p><center><font color="#FF0000" size="6">"Jews brandished the story of the holocaust<br> and erased the peaceful Palestinian population in 1948"</font>
<p><font size="5">Yeshayahu Leibowitz, the philosopher who was an observant orthodox Jew, said:<font color="#FF0000"> �The Jewish religion died 200 years ago. Now there is nothing that unifies the Jews around the world apart from the Holocaust.�</font>
<p>The Holocaust narrative makes Jews the ultimate victim no matter how they dispossess or dehumanize or ethnically cleanse the indigenous Palestinian people. The Holocaust narrative allows Yad Vashem, Holocaust museum, to repeat the mantra of "Never Forget" while it sits on Palestinian Arab lands stolen from Ein Karem and overlooking the unmarked graves of Palestinians massacred by Jewish terrorists at<a href="deiryasinday.htm"><font color="FF0000">  Deir Yassin.</font></a> 
<p>The murder of millions of innocent Jews in Europe, not America, was among the 
many genocidal Holocausts in history. Jews were murdered, their properties 
confiscated, and were scapegoated for their faith and ethnicity. In the XXth century, the Zionists sold innocent Jewish families to Hitler and the western �democracies�,<font color="#FF0000"> as cash for buying Palestine as the owners of that colony.</font>
 <p><font color="FF0000">"The Holocaust is the secular religion of the Western world, complete with punishment and prison sentences for heretics who reject it. It is an “other god” that has been raised above all other religions, including the Christian religion and the concept of God itself, and in this sense it truly is a form of anti-Christian idol worship." </font>
<p>As Arthur Koestler was to write: the "bloodshed" at<a href="deiryasinday.htm"><font color="FF0000">  Deir Yassin.</font></a>  Deir Yasin was <b>"the psychologically decisive factor in the spectacular exodus of the Arabs from the Holy Land and the creation of Palestinian refugee problem"</b> Jacques Reynier agreed. He wrote that after the massacre, and because of the publicity it received, "the exodus (of Palestinians) began and bcame nearly general"
<p>Holocaust revisionists believe that the Jewish power will collapse if the Holocaust narrative is undermined.
<p><u><font color="#FF0000" size="5"> Tragically 
and ironically, Jews in Israel are propagating the same crimes against 
innocent Palestinians while once again the world is SILENT, but this time 
America is providing the money, weapons, and protective Vetoes in the United 
Nation to directly support Israel's Jews in their "Palestinian Holocaust".</u></font>
<p><font color="#FFCC00">President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran says: our proposal is...give a piece of your ground in Europe, in the United States, in Canada or in Alaska so that they can create their state."  He wants Israel relocated to Europe because the Holocaust occurred in Europe by fair skinned Europeans, not in Palestine by Semites.   Ahmadinejad has both guts and a wry sense of humor, and he seems to be as popular in his country as Hugo Chavez is in Venezuela.   Why do these nice folks hate USA?

<p><center><font color="#FF0000" size="6">Analogy:</font> 
<p></u> According to Ward Churchill, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado, the reduction of the North American Indian population from an estimated 12 million in 1500 to barely 237,000 in 1900 represents a "vast genocide . . . , the most sustained on record." By the end of the 19th century, writes David E. Stannard, a historian at the University of Hawaii, native Americans had undergone the "worst human Holocaust the world had ever witnessed, roaring across two continents non-stop for four centuries and consuming the lives of countless tens of millions of people."
<p><center>Another quote, (Ward Churchill):
<p>"I am not a "defender" of the September 11 attacks, but simply pointing out that if U.S. foreign policy results in massive death and destruction abroad, we cannot feign innocence when some of that destruction is returned. I have never said that people "should" engage in armed attacks on the United States, but that such attacks are a natural and unavoidable consequence of unlawful U.S. policy. As Martin Luther King, quoting Robert F. Kennedy, said, "Those who make peaceful change impossible make violent change inevitable."

Mel Gibson's film "THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST" is the news of the month!
It should remind us that the brutality of 1st Century Judea is little
different from 21st Century Israel.
As millions of us watch the torture of Jesus, reenacted, we should not
forget that thousands of men and some women are still being tortured
just as brutally in the same land where the Prince of Peace walked,
and where He sacrificed himself for the sins of mankind.  Did he not
intend that His followers end brutality?
<p>"The barbaric practice of extracting confessions from "detainees" by
torture has always been used in Israel and was legitimatised in
Israel by the 1994 Landau Decision.  Human rights groups have fought
against the use of torture for some 50 years, and it has been the
subject of many UN resolutions, including one that declared Israel to
be a "Terrorist State."</font>

<p>Seven years after the Declaration of Principles in September 1993 "Israel has security and administrative control" of most of the West Bank and 20 per cent of the Gaza Strip. It has been able to double the number of Jewish  settlers in 10 years, to enlarge the settlements, to continue its discriminatory policy of cutting back water quotas for 3.7 million Palestinians to 17 % and giving 83 % of the water to the Israelis (an Israeli gets 12 times more water than a Palestinian), to prevent Palestinian development in most of the area of the West Bank, and to seal an entire nation into 220 ghettos, disarmed and controlled by the Israeli army, imprisoned in a network of bypass roads meant for Jews only.

<p><center><font color="#FFCC00" size="6"><u>Sharon's plan!</font></u>
<p>  "His aim was: to establish a Jewish state, as large as possible, free of non-Jews. That could lead to the conclusion that the ethnic cleansing, begun by Ben-Gurion in 1948, when half the Palestinians were deprived of their homes and land, must be completed. Sharon's career began shortly after, when he was appointed to lead the undercover commando Unit 101, whose murderous actions beyond the borders were designed mainly to prevent the refugees from infiltrating back to their villages. 
However, Sharon became convinced quite early that another wholesale ethnic cleansing was impossible in the foreseeable future (barring some unforeseeable international event changing conditions altogether.)
In default of this option, Sharon believed that Israel must annex all the areas between the Mediterranean and the Jordan without a dense Palestinian population. Already decades ago, he prepared a map that he showed proudly to local and foreign personalities in order to convert them to his views.
According to this map, Israel will annex the areas along the pre-1967 border as well as the Jordan valley, up to the "back of the mountain" (an expression particularly dear to Sharon). It will also annex several East-West strips to connect the Jordan valley with the Green Line. In these territories that are marked for annexation, Sharon created a dense net of settlements. That was his principal endeavor throughout the last thirty years, in all his diverse positions - Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Industry and Trade, Minister of Defense, Minister of Housing,  Foreign Minister, Minister of Infrastructure, and Prime Minister - and this work is going on at this minute.
The areas with a dense Palestinian population, Sharon intended to hand over to Palestinian self-government. He was determined to remove from them all the settlements that were set up there without thinking. This way, eight or nine Palestinian enclaves would have come into being, cut off from each other, each one surrounded by settlers and Israeli army installations. He did not care whether these would be called a "Palestinian state". His recent use of this term is an example of his ability to adapt himself, outwardly and verbally, to changing situations.
The Gaza strip is one of these enclaves. That is the real significance of the uprooting of the settlements and the withdrawal of the Israeli army. It is the first stage in the realization of the map: this small area, with a dense Palestinian population of a million and a quarter, was turned over to the Palestinians. The Israeli land, sea and air forces surround the strip almost completely. The very existence of its inhabitants depends at all times on the mercy of Israel, which controls all entrances and exits (except the Rafah crossing into Egypt, which is monitored by Israel from afar.) Israel can cut off the water and electricity supply at a moment's notice. Sharon intended to create the same situation in Hebron, Ramallah, Nablus, Jenin and the other areas."

<p>Unfortunately for America and Israel, Arab satellite television has been beaming
the truth about the situation on an around-the-clock basis, and the people in the Arab World know who is being killed and who is being besieged.
<p>"An Arab child sees on TV an old woman lamenting the demolition of her home. He sees on the walls in the street the photos of the martyred heroes, sons of his neighborhood, who have sacrificed their lives for their people and country. He hears what has happened to his cousin who was murdered by the evil Jews. He hears from his father that he cannot buy meat or eggs, because the Jews are not allowing him to work and put food on the table. At home there is no water for most of the day. Mother tells about grandpa and grandma, who have been languishing for 60 years in a miserable refugee camp in Lebanon. He knows that his family were driven out from their village in what became Israel and that the Jews are living there now. The hero of his class is the boy who jumped on a passing Israeli tank, or who dared to throw a stone from a distance of 10 meters at a soldier who was pointing a gun at him."
<p> Prince Abdullah, of Saudi Arabia, proposed a peace plan: Israel's full acceptance of the Arab world in exchange for full withdrawal from territories occupied in 1967. The plan was proposed in the Arab Summit Meeting in March 2002. 
Brutal Sharon and his right-wing followers flatly rejected the proposal. They do not give a damn about Arab recognition.<p> In January 2002 Sharon and his staff put a plan to reoccupy all of Palestinian towns. This invasion plan was put in effect a couple of days after Prince Abdalla's Peace Plan (Land for Peace), Marsh 2002. The aim is demolition of the Palestinian Authority and the infrastructure, arresting those involved in the Intifada (uprising) and if necessary assassinating them and preparing for a Palestinian Holocaust. Now the Palestinians are with:  No electricity. No water. No food. No medical
care. No press. No safety anywhere... innocents are being
slaughtered. Israel has barred press from "closed
military zones" , imprisoning the truth along with the
Palestinians as both are starved and tormented. The use of U.S. donated tanks and helicopter gunships against crowded Palestinian refugee camps, quite simply, is barbaric. Israel was trying to bury the evidence in Jenin refugee camp, but it cannot bury the terrible crime it has committed: a slaughter in which Palestinian civilians were cut down alongside the armed defenders of the camp. The Nazi's campaign was to destroy individuals
as swiftly as possible, the Israeli campaign is to destroy
the entire Palestinian population as slowly and as thoroughly as
possible. The bloody U.S.A. footprints are on the dead bodies of the
Palestinians and their children. 
<p> I quote Miss Janine Giovanni, The Times of London reporter: ". . . we had to run through olive groves,
dodging from tree to tree because of an Israeli sniper. I have seen
demolished houses before. I have seen wells stuffed with bodies. I have
seen civilians terrorized and living under siege. But what remains of
Jenin camp is a wasteland of death that once housed 13,000 people."

<p>"The closures on Gaza and the West Bank mean that today more than half the [Palestinian] population is living under the local poverty benchmark, which is $2 a day," said Mark Malloch Brown, the head of the United Nations Development Program. 
<p>Palestinians now know that it will result only in an Israeli version of apartheid. The blind devotion to Israel, even when Israel is wrong, is going to cost Americans - and no more than 17 young lives already lost in Yemen. The axiom "The friend of my enemy is my enemy" is very true.
<p>Avraham Burg was speaker of Israel's Knesset from 1999 to 2003 and is a former chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel. He is currently a Labor Party Knesset member. I quote from his article:
<p>   "It is very comfortable to be a Zionist in West Bank settlements such as Beit El and Ofra. The biblical landscape is charming. From the window you can gaze through the geraniums and bougainvilleas and not see the occupation. Traveling on the fast highway that takes you from Ramot on Jerusalem's northern edge to Gilo on the southern edge, a 12-minute trip that skirts barely a half-mile west of the Palestinian roadblocks, it's hard to comprehend the humiliating experience of the despised Arab who must creep for hours along the pocked, blockaded roads assigned to him. One road for the occupier, one road for the occupied.
<p>  This cannot work. Even if the Arabs lower their heads and swallow their shame and anger forever, it won't work. A structure built on human callousness will inevitably collapse in on itself. Note this moment well: Zionism's superstructure is already collapsing like a cheap Jerusalem wedding hall. Only madmen continue dancing on the top floor while the pillars below are collapsing."
<p>Construction of the so-called security fence, what Carter terms the
"imprisonment wall," accentuates the impact of new and expanded settlements
in the West Bank. The fence weaves in and out, sometimes following the
pre-1967 boundary, more often not. Largely built on Palestinian land, it
separates Palestinians from Palestinians, dividing and compartmentalizing
them. Javier Solana, the European Union foreign policy chief, said he was
"shocked" when he visited Israel in late January 2007 and saw the extent to
which the combination of Jewish settlement and security fence construction
was cutting into land Palestinians wanted - and needed - for a two-state
solution. He urged the Israelis to freeze West Bank settlements and stop
construction of the security fence.

<p><center>Failed Strategies, Continued Resistance May Force Bush and Sharon to Change Course
<p><center>By Rachelle Marshall
<p>"Reality may also be catching up with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. For three years he has used every violent means possible to crush Palestinian resistance. Palestinians have been jailed, beaten, bombed, and shot by Israeli forces. They have died when their ambulances were stopped at checkpoints. Their homes have been demolished and their fields and orchards destroyed. They have seen their children go hungry when Israeli soldiers prevented food trucks from getting through. The International Red Cross, which announced in November that it was giving up its emergency food program in the West Bank, warned that Israel's actions are leading to the worst humanitarian crisis. 
Some of Israel's most hard-headed officials have come to realize that brutal measures haven't worked, that despite the punishment Palestinians have endured they have survived with their aspirations and determination intact. As a result, there is mounting pressure on Sharon from inside Israel to change course. On Nov. 13 the prime minister was confronted with a front-page headline in the newspaper Yediot Ahronot reading: Four directors of GSS [Israel's General Security Services, or Shin Bet] warn: Israel in grave danger. The four security chiefs warned that Israel's economy, social fabric, and identity as a democracy were headed toward decline, and said only a political solution could end the conflict. They called on the government to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza, abandon most of the settlements, and end the immoral treatment of Palestinians."

The Neo-Colonialists are re-drawing the map of the whole region in the Middle East. New Sykes Picot. New Balfour. It is absolutely not The War Against Terror. The clear purpose of this war is not only to destroy Saddam Hussein's regime, it is to re-design the entire region and have full control over the oil. We are on the eve of a catastrophe. I can only hope that the world wakes up one day to say enough is enough. Wars are stupid.

<p> General and President Dwight Eisenhower
 said that, "Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket
fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are
not fed, those who are cold and not clothed."
<p>"Bush has destroyed the entire social, political, and economic fabric of Iraq. Saddam Hussein sat on the lid of Pandora's Box of sectarian antagonisms, but Bush has opened the lid. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians have been killed as 'collateral damage' in Bush's war to bring 'stable democracy' to Iraq. Tens of thousands of Iraqi children have been orphaned and maimed. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have fled their country. The Middle East is aflame with hatred of America, and the ground is shaking under the feet of American puppet governments in the Middle East.

will continue to be paid for many years unless the United States recovers

As one of the top Democratic recipients of <u>pro-Israel funds for the 2006 election cycle</u>, pocketing over $83,000, Hillary Clinton now has Iran in her cross hairs.
<p>During a Hanukkah dinner speech delivered in December 2005, hosted by Yeshiva University, Hillar Clinton prattled, "I held a series of meetings with Israeli officials [last summer], including the prime minister and the foreign minister and the head of the [Israel Defense Forces], to discuss such challenges we confront. In each of these meetings, we talked at length about the dire threat posed by the potential of a nuclear-armed Iran, not only to Israel, but also to Europe and Russia. Just this week, the new president of Iran made further outrageous comments that attacked Israel's right to exist that are simply beyond the pale of international discourse and acceptability. During my meeting with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, I was reminded vividly of the threats that Israel faces every hour of every day. It became even more clear how important it is for the United States to stand with Israel."
<p>As Hillary Clinton embraces Israel's violence, as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090831164224/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLDgw5hFnR4&amp;mode=related&amp;search="><font color="#FF0000">AIPAC's </a></font> fraudulent posture on Iran, she simultaneously ignores the hostilities inflicted upon Palestine, as numerous Palestinians have been killed during the continued shelling of the Gaza Strip over the past year.
<p>Hillary Clinton's silence toward Israel's brutality implies the senator will continue to support AIPAC's mission to occupy the whole of the occupied territories, as well as a war on Iran. AIPAC is correct even President Bush appears to be a little sheepish when up against the warmongering of Hillary Clinton.
<p>The U.S. supplies Israel with its latest, most advanced and secret weapons (often before they are available to its own armed forces), thus making Israel The Super Power in the area. Israel is militarily the most powerful state in the Middle East. It is loaded to the gills with advanced weaponry.  It has everything from missiles, atomic bombs and advanced fighters to helicopters, gun ships, tanks and armored personnel carriers.

<p> Israel not only already has developed a very
dangerous arsenal of weapons of mass destruction but also is a psychotic
nest of murderous thugs posing a danger to the whole world. More than
that, Israel has repeatedly shown itself willing to use terrorist
tactics against anyone, including America, anytime it thinks it can get
away with it. When armaments are in the hands of immoral people, the danger is high that a nuclear war could be launched. Indeed, people in power who have no morality and no judgment can be expected to do anything, including killing millions of people.
<p><font color="FF0000">A memorable example of that is Israel's murderous attack on the U.S.S.

United States) and torpedo boats.</font>

Phil's story was familiar to me and is true.  He is a wounded U.S. Navy survivor of Israel's 1967 vicious attack on the USS Liberty, which became a deliberate cover-up by military top brass under directives from President Johnson.  In case you didn't know, Israel attacked and wounded half the crew and killed over 30 of Tourney's crewmates.  
Tourney rose with a question, and with pain in his voice he told the entire audience about his own story of two adult daughters from whom he has been essentially estranged because he tried to tell them about his life-changing experience of four decades ago.  They refuse to listen because Israel is involved.
<p><font color="FF0000">Tourney's story detailed how every one of the crew survivors was threatened by a general officer of the Navy with 'prison or worse' if he ever told anyone what really happened on the USS Liberty.</font>  For two decades, Tourney did not even tell his wife.  And when he finally broke silence, as a number of his crewmembers had, his own daughters rejected him.  Both, he said, had become Judeo-Christian church members and believed that Israel was ordained by God to occupy Palestine, and can do no wrong.  Most Judeo-Christians are taught anyone who speaks against Israel may be damned by God... including their own father.  Imagine the pain."</font>

Although dwarfed by the nuclear arsenals of the U.S. and Russia, each possessing over 10,000 nuclear weapons, Israel nonetheless is a major nuclear power, and should be publicly recognized as such. Since the Gulf War in 1991, while much attention has been lavished on the threat posed by Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, the major culprit in the region, Israel, has been largely ignored. Possessing chemical and biological weapons, an extremely sophisticated nuclear arsenal, and an aggressive strategy for their actual use, Israel provides the major regional impetus for the development of weapons of mass destruction and represents an acute threat to peace and stability in the Middle East. The Israeli nuclear program represents a serious impediment to nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation and, with India and Pakistan, is a potential nuclear flashpoint (prospects of meaningful non-proliferation are a delusion so long as the nuclear weapons states insist on maintaining their arsenals). Citizens concerned about sanctions against Iraq, peace with justice in the Middle East, and nuclear disarmament have an obligation to speak out forcefully against the Israeli nuclear program."<p><center><font size="6">....John Steinbach<br><font size="5">March 2002</font></u>

<p>George Bush proposes another large tax cut for the 1% of the population that is comparatively rich. The public education system is in crisis and health insurance for 50 million Americans simply does not exist. Israel asks for $15bn in additional loan guarantees and military aid. And the unemployment rates in the US mount inexorably, as more jobs are lost every day.

<p><font color="#009900" size="5">A quote from an article by John Pilger on Jan. 29, 2003:
<p>"Unelected in 2000, the Washington regime of George W Bush is now totalitarian, captured by a clique whose fanaticism and ambitions of "endless war" and "full spectrum dominance" are a matter of record.
<p>All the world knows their names: Bush, Rumsfeld, Rice, Wolfowitz, Cheney and Perle, and Powell, the false liberal. Bush's State of the Union speech was reminiscent of that other great moment in 1938 when Hitler called his generals together and told them: "I must have war." He then had it.
<p>The current American elite is the Third Reich of our times, although this distinction ought not to let us forget that they have merely accelerated more than half a century of unrelenting American state terrorism: from the atomic bombs dropped cynically on Japan as a signal of their new power to the dozens of countries invaded, directly or by proxy, to destroy democracy wherever it collided with American "interests", such as a voracious appetite for the world's resources, like oil."
<p> I quote Jack M. Balkin, Knight Professor of Constitutional Law and the First Amendment at Yale Law School. September 22, 2002:
<p> 
"Today the world faces a single man armed with weapons of mass destruction, manifesting an aggressive, bullying attitude, who may well plunge the world into chaos and bloodshed if he miscalculates. This person, belligerent, arrogant and sure of himself, truly is the most dangerous person on Earth. The problem is that his name is George W. Bush, and he is our president." 
<p>  I quote Edward Said, April 2003:
 <p>"Bush's team had given Ariel Sharon's government a free hand to colonize the West Bank and Gaza, to kill, detain and expel people at will, to demolish their homes, expropriate their land, imprison them by curfew and hundreds of military blockades, make life for them generally speaking impossible; after 9/11, Sharon simply hitched his wagon to "the war on terrorism" and intensified his unilateral depredations against a defenseless civilian population, now under occupation for 39 years, despite literally tens of UN Security Council resolutions enjoining Israel to withdraw and otherwise desist from its war crimes and human rights abuses. Bush called Sharon a man of peace last June, and kept the five billion dollar subsidy coming without even the vaguest hint that it was at risk because of Israel's lawless brutality." 
<p>The U.S. is indeed the strongest nation in the world, the only one powerful enough to unite the planet  against itself
<p> "Despite being the single largest polluter of the world's atmosphere, and on a per capita basis the most profligate of the major nations, the US (along with Australia) has refused to join the 178 states that have accepted the Kyoto Protocol."

"If there�s a starting point for George W. Bush�s attachment to Israel, it�s the day in late 1998, when he stood on a hilltop where Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount, and, with eyes brimming with tears, read aloud from his favorite hymn, �Amazing Grace.� He was very emotional. It was a tear-filled experience. He brought Israel back home with him in his heart. I think he came away profoundly moved."</font>

<p> "I had set out to explain how exactly our government came to be so hated
around the world. As a CIA term of tradecraft, "blowback" does not just mean
retaliation for things our government has done to, and in, foreign
countries. It refers specifically to retaliation for illegal operations
carried out abroad that were kept totally secret from the American public.
These operations have included the clandestine overthrow of governments
various administrations did not like, the training of foreign militaries in
the techniques of state terrorism, the rigging of elections in foreign
countries, interference with the economic viability of countries that seemed
to threaten the interests of influential American corporations, as well as
the torture or assassination of selected foreigners. The fact that these
actions were, at least originally, secret meant that when retaliation does
come -- as it did so spectacularly on September 11, 2001 -- the American
public is incapable of putting the events in context. Not surprisingly,
then, Americans tend to support speedy acts of revenge intended to punish
the actual, or alleged, perpetrators. These moments of lashing out, of
course, only prepare the ground for yet another cycle of blowback."

In addition, while we're chronicling the carnage, let us not forget that we're the only nation to ever use nuclear weapons as an act of war (the most massive terrorist attack of all time) wherein we killed hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians for no other reason than to put Stalin on notice that we were to be the lone colossus bestriding the war decimated post-war world."

<p>Rabbi Lerner of Tikkun explained: "Jewish voters are only 2% of the U.S. population, but they are mostly concentrated in the states with the highest number of delegate and electoral votes (New York, California, Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois), they contribute financially to politicians disproportionately to their percentage of the voters, and they are often in key roles as opinion shapers in the communities in which they work or live." 
<p>Both Democrats and Republicans assume that a successful candidate must be traditionally �pro-Israel� � promoting unconditional American backing for Israel, its current government and policies � in order to gain the support of the American Jewish constituency. Periodically a candidate will get attacked for not being supportive enough of Israel, but unlike other foreign policy issues, regarding Israel it�s generally felt that no more discussion is needed, and general silence is encouraged.
<p> Every
member of Congress and every would-be candidate for Congress comes to
quickly understand a basic lesson. Money needed to run for office can come
with great ease from supporters of Israel, provided that the candidate makes
certain promises, in writing, to vote favorably on issues considered
important to Israel. What drives much of congressional support for Israel is
fear - fear that the pro-Israel lobby will either withhold campaign
contributions or give money to one's opponent.
<p>  
"A friend of mine used about the US election campaigns a phrase that I took to heart: Voting for either of the candidates is like choosing between the plague and cholera. In Denmark we enjoy relatively great health care, a good social security system, high unemployment subsidies; these things make our country safe - We have low crime rates (Virtually the only people committing crimes are troubled youth...) and we do not have to worry as much about money and health care as the Americans do. And that, my American friends, is freedom for you. Freedom to go to school, and freedom to walk the streets. The problem with America, in my opinion, and in most Danes' opinion, is that America does not have a strong party of the Socialist ideology, like we Danes do - I do not know why a country with as many poor people and crime issues as America do not have a strong Socialistic party to solve some of the poverty issues or at least help balance them out. It makes no sense that the country has only Liberal and Conservative candidates when a that huge part of the populace ought to be Socialists, historically speaking. Maybe the 'commoners' in the States just have very low political consciousness...but I want everyone to see that America has to decrease crime rates and poverty before they should even have a foreign policy."<br>

<p> "It is no mere coincidence that Democratic Party Republicrat, Barack Obama, had the unheard of amount of approximately 600 million dollars in his political campaign coffer compared with fellow Republican Party Republicrat, John McCain�s, approximately 100 million campaign coffer dollars. This fact alone should give some crucial insight into the despicable financial role played by corporations, and their outrageous, unacceptable, and massively inordinate amount of influence and control over the electoral system in this so-called democracy. Most of this money is blood money, based upon exploitation from the corporate Wall Street and military corporate elite. This fact alone gives yet another good indication as to what to expect under an Obama presidency. It is totally reprehensible and unacceptable and an utter mockery of democracy."

The leaders of the establishment Jewish community put Kerry on notice that the number-one Jewish issue was not erosion of the church-state divide, civil rights or a just peace in the Middle East, but rather support of Israel right or wrong. Almost immediately, Kerry endorsed Bush and Sharon's agreement to accept permanent Jewish settlements on Palestinian land, thus reversing almost 40 years of US policy.

Democracy means that the Palestinian public, like all others, could freely elect its representatives and leaders, says Gush Shalom, the Israeli Peace Bloc. For better or worse, Hamas is one of the two main political parties on the Palestinian scene. Palestinian elections without the Hamas would be a meaningless farce, like US elections from which the Republican or the Democratic Party was excluded. The State of Israel should be willing to negotiate with whoever wins the elections and becomes the elected representative of the Palestinian people. If the government of Israel wants to influence the outcome of the elections, the only legitimate way to do it is to take concrete and visible steps showing its intention to put an end to the occupation."

Blair, a man who, according to the Geneva Conventions, is to be held personally responsible for more than 700,000 dead in Iraq for failing to 'protect civilian populations against certain consequences of war'. A man who is supposed to be charged for genocide at The Hague. That's right, a man who should end his life behind bars is now becoming a peace envoy."

By<br>John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt</a></font> 
<p><left> Iquote Uri Avnery (a conscientious Israeli):
<p>"I COULD tell some more stories like these, but the point is made. I recount them only in connection with the scandal recently caused by two American professors, Stephen Walt of Harvard and John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago. They published a research paper on the influence of the Israel lobby in the United States.
<p> 
In 80 pages, 40 of them footnotes and sources, the two show how the pro-Israel lobby exercises unbridled power in the US capital, how it terrorizes the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, how the White House dances to its tune (if indeed a house can dance), how the important media obey its orders and how the universities, too, live in fear of it.
<p> 
The paper caused a storm. And I don't mean the predictable wild attacks by the "friends of Israel" - which means almost all politicians, journalists and professors. These pelted the authors with all the usual accusations: that they were anti-Semites, that they were resurrecting the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and so forth.  There was something paradoxical in these attacks, since they only illustrated the authors' case.
<p> 
But the debate that fascinates me is of a different nature. It broke out between senior intellectuals, from the legendary Noam Chomsky, the guru of the Left throughout the world (including Israel), to progressive websites everywhere. The bone of contention: the conclusion of the paper that the Jewish-Israeli lobby dominates US foreign policy and subjugates it to Israeli interests - in glaring contradiction to the national interest of the US itself. A case in point: the American assault on Iraq."

<p> There's more evidence than ever piling up that the Jewish (Zionist)
stringpullers who control Bush are desperate to destabilize and
engage in violent "regime change" in any state that threatens
Israel's hegemony and power to conquer or destroy anyone they
choose in the Middle East. Examples are Syria, Lebanon and Iran.
<p>"Israel is a scofflaw nation and should be treated as such. Instead of helping Sharon intensify Palestinian misery, our president should suspend all aid until Israel ends its occupation of Arab land Israel seized in 1967. The suspension would force Sharon's compliance or lead to his removal from office, as the Israeli electorate will not tolerate a prime minister who is at odds with the White House. 
<p>If Bush needs an additional reason for doing the right thing, he can justify the suspension as a matter of military necessity, an essential step in winning international support for his war on terrorism. He can cite a worthy precedent. When President Abraham Lincoln issued the proclamation that freed only the slaves in states that were then in rebellion, he made the restriction because of "military necessity". 
<p>If Bush suspends US aid, he will liberate all Americans from long years of bondage to Israel's misdeeds."

in the U.S. is very powerful. In fact, its influence over the US Congress and Senate calls into question the degree to which the American legislature has been corrupted by lobby groups. Uri Avnery, the leader of Gush Shalom, the most courageous Israeli peace group, pointed out in his essay: that Americans have to turn to hear just how mighty the lobby has become. "Its electoral and financial power casts a long shadow over both houses of the Congress. Hundreds of Senators and Congressmen were elected with the help of Jewish contributions.

<p>"Impeaching Bush and Co. ultimately won�t change anything unless we deal with the corrupt powers which control and direct them. George Bush is just a finger-puppet of the hidden hand which animates him. Bush only has apparent power, as he himself is a minion of far more powerful predator-like forces whose nefarious interests he serves. Whether we call it the illuminati, the global elite, a shadow government, or a secret cabal, there is no doubt that there are darker, self-serving forces that have insinuated themselves into and taken over our government. The terrorists that we should be worried about are domestic terrorists who are actually implementing their agendas from deep within our very system of government itself.
<p>The corporate war machine, which is co-dependently entangled with our government, profits wildly from our invading other sovereign countries. The government-military-industrial complex�s solution to the very problem that they created by instigating wars � more war! It�s completely sick and totally insane.

<p><font color="#FFCC00">"The atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a criminal act on an epic scale. It was premeditated mass murder that unleashed a weapon of intrinsic criminality. For this reason its apologists have sought refuge in the mythology of the ultimate "good war", whose "ethical bath", as Richard Drayton called it, has allowed the west not only to expiate its bloody imperial past but to promote 60 years of rapacious war, always beneath the shadow of The Bomb."</font>
<p><font color="#FF00FF"> ""Brzezinski, Holbrooke and Albright form the "Imperialist A-Team"; these are not the bungling "Keystone Cops" neocons like Feith and Rumsfeld who trip over themselves getting out of bed in the morning. These are cold-blooded Machiavellian imperialists who know how to work the media and the diplomatic channels to conceal their genocidal operations behind a smokescreen of humanitarian mumbo-jumbo. They know what they are doing and they are good at it. They're not fools. They have aligned themselves with the Obama camp and are preparing for the next big outbreak of global trouble-making. This should serve as a sobering wake-up call for voters who still think Obama represents "Change We Can Believe In"".</font>

<p>Too many American politicians have treasonously betrayed the American people by blindly supporting the leading terrorist nation on earth: Israel.
<p> 
Jewish power is the centerpiece of the American politicians'
whole life. The Jewish media determine how the ignorant will view
the politician, therefore he can never afford to cross the Jews,
or they'll rip him to shreds on the air and in print.
The Jewish media determine the range of acceptable debate on all
issues important to Jews. They determine how far a politician can
go in expressing concern for
the Palestinians' plight.
<p><font color="#FFCC00">The former head of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee, William Fulbright:"Senator William Fulbright, then chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, conducted hearings on foreign influence-buying in Congress in the 1960s.</font> He later said:<font color="#FF0000"> "I hadn't realized before the hearings that the Jewish lobby was so powerful. � I didn't know they were subverting the Congress." He also said: "The lobby can just about tell the President what to do when it comes to Israel. Its influence in Congress is pervasive and, I think, profoundly harmful...to us and ultimately to Israel itself." These comments came from one of the most influential U.S. senators of the twentieth century. Senator Fulbright was known for his courage � for example, in 1954 he challenged Senator Joseph McCarthy, then at the height of his powers. Senator Fulbright also raised strong objections to President Kennedy about the impending Bay of Pigs Cuban invasion. In 1966, Fulbright published The Arrogance of Power in which he attacked the justification for the Vietnam War and Congress' failure to set limits on it."</font>
<p>  <font color="#FFCC00" size="6">George Ball<font color="#FFCC00" size="4">, Undersecretary of State 1961 to 1966 and U.S. Permanent Represetative to the U.N. in 1968, on 15 July opened a statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with these words: <font color="#FF0000">"The burden of my comments this morning is that our country urgently needs to recast its relations with Israel."</font> He also said after the Israeli invasions of 1956 and 1967, the bombing raid on an Iraqi nuclear reactor, the savage bombing of residential areas of Beirut a month later and the invasion of Lebanon:<font color="#FF0000"> "Such a protracted sequence of events has established a pattern so routine as to be taken for granted."</font> Ball concluded:<font color="#FF0000"> "It is a habit we should break. United States policy has marched to an Israeli drum far too long".</font>

<p> He  asserted on CBS's Face the Nation that "Israel and its uncritical friends in America controls the United States Senate and consequently control U.S. policy for the middle East. Subsequently he said he saw little hope that Capitol Hill would effectively challenge the Israeli lobby. It was, he said, "suicide for politicians to oppose them." <p>Senator Fulbright was no dummy; it is in his name that the brightest students scramble after the so-named "Fulbright" scholarships.
<p><center><font color="#FFCC00" size="6">Paul Findley</font>
<p>"In my 1985 book, "They Dare to Speak Out," I detailed the tactics used to silence criticism of Israeli policies. One of the groups employing these tactics is the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. On its Web site, AIPAC calls itself "America's pro-Israel lobby" and boasts a New York Times description of it as "the most important organization affecting America's relationship with Israel." All citizens have the right to band together and push for policies they believe are right. But AIPAC and other pro-Israel lobby groups do not plead the case for Israel on the stage of public opinion. Instead, they often resort to smear campaigns and intimidation to clear the floor so that only their side is heard."
<p><center><font color="#FFCC00"> (Paul Findley 'Carter enters lions' den' .story  February 7, 2007).</font> 
<p>Several Democrat past leaders, including the famous Senator William Fulbright, have proclaimed for the last 58 years that U.S. foreign policy has been made in Tel Aviv.
<p>The extent of Jewish power was demonstrated recently when Senator
J. William Fulbright addressed an audience of 18 million
listeners on Meet the Press and replied to a question referring
to Israel that there is nothing you can do about it because more
than 80% of the Senate are controlled by Jews, practically in
those very words. After 32 years in Congress, most of that time
as the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
Senator Fulbright was defeated by a newcomer in the primary which
took place a few months later, and was not reelected to Congress. 
<p><font color="#FF0000" size="5">"The U.S. should retreat back to its more Jeffersonian roots, that it should stop meddling in the affairs of other nations and the private affairs of its own citizens."</font>
<p><center><img src="/web/20090831164224im_/http://geocities.com/zuhairhm/Zuhair/flowerline.gif">
<p>"The reader might wish to have a look at Kevin MacDonald's The Culture of Critique: An Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements where they will learn that "ethnic Jews have a powerful influence in the American media far larger than any other identifiable group. The extent of Jewish ownership and influence on the popular media in the United States is remarkable given the relatively small proportion of the population that is Jewish."
<p>In other words, Israel is in control of the means of creating the "official culture" of America to suit its own agenda, including making the terms "conspiracy theory" and "anti-Semitic" such horrible epithets that no one would dare to speak anything that might put them at risk of be so branded!"
<p><font color="#FFCC00">It is useful to keep George Washington's warning constantly in mind: "Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake; since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government."
<p>Zionism and AIPAC are foreign influence in USA.</font>
<p>Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft, Rumsfeld, and the others got into politics
knowing ahead of time that if elected they would have to play by Jewish
rules. <p>  All the world is at risk when the world's greatest nuclear
superpower is having its strings pulled by a bunch of arrogant
megalomaniacs who believe that they are <a href="THEOLDESTLIE.htm"><font color="FF0000">God's chosen people</a></font> and can do
whatever they want.
<p> The U.S. is so willing  to let Israel lead America into finishing up what Hitler started.  The players change but the game is still the same: state sponsored racism.

What the U.S. can and cannot do in the Middle East is determined by the Israeli government through the power and influence of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090831164224/http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article15494.htm" <p><font color="#FF0000">Israeli Lobby </a></font>in the U.S., which has penetrated all the U.S. government Departments, including the Defence. For Israel the Pentagon is <u><font color="#FF0000">'stop and shop'</u></font>. George Ball, a former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said on the "60 Minutes" interview that the Israeli Lobby "has done an enormous job of corrupting the American democratic process."

<p>The administration's announcement last week, (April 2005), that it was supplying 100 "bunker-buster" bombs to the Israel Air Force was the most blatant sign that America is likely to sanction an Israeli attack on the underground uranium-enrichment facilities in Iran. For now, it's only a deterrent: It will be months before the bombs arrive in Israel and the pilots are trained to drop them.<font color="#FF0000"> But everyone is fully aware of the intended use of such armaments, which until today have not been supplied to any country outside the the United States.</font>
<p> I quote a conscientious American, Henry H. Lindner, MD:
<p>"We Americans must begin to ask ourselves, why did we support the violent creation of the state of Israel, by Jews and for Jews, with no regard for the rights of the inhabitants of Palestine?  Why did we support the Zionists as they killed, terrorized and expelled 750,000 non-Jewish civilians from their homes in 1947 to 1949?  Why did we support the Israeli invasion of Syria, Egypt, and the West Bank in 1967, the expulsion of another 500,000 non-Jews from these territories, and the 35-year military occupation?  Why have we supported this Zionist/Israeli war against the people of Palestine and the surrounding countries for 55 years?  We Americans, blinded by false information and religious/racial prejudice, have granted this Jewish racial state a moral carte blanche to discriminate against non-Jews and commit any atrocity."  
<p>  "When it comes to terror and the Arabs, writes Gideon Samet, editorial board member at Israel's leading liberal newspaper, Haaretz, the United States has become "more Israeli than the Israelis...."

<p><center>A quote from "Mid East Peace An Illusion? - By Pat Buchanan":
<p>  "When Israeli and U.S. policies clash, it is U.S. presidents 
who back down. For 30 years, the United States has held that 
settlements in the territories occupied in the 1967 war were 
"illegal" and impediments to peace. Yet, despite $100 billion 
in U.S. aid to Israel since 1972 ? $20,000 for every Israeli ? 
the number of settlers has risen from 8,400 to 357,000. Israel 
ignores U.S. pleas and demands, for it knows they are bluster 
and bluff, designed for Arab consumption". <p> Israel is the U.S.'s spoiled child.</i></b></font></p>

<p>Americans dying for the Jews.
<p>"But let's lay out the undeniable facts. Israel considers Iran its main threat. Israel wants a U.S. attack against Iran. The Israeli lobby does what the Israeli government tells it to do. Anybody who claims the Israeli lobby is just another lobby is either ignorant or lying. The Israeli lobby is the second most, if not the most, powerful lobby in America. So, sit back and watch the Israeli amen corner start the propaganda to push America to war with Iran just as it did in the case of Iraq. In my opinion, Americans who want American youth to die and bleed for the benefit of a foreign country are guilty of more than dual loyalty."
