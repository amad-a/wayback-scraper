When I travel, I laugh a lot and I don't usually cry.&nbsp; But all that changed 
the day Israeli archeologist Ronen Bitan drove me about an hour north of 
Jerusalem to Mount Gerizim, in the Palestinian Authority, on the West 
Bank.&nbsp; He led me into the small Samaritan museum, and as I walked around, 
looking at the exotic clothes, texts and artifacts of a culture I know nothing 
about, Yefet Kohen, the director of the museum, came up to me. We Samaritans are 
very ancient people who belong to the house of Israel. There are only 300 
Samaritans who live here on Mount Gerizim.&nbsp; Our Bible is the oldest Bible 
that exists.&nbsp; It is written in the Samaritan language, which is the oldest 
form of Hebrew, almost like Aramaic. Look, look at the letters.&nbsp; Each one 
of them corresponds to a body part.&nbsp; The ‘ayen’ is really an eye, the ‘peh’ 
is a mouth. And look over here--this is our genealogy, every generation, every 
name, going all the way back to Moses.&nbsp; Then he pointed to a small photo 
gallery on the wall and lovingly indicated the picture of his venerable father. 
I started to sob.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am only now beginning to understand what moved 
me to tears.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Most people know nothing about the Samaritans except that in the New Testament, 
there was a good Samaritan who showed kindness and generosity to the victim of a 
roadside robbery. The general interpretation is that even though the Samaritans 
were despised, there was a still a good one among them.&nbsp; So who were these 
people, and why were they so vilified?</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The answer to this question is intertwined with the fact that the Jewish view of 
the Samaritans and the Samaritan view of the Samaritans is radically 
different.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the Jews I spoke with, including Rabbis and 
scholars, describe the Samaritans as non-Jews who claim they are Jews, or as 
people who were once Jews, in the very distant past.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
722 B.C.E., when the northern part of Israel was conquered by the Assyrians, the 
military strategy of the victors was to exchange populations.&nbsp; They exiled 
the northern tribes to diverse regions of the Assyrian Empire, and peopled the 
north of Israel with others they had conquered from Babylonia, Hamath, Cutha and 
among the nomadic Arabs. These pagan newcomers merged with those who had 
remained in Israel, and they became the Samaritans.&nbsp; They adopted Jewish 
ways, but they are not Jews.&nbsp; They practice loathsome customs like dove 
worship and ritual sacrifice. They bow down to other gods, they were the enemies 
of king David, and they are anathema to the Jews.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Samaritan side of the story is that there was a gradual separation of the 
northern tribes of Israel from the tribes in the south.&nbsp; After the 
division, the people from the north were called Samaritans because the name of 
their region was Samaria.&nbsp;&nbsp; The people from the south were called Jews 
because their origin was from Judah.&nbsp; After the split, a rivalry ensued 
between the north and the south.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The main bone of contention seems to be that King David established the Davidic 
monarchy in the south, in Jerusalem, but to the Samaritans, the holy site is, 
and always has been, Mount Gerizim in the north.&nbsp; They do not recognize 
Jerusalem and consider it more of a political entity and a fictional creation 
than a holy place.&nbsp; They scorn King David because he lusted after Bat 
Sheva, a married woman. He got her pregnant and tried to deceive her innocent 
husband into thinking the baby in the womb of Bat Sheva was his. And then, in an 
act of unparalleled immorality, he had the husband, who was a loyal soldier, 
killed at war. The holy tabernacle of the Israelites wasn’t at Shiloh, as the 
Jews tell it, but was at Mount Gerizim. The Jews claim that Abraham took Isaac 
to be sacrificed on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem.&nbsp; The Samaritans say that it 
wasn¹t Mount Moriah at all-but was Mount Gerizim.&nbsp; They also claim that 
they have the oldest version of the Torah in their ancient language and it comes 
directly from Aaron, the brother of Moses.&nbsp; The Jewish version of the 
Torah, which was altered by Ezra, is less authentic and has over 6,000 
discrepancies from the original text; most of them are deleted references to the 
holy Har Gerizim.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Samaritans do not recognize those who called 
themselves prophets: to them, Moses is the only true prophet.&nbsp; They had a 
strong and powerful kingdom in the north that was conquered by the Assyrians. 
Some of them were exiled, but the numbers were greatly exaggerated; a good 
number of them remained in Israel. Those people have kept up their ancient 
tribal customs until today. They are not Jews, descended from the tribe of 
Judah, but their lineage goes back to Joseph¹s sons-Menasseh and Ephraim, who 
settled in the north of Israel.&nbsp; They consider themselves 
Samaritan-Israelites. They have suffered horrific persecutions, mass murders, 
forced conversions, forced idol worship, humiliations and every assault on their 
faith at the hands of Christians, Muslims and Assyrians.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 4th 
and 5th centuries C.E., there were more than a million Samaritans. By the 
beginning of the 20th century, there were only l46 souls left.&nbsp; Today they 
cling to their culture and there are about 300 who live on Mt. Gerizim and 
another 325 in the town of Holon, south of Tel-Aviv.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
So who is right?&nbsp; The Samaritans are so small and so unheard that they have 
little credibility, and yet, that day in the Samaritan museum, something told me 
that there was truth in their side of the story.&nbsp; I couldn¹t put my finger 
on it, but it had to do with piety and persistence and all the proofs they kept 
proffering.&nbsp; When they allowed me into their synagogue and I saw their 
Torah and heard their devotion to the Torah and the laws of Moses, I had this 
feeling that I was encountering the real thing-that despite some modern 
trappings, these people were maintaining the same traditions today that the 
tribes of Israel practiced three thousand years ago.&nbsp; I felt in my bones 
that the Samaritans provided us with an opportunity to experience living 
history, and that we needed to hear what they were saying.&nbsp; No one I spoke 
to agreed with me.&nbsp; They adhered to the ³official² version of who the 
Samaritans are.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I interviewed a few of the Samaritans at length.&nbsp; Yefet Kohen, in his 
museum, showed me a map that he had worked on for twenty years.&nbsp; It 
indicated where the Israelites had stopped and lived in the desert during their 
forty years of exile after the exodus from Egypt.&nbsp; He said that for years 
he had also been trying to figure out how the urim v’tummim worked.&nbsp; How 
could he know that I was obsessed with the same question? The urim v’tummim were 
precious stones on an ephod, or apron.&nbsp; They were worn by the high priest 
and were used for divination by the leaders of the Israelites.&nbsp; It was said 
that each of the stones had the name of one of the twelve tribes inscribed, and 
when there was a problem with one of the tribes, the corresponding stone would 
light up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yefet Kohen said he thought he knew how this worked. There 
was a thin gold wire around the stones, and when the priest wore the ephod and 
consulted the urim v’tummim, the beating of his heart sent out an electrical 
current along the golden wire.&nbsp; If there was a problem, the priest was so 
tuned in that the energy would be blocked at one of the stones and by 
identifying the stone, he would know in which tribe the problem was.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Whew, I thought that was pretty brilliant.&nbsp; But even more: if this man were 
a fake Israelite, if he were someone masquerading as a Hebrew, why in the world 
would he care?</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Samaritans do not have rabbis, and their religion is pre-rabbinic in 
origin.&nbsp; They are presided over by a cohen gadol, or High Priest, in the 
tradition handed down by Aaron, the brother of Moses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their 
religious and political leaders are all Levite priests.&nbsp; I spoke at length 
with one of the priests, in the synagogue. His name was Itamar Abraham 
Cohen.&nbsp;&nbsp; He took out the Torah scroll, adorned in gorgeous, 
shimmering, bright green material, and pointed to the three crowns on top.&nbsp; 
He explained that these crowns represented the origins of the Samaritans-the 
tribes of Ephraim, Menasseh and Levi (from Aaron).&nbsp; He showed me the 
beautiful ancient letters of the Samaritan script, which looked almost like 
Aramaic to my untrained eye.&nbsp; And then he showed me how the Samaritans 
pray: down on their knees, heads to the ground, facing the holy ark and Mount 
Gerizim. Their synagogue has no adornment and no chairs. There are rugs on the 
floor.&nbsp; Their hours of prayer are very long, very intense.&nbsp; On 
Sabbath, the men come to the synagogue and start praying at 3 a.m.&nbsp; During 
the course of the Sabbath day, they come to the synagogue three times to 
pray.&nbsp; The Torah is held up during the services, but the study of the 
weekly Torah portions happens at home, with the family, when the men return from 
their 3 a.m. prayers, before eating breakfast. </p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Wow, I thought. That’s really amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp; If this man were a fake 
Hebrew, why was he telling me, in great detail, about the origins of his people 
from the tribes of Israel? Why was there such devotion and prayer? What did they 
have to gain from it?</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I met Yefet Tsedaka, who lives in Holon and publishes A.B., the bi-weekly 
Samaritan newspaper, with his brother Benyamim.&nbsp; He told me that the 
Samaritans only believe in the Pentateuch, the five books of Moses, and not the 
other sections of the Bible that came later. </p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">They 
do not celebrate the ‘newer’ holidays--Hanukah and Purim.&nbsp; On Passover, 
they celebrate the way the Torah commands them to, re-enacting the Exodus from 
Egypt.&nbsp; Every Samaritan, no matter where he lives, makes a pilgrimage to 
the holy Mount Gerizim.&nbsp; There, at night, on the sacrificial spot and under 
the watchful eye of the High Priest, they ritually slaughter unblemished male 
sheep in their first year.&nbsp; They roast them in ovens and eat them 
hurriedly, and everything must be eaten by the end of the night. If anything is 
left, it must be thrown into the fire.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the Samaritans, 
especially the young men, adorn themselves in the white clothes the Israelites 
wore when they fled from Egypt.&nbsp; They eat matza--or unleavened bread--that 
is very large, soft, flat and round. They eat the matza and bitter herbs as they 
consume the lamb.&nbsp; (An Israeli specialist in ‘second Temple’ Judaism 
confirmed to me that this is how the Jews conducted sacrifices and ate matza 
during the period.)</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Yefet talked about the harvest festival of the Samaritans. He explained that 
they were persecuted and attacked by Byzantines when the holiday of Succoth came 
and they constructed and lived in their tabernacles outside, the way Jews 
do.&nbsp; So they took them indoors for protection.&nbsp; Now they continue to 
construct the Succoth or tabernacles indoors, and they celebrate in a very 
unique fashion.&nbsp; They go into the orchards and spend a fortune on fruits 
which they hang from the ceiling.&nbsp; Last year, Yefet hung more than half a 
ton of fruit.&nbsp; Yefet waxed eloquent about the Samaritan marriage ceremony, 
which lasts for a week.&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘And do you know what we are re-enacting 
during the wedding process?&nbsp; The first marriage in Israelite history.&nbsp; 
The marriage of Rebekah and Isaac, from the Bible.’</p>

Why was I crying again?&nbsp; In Yefet¹s words, there was deep truth. And yet, 
few of the people I spoke to give the Samaritan¹s words much credence.</p>

I returned to America, and I read everything I could about the Samaritans.&nbsp; 
I consulted their own newspaper--called A.B.-and the CD-rom I bought at the 
museum.&nbsp; I read Chaim Potok¹s History of the Jews again and wrote to 
Rabbis.&nbsp; I went to Border¹s bookstore and thumbed through every book I 
could find on Jewish history.&nbsp; I corresponded with Benyamim Tsedaka by 
email and read his entry and other entries in the Encyclopedia Judaica.&nbsp; 
There was so much conflicting evidence.&nbsp; It was clear that Biblical history 
was written by a Judean writer, from the south.&nbsp; He wrote about Jerusalem 
and the Davidic line and largely ignored or discounted the northern kingdom and 
Mount Gerizim. It was also apparent that there was competition and enmity 
between Jerusalem and Mount Gerizim, and it seems to be both religious and 
political in nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; But how could I ever get to the truth?</p>

And then, one night, a fellow writer forwarded to me an article from the 
Jerusalem Post that caused quite a stir in Israel. Briefly, the article (by 
Abraham Rabinovich) explains that some scholars are challenging the historical 
truth of key elements of the Bible.....and their proof is in archeological 
finds.&nbsp; I read the article in a breathless state.&nbsp; The conventional 
view of the formation of Israel is centered around King David, ascending to the 
throne of Judah about 3,000 years ago, and uniting the northern tribes into the 
Judean monarchy.&nbsp; He and his son Solomon ruled for 70 years over a vast 
empire, and then the kingdom split apart after Solomon’s death. </p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
But the potsherds tell a different tale.&nbsp; Israel, in the north, was 
well-developed, had a palatial government center in Samaria, fortified sites, 
and large settlements that were signs of a strong and mature economic and 
political center.&nbsp; If Jerusalem were the seat of such a powerful monarchy, 
if it were the center of the vast empire that the Bible describes, why did the 
archeological finds suggest tiny settlements, and a very unimpressive 
Jerusalem?&nbsp; The potsherds indicate that Judah only emerged as a powerful 
entity after the fall of the north to the Assyrians.&nbsp; And it seems as 
though many of the people of the north fled to the south, greatly increasing 
Jerusalem¹s population, but many of the northerners also stayed where they 
were.&nbsp;&nbsp; An Assyrian account of the conquest confirms a population 
transfer, but the numbers are much less than those stated in the Biblical 
version.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This coincides remarkably with what the Samaritans are saying.&nbsp; They did 
not recognize the dominance of Jerusalem. Mount Gerizim was an important 
religious and political center. The tribes in the north did not all go into 
exile after the Assyrian conquest.&nbsp; Could the rest of what they claimed be 
true too?</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I went to bed that night, and found it hard to fall asleep.&nbsp; I picked up a 
recent issue of Archeology Magazine, and perused an article (by Silberman, 
Finkelstein, Ussishkin and Halpern) about recent finds in Israel at Megiddo, 
which is supposed to be the earthly location of Armageddon.&nbsp; I sat bolt 
upright when I read the words: ‘New evidence may suggest that the first true 
Israelite monarchy...emerged not in Jerusalem but in the rich valleys and cities 
of the north....’ The article went on to explain that it was likely that the 
first real Israeli kingdom arose under northern kings, ‘who are pictured as 
sinful, idol-worshipping villains in the biblical sources.&nbsp; The biblical 
accounts of the northern kingdom that are contained in 2 Kings were heavily 
edited and assembled by the priestly and royal scribes of the south probably no 
earlier than the seventh century B.C.&nbsp;&nbsp; Southern scribes may have 
given the credit for empire-building to the almost legendary King Solomon as a 
means of enhancing the reputation and geographical reach of Judah¹s Davidic 
dynasty. There is a certain irony in viewing the villains of the traditional 
biblical story as heroes of a new archeological tale of political and economic 
development.’</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
There was no sleep that night.&nbsp; I went back over Samaritan sources and 
excerpts from the Samaritan chronicles. There was no mistaking it:&nbsp; the 
truth of the tiny Samaritan community was beginning to gain weight, power and 
prestige against the mighty history of the Bible.&nbsp; The stones were silent 
witnesses to what happened in our human past, and now they are starting to 
speak. </p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In the northern stones and in the Samaritan stories and lifestyle, there are 
tantalizing hints of what happened thousands of years ago, when the Davidic 
monarchy ruled and Judea dominated, taxed and humiliated the tribes of the 
north.&nbsp; The pain and the resentment persist. Even today, Samaritans do not 
name their children Moses or David.&nbsp; If a boy is named Moses and someone 
curses him, he will also be cursing the name of their beloved prophet Moses. As 
for David, no child should be named after him because he is so reviled for his 
attitudes and his deeds.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Anyone who reads the Old Testament (II King 17:29) can read the accusations 
against the Samaritans.&nbsp; They are accused of adoring a god named 
Ashima.&nbsp; But according to historians, this is a misunderstanding.&nbsp; The 
Samaritans wanted to avoid using the Tetragrammaton, the holy name of God, so 
they used the surname ‘Shema’ and this was misinterpreted as their believing 
in</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">Ashima.&nbsp; 
They are reviled for worshipping doves, but there is no evidence that they did 
so.&nbsp; And, as for accusations of idol worship, they were startlingly 
faithful to monotheism, even though there may have been decorative carvings and 
statues (of calves and bulls) in their temples.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Samaritan story would be devoid of urgency and would, at best, be a 
fascinating portal into another version of Biblical history, except for one 
thing.&nbsp; Mount Gerizim is on the West Bank, close to Nablus, which was 
called Shechem in Biblical days and which is now a hotbed of rage and 
violence.&nbsp; Many of the Samaritans children go to school in Nablus, and 
their parents’ work is there.&nbsp; Who can guarantee their safety during the 
current Jewish-Arab violence?&nbsp;&nbsp; When the political dust settles, when 
the West Bank is carved up, who will govern the tiny community of 
Samaritans?&nbsp;&nbsp; Will they fall into the hands of the Israelis or the 
Palestinians? How will the Israelis treat them? How will they fare under the 
Palestinians? They are frightened for their future.&nbsp; Under the last 
Intifada, when they were attacked, Yassir Arafat intervened to offer them 
protection, and he compensated them for injuries sustained.&nbsp; At the 
founding of the State of Israel, President Izhak Ben Zvi took a great interest 
in them, and he helped to establish Holon as a Samaritan community, where they 
could find work that didn¹t exist on Mt. Gerizim.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
But who will care for the Samaritans now?&nbsp; They have sent missions to 
America and Europe and are asking anyone who will listen to give them 
identification cards that ensure their safety, protection and free passage 
through checkpoints, no matter who governs their sacred mountain and their 
city.&nbsp; They want to be identified as Israelite-Samaritans and have their 
future secured. They want political, social, religious and economic 
guarantees.&nbsp; They want help to develop their infrastructure and to 
construct synagogues, schools, research and community centers. They want their 
high priests to be given the same recognition and recompense as rabbis 
get.&nbsp; They want dignity, freedom, and the right to continue their ancient 
way of life. Not only do they face the threat of cultural annihilation because 
of the pulls of western culture on their young, but they face physical, social 
and economic strangulation when their land becomes the playing field for Middle 
Eastern politics. </p>

The more I learn about the Samaritans, the more their plight reminds me of the 
conversos, or crypto-Jews, who have captured the public’s imagination.&nbsp; In 
Spain, during the Inquisition and under the long arm of the Inquisition that 
followed the conversos wherever they went they suffered forced conversions and 
persecutions for their Jewish beliefs.&nbsp; At great peril and with astounding 
courage, they continued to perform their Sephardic traditions.&nbsp; The 
Samaritan-Israelites suffered the same fate and exhibited the same stubborn 
adherence to their faith.&nbsp; But because of their past conflicts with the 
tribe of Jews from the south, they are accorded none of the sympathy and there 
has been little or no outreach.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
We owe it to the Samaritans to recognize their existence and to listen 
objectively to their history. We need to ensure their survival.&nbsp; Who knows 
what secrets from the past may yet be revealed to us through their ancient 
customs, beliefs and practices?&nbsp; The Samaritans plan to tour the USA late 
this year, talking about their culture and sharing their stirring, unique 
music.&nbsp; They are reaching out to us, we need to reach out to them.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
When I was researching the Samaritans, I received an e-mail from Rabbi Gershon 
Winkler, who is never afraid to look the truth in its face.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
‘It is a tragedy to our people that we have dismissed the Samaritans 
theologically and nationalistically,’ Winkler wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘We are not 
whole, not fully tribal, without them.&nbsp; I mean, look what the rabbinate did 
to the Ethiopians, who, too, carried our ancient ways for more than two 
millennia, and then had to reconvert to be part of Israel again.&nbsp; 
Personally - and you can quote me on this - I suspect the authenticity of the 
Jewishness of those rabbis who have the audacity and the arrogance to question 
the Jewish authenticity of Falashas and Samaritans. Samuel the Prophet was right 
in his hesitation to give in to the request of the people that they have kings 
like the other countries around them.&nbsp; Consequently, politics got mixed 
with religion to the point where it replaced spirituality altogether.’</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
‘Samaritans are as non-Jewish as you and I..... Back in those early days, the 
sages of Judea interacted just fine with those of Sumeria, and the two sectors 
lived in respect of one another until the politics of Jerusalem set in around 
the days of Nechemiah and Ezra not long after.’</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
‘In those days ...fundamentalist religious reform was instigated by guys like 
Ezra.&nbsp; Sort of akin to the religious right today who reign supreme in 
Israel, and who dismiss everyone else's Jewishness as suspect.&nbsp; The 
Samaritans have preserved a treasure of richness, pieces of ancient Israel that 
got lost to most of us "real" Jews who got thrown into Babylonia and eventually 
Europe.&nbsp; The Samaritans were not without their own silly politics back 
when, engaging in their own meschugaas in reaction to the rabbinic dismissal of 
their Jewishness. Nonetheless, a few, very few of our rabbis respected them as 
carriers of the old ways.&nbsp; Rabbi Yaakov Emden, for example (18th century), 
wrote about the importance of learning from them to recover some of our lost 
ways.&nbsp; He even included in one of his books the Samaritan version of the 
Hebrew alphabet, which looks nothing like our Hebrew letters today, and which, 
he claims, is older.’</p>
