<p><font color="#FF0000">It should be remembered that for 1400 years, while European Jews saw pogroms, the Inquisition and the Holocaust, Jews were not persecuted in Muslim countries and, indeed, for long periods in Spain and elsewhere, were partners in a marvelous Muslim-Jewish symbiosis. Tensions began after the first Zionist settlers arrived in the 1880's in Palestine.</font>
<p><center><img src="/web/20090318035353im_/http://www.geocities.com/zuhairhm/Zuhair/flowerline.gif">
<p><font color="#009900">When the first Arab-Israeli war was ended by the signing of the four Armistice Agreements between February and July of 1949, the most important question waiting for an answer was this: Could Israel be a <font color="#FF0000">NORMAL </font> state - one that abided by the rules of international law, complied with UN resolutions and generally behaved in a reasonable and responsible way?
<p>Events were to demonstrate that the answer was <font color="#FF0000">NO</font>.
<p> Sharett, one of the Israeli Doves, expressed his sense of despair: <font color="#FF0000">"What is our vision on this earth - war to the end of generations and life by the sword"</font>
<p>In Zionism's version of history, victorious Israel wanted peace and the leaders of the defeated Arab states did not. The truth? As Shlaim said in his revision of Israel's history, <font color="#FF0000">"The files of the Israel Foreign Ministry, for example, burst with evidence of Arab peace feelers and Arab readiness to negotiate with Israel from September 1948 on"</font>
<p>The long life of Zionism's lie was that the record of Israel's responses to the first Arab peace initiatives was locked away in classified state papers and the heads of the participating Israeli diplomats and military men. The <font color="#FF0000">Iron Wall</font> is indispensable reading for those wanting to know in detail what really happened because Shlaim had access to that original source material and interviewed many surviving key players.
<p>Sharett bottled his disappointment and gave priority to political forward planning. On his instruction the MiddleEast department in the Foreign Ministry set about the task of exploring various plans for a Palestinian government. Sharett was in favour of something very like the two-state solution of the partition plan.
<p> Ben-Gurion responded by discouraging polotical planning of any kind while Israel was in a position to exploit in military advantage on the ground -i.e. before the Israeli Army was obliged to stop fighting by Israel's signature on Armistice Agreement.
<p>Ben-Gurion seeked to solve most of the problems by military means, in such a way that no political negotiations and no political action would be of any value.
<p>It was the Syrian leader Hosni Zaim, who offered Israel its best and strategically most significant early opportunity for peace. Sharett was delighted when the UN mediator Dr. Ralph Johnson Bunche indicated his support for the view that Zaim's offer was of the greatest importance and should be taken very seriosly. Ben-Gurion again said <font color="#FF0000">"No"</font>
<p>Ben-Gurion asked Bunche to tell Zaim, there was no question of a meeting of the two leaders until Syria had accepted Israel's terms for an Armistice Agreement. That was an early maniferstation of israel's arrogance of power.
<p> In effect Ben-Gurion was saying something like the following:
<p><font color="#FF0000">Provided we Zionists continue to play the holocaust card for all its worth, and provided we convince the Western world that our little state is in danger of being annihilated we can do what the hell we like in this region."</font>
<p><font color="#FFCC00" size="6">Arab Peace Initiative:</font>
<p><center><font color="#FFCC00" size="4">The initiative was initially published on 28 March 2002<br> in Beirut Summit,<br> and agreed on again in 2007 in the Riyadh Summit</font>
<p>The Arab Peace Initiative (Arabic Language: ������ ������ �������) is a peace initiative first proposed by Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, then crown prince, in the Beirut Summit. The peace initiative is a proposed solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict as a whole, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in particular.
<p>Considered a progressive proposal that would end the Arab-Israeli conflict, it offered full normalization of relations with Israel, in exchange for the withdrawal of its forces from all the Occupied Territories, including the Golan Heights, to recognize "an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital" in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as a "just solution" for the Palestinian refugees.
<p><font color="#FF0000">In 2002, however, the initiative was rejected out of hand by Israel. On the day after the Beirut summit, Israel, with Washington�s support, launched a massive military assault on the West Bank city of Ramallah, surrounding Palestinian President Yasser Arafat�s leadership compound with 60 tanks and pounding it with tank shells. 
This was then followed by Israeli military assaults on the Palestinian cities of Tulkarem, Qalqila, Jenin and Nablus. At the time, it was the biggest Israeli assault on the cities in the West Bank and Gaza since 1967, resulting in hundreds of Palestinian civilians being killed and thousands of others being left homeless.</font>
