<p><font face="Arial">Jericho is a green oasis in the Jordan Valley which lies 7 km west
of the River Jordan, 10 Km north of the Dead Sea and 30 Km east of Jerusalem. It lies 250
meters below sea level and thus it is considered to be the lowest city in the world.<br>
<br>
The origin of the name "Jericho"&nbsp; is Semitic. To the Canaanites it meant
"The Moon". In Syriac the name meant "Scent and odour". The city is
called "The city of Palm" and "The Garden of God".<br>
<br>
Jericho is the oldest city in the world. The ruins of the oldest civilization discovered
in Jericho are 10,000 years old. There are a lot of important and beautiful historical
places to visit in Jericho, such as Old Jericho, River Jordan where Jesus Christ was
baptized, Mount of Temptation, Hisham Palace, Ein Al-Sultan (Elisha) spring, Sycamore
tree, Monastery of Saint George (Wadi Kelt), Hasmoneans (Herod) Palace,Monastery of Dier
hajlah, Kumran Caves, Dead Sea, and a lot more. The nice climate of the city is conducive
to tourism both domestic and International.<br>
<br>
The average temperature in January is 8.5 degrees and the lowest average annual
temperature is 17 degrees. The average annual temperature is 23.5 degrees and the highest
average annual temperature is 30.5 degrees. The average annual amount of rainfall is 150
millimeters, and the average annual humidity is 52%.<br>
<br>
The amount of rainfall in the Jericho area is less than that of the surrounding mountains
and the coastal regions, thus Jericho area relies entirely for drinking and irrigation on
subterranean wells and springs such as the Ein Al-Sultan spring. The source of this water
is situated in the distant mountains. Ein Al-Sultan spring in considered to be the main
source for agriculture. It has an output of 680 cubic meters an hour, and a salinity of
600 fractions in one million. It provides a steady output throughout the year. It is used
equally for drinking water and for irrigating. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In addition to its tourist sites, Jericho is considered to be an
important area for agriculture. It is famous for its citrus fruits, dates, bananas,
flowers and winter vegetables.<br>
<br>
The area within the municipality limits is about 45 square kilometers, and the population
of the city of Jericho alone is 17,000. If we include the population of the surrounding
villages and refugee camps the number goes up to 25,000 inhabitants.</font></p>
