<b>Thank you for the good job of recreating and keeping alive our Palestinian heritage and culture, which had been under attack for more than 100 yrs.,by the criminal acts of Zionism and its lackies and hires in Wshington and western Europe. Never in my heart or the heart of every Arab and Palestinian should the love for Galillee and the rest of occupied Palestine will never fade. Acre my home town is not only in my dream but the dream of every one of us. Our dreams are those of justice and will one day come true again.

<b>URGENT PALESTINIAN RIGHTS
<p>
Dear friends, 
<p>
Please take a moment to sign the online petition at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000818111045/http://rightofreturn.org/petition/index.html">http://rightofreturn.org/petition/index.html</a>. The petition reaffirms the inalienable right of every Palestinian to individual and absolute restitution of his/her property, and the right to return to their original home. The petition is sponsored by The Council for Palestinian Restitution and Repatriation (CPRR), an organization recently established to provide legal aid to Palestinians and their heirs to achieve their legitimate rights. 
<p>
The inalienable rights of Palestinians to restitution and repatriation are solidly anchored in a wide range of international resolutions and conventions, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and numerous UN resolutions, and apply equally to past, current and future generations. As such, they can neither be granted nor abrogated by others. 
<p>
At this time, it is urgent that all people of conscience stand together to counter the escalating pressure on Palestinians to surrender their rights and to remind all of the inalienable nature of these rights.
<p>
CPRR's work is an essential part of the Palestinian people's struggle or justice. But its success depends on your support. We invite you to become a member of CPRR to help Palestinians secure their rights. By becoming a member of CPRR you will automatically add your name to the Right to Return Campaign. For more information visit http://rightofreturn.org or write to CPRR, P.O. Box 21520, Washington D.C. 20009, USA, fax (1) (775) 418-5980, e-mail: info@rightofreturn.org 
<p>
In solidarity,

<b>Dear freinds,
I would like to thank your team for your efforts to keep the memories of the great people , and remind us that we have a long heritage. 
I suggest that the Sakakini Centre can be a place where a group of intersted people meet twice a month to discuss a palestinian work (novels, peotry, any kind of literature...)which can help people who share same intersts meet and discuss these works. 
Anyway, I always enjoy your programs, good job.
Love
Abeer </b><br>

<b>ISrael will always control the area no matter what the fuck you or your stupid bomb-dropping, sheep fucking, unhygenic motherfuckers like it or not.  I may be acting immaturely and undiplomatically but, I dont give a fuck.  Jews control the world, they control America, they control Russia, (myself included in that) and no matter what fucking emails you send aroudn about, it will always be the Arabs causing the problems because you are an evil nation, and the world knows it.  The only reason teh Arabs are actually shown respect is because of the oil.  WIthout oil, you would be just another waste of space like the Africans, and whoever else you want to figure in the picture. The reason there are checkpoints is because you fuckers dont go bombing innocent children and women.  You wil have your state, most likely, so go your separate way, but you will never get anything more than the West Bank. Jerusalem will remain united forever, and my billions of dollars as well as money from people around teh world, and Israel;s military, the best in the world, will keep fuckers like you in your place.

I miss home very much and I am just dreaming about the day that I will live again in Jerusalem, and will be able to see such exhibits and other art activities in Khalil Sakakini Center.

<b>I grew up in the Arab-Lutheran Parsonage next to KSCC building, and have many and beautiful memories playing hide-and-seek in its rooms and garden during my childhood days. I also have other sour memories of hiding from Israeli soldiers (again in its rooms and garden) during the horrible days of Israeli-imposed curfews on us civilians. I still clearly remember the wonderful smiles of our dear family friends Dumia and Hala Sakakini whenever we walk through al-Nuzha Street going to downtown Ramallah. I cannot begin to explain how thrilled I was to learn that that building is now named after a man that I respect and am close friends with his family.

<b>Good, and very impressive idea.  The fact that this foundation is that of a teacher is a an indication of how loyal you are to future generations and the cause of the Arab Palestine.  Unlike most Arab countries, who seem to name everything after its princes, princess and  the rest of the dictators.  I like the Idea of the program on the "Nakbeh". I hope that you take the program international wide, through donations of generous Palestinians living abroad (.....), this program may take a trip around the world to inform about the suffering and the ongoing tyranny on the Palestinian people.  One special place you might take it to Jordan  And not to forget that the children of the " Nakbeh" still reside the metal shacks in the Palestinian camps without even the most basic human service there is.Look forward to see you in America.
