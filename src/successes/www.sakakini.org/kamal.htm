<p><div align="justify">This show is the fruit of a collaboration between Boullata &amp; the
Syro-Lebanese poet Adonis. After a joint 1995 visit to the Alhambra, Adonis
wrote a poem in homage to Granada, &amp; Boullata executed 12 serigraphs
(silk screens) echoing the architectural motifs &amp; colors of the Alhambra,
also following up on his two-year research into geometric patterns in Islamic
art in Morocco and Spain. 
<p>With the support of the UNESCO, 50 linen &amp; wood hand-crafted cases
containing the serigraphs &amp; 2 books of Adonis' poem were made, &amp;
distributed to selected heads of state &amp; art institutions around the
world. The books are of an accordion format, &amp; feature 3-dimensional
carved pop-ups echoing some architectural motifs of the Alhambra (a picture
of the book can be seen in the Sakakini October 98 News section).
<p>The serigraphs are divided into 3 triptychs, each named for one of the
4 rivers believed to exist in Paradise, 2 of which were named after springs
in Palestine (Bisan and Jaihun). The 4-river motif is also found in the
Lions' Courtyard of the Alhambra.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>This exhibit -viewed for the first time after its 1998 Alhambra opening-&nbsp;
is made possible by the UNESCO's donation of all the works exhibited to
the Sakakini. We hope to display the series the near future in a permanent
gallery, along with other works of art donated to the Centre.
