        </b>Here the dead are carousing </dt>
    <dt>Here they shake their heads </dt>
    <dt>to the music of shroud bells.<br>

    <dt><b>Emigration <br>
        </b>They're all gone </dt>
    <dt>towards that place in the North </dt>
    <dt>where the grasses grow </dt>
    <dt>to the height of their breasts </dt>
    <dt>They left behind them </dt>
    <dt>tattered strips from their children's clothes </dt>
    <dt>and the pegs of their tents </dt>
    <dt>They're gone </dt>
    <dt>Their children on the backs of mules </dt>
    <dt>Their youths carrying baskets </dt>
    <dt>and their sheep's bells </dt>
    <dt>They were like a cloud </dt>
    <dt>climbing up to heaven </dt>
    <dt>The more they penetrated the land </dt>
    <dt>the more their shadows expanded </dt>
    <dt>and returned towards the camps </dt>
    <dt>Their dogs were mute </dt>
    <dt>They would surpass the migrating crowd , then sit down </dt>
    <dt>their eyes watching </dt>
    <dt>the moving shadows </dt>
    <dt>as they ran back ward </dt>
    <dt>like a dark river.</dt>
