    <dt><b>Houses</b>:<br>
        The cloud of migration is in his eyes, </dt>
    <dt>and in the leather briefcase the book, the pencil, the
        family photograph </dt>
    <dt>the rust of benches on his hands, the rust of bannisters
        and doorknobs, </dt>
    <dt>the rust of handshakes on his hands. </dt>
    <dt>The briefcase propped against the wall- </dt>
    <dt>will he take out his souvenirs first, or will he </dt>
    <dt>like a magician take out a country: </dt>
    <dt>a house, </dt>
    <dt>a street, </dt>
    <dt>a capital. </dt>
    <dt>He closed his eye, lay back against the shoulder of
        familiar habits. </dt>
    <dt>He will not make friends with another vase, </dt>
    <dt>he will not confess to a bed that will blow up in the
        next war, </dt>
    <dt>he will not make tea or sing. </dt>
    <dt>He will pace back and forth for a long time betwthe porch
        and </dt>
    <dt>the kitchen </dt>
    <dt>and he will listen hard for a sound coming from the
        garden gate. </dt>
    <dt>But there is only the crunching of leaves under feet </dt>
    <dt>passing </dt>
    <dt>then </dt>
    <dt>going on; </dt>
    <dt>there is nothing but the hum of talk in the houses next
        door. </dt>
