This special exhibition showcased part of the private collection of contemporary Palestinian art by the single most important Palestinian collector of such art: Mazen Qupty -who also happens to be the Sakakini's chairman of the board of directors-. Over the last 15 years, Mazen &amp; his wife Yvette acquired works of art by the best local and Diaspora artists, amassing a collection of a hundred works. The collection displayed at the Centre featured works by Nabil Anani, Slimane Mansour, Tayseer Sharaf, Vera Tamari, Rana Bishara, Vladimir Tamari, Kamel Moghani, Fathi Ghaben, Kamal Boullata, Assad Azzi, and Taleb Dweik. The exhibit was thus named in memory of Palestinian refugees massacred in 1976 in their refugee camp in Lebanon.    At the opening, Qupty -a native of Nazareth- spoke movingly of his love for art in general, for Palestinian art in particular and the need to support it, and how his collection was a symbol of the unity of Palestinians across artificial borders -West Bank, Gaza, Israel, Diapsora- and how arts and culture are the unifiers of Palestinian everywhere.
