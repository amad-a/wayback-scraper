<p><font size="+1">Badr published her first novel in Beyrouth in 1979, "A
Compass for the Sunflower". She has also published short story collections,
novellas, a children's book, a poetry collection, and a book about poet
Fadwa Touqan. Her works have been translated into a number of languages.
Her works mainly focus on themes of women and war, and exile. Her style
has been described by the Times Literary Supplement as "defy the laws of
fictional gravity", and "densely lyrical".</font>

of the time.</font>

UK, and in 1992 into French by Metropolis in Geneva.</font>
