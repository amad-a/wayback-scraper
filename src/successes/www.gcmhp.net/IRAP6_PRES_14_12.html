The Sixth International Research and Advisory Panel (IRAP) Conference on
Forced Migration completed its second day in Jerusalem.&nbsp; The conference
in jointly presented by the International Association for the Study of
Forced Migration (IASFM) and the Gaza Community Mental Health Program (GCMHP).&nbsp;
The conference continues until 16 December.
<p>The plenary session this morning featured presentations by Mr. Patrick
Taran of the Refugee and Migration Service of the World Council of churches,
Geneva, and Professor James Hathaway of the University of Michigan Law
School.&nbsp; Mr. Taran's talk focused on globalization, migration, and
human rights.&nbsp; He discussed the different meaning of the word 'globalization'
and about the consequences of globalization processes for migrants.&nbsp;
He pointed out that developing countries are crippled by their debt servicing
obligations, and that as a result their efforts to provide adequate social
services to their citizens are severely impaired.&nbsp; Mr. Taran also
linked globalization to the rise of ethnic regrouping and religious fundamentalism.&nbsp;
Attitudes to foreigners in developed countries are increasingly hostile,
and they have become stigmatized as a threat to society.&nbsp; He worried
that the designation of certain kinds of migrants as 'illegal immigrants'
puts them outside the applicability of international legal instruments
designed to protect their rights.&nbsp; He argues that this in a dangerous
precedent because other marginal groups in society may also be denied their
basic rights in the future.&nbsp; He called for increased efforts to expand
the international legal system.
<p>Professor Hathaway disagreed with Mr. Taran's analysis in his presentation.&nbsp;
Rather than create ever more declarations of rights, he called for the
academic community to help make the already existing legal instruments
work better, and for researchers to concentrate on concrete proposals to
help real suffering people.&nbsp; He argued that the current international
refugee regimes is in crisis because governments have failed to "add content"
to their formal legal obligations.&nbsp; He explained his opinion that
the international refugee regime is not designed to address the "root causes"
of forced migration.&nbsp; Rather, it is a palliative system designed to
protect the rights of victims of conflict.&nbsp; Professor Hathaway analyzed
the tendency of states to withdraw from their duty to protect refugees
as due to two factors.&nbsp; First, states fear the refugee admissions
amount to an uncontrolled 'back door' route to permanent immigration.&nbsp;
Second, the real costs associated with the arrival of refugees are not
distributed equally among refugee-receiving countries.&nbsp; He called
for reform of the existing system, and for the UN High Commission for Refugees
to focus more on its protection mandate and leave humanitarian intervention
to the many specialized agencies that already fulfill this function.&nbsp;
He then presented the proposals of his research group on how to effect
the necessary reforms.
<p>This afternoon's workshops focus on:
<br>1- Palestinian Refugees, International Law, and Asylum in the Arab
World
<br>2- New Asylum Laws in African Countries
<br>3- Differing Definitions of What the Situation is in Forced Migration
and Resettlement
<br>4- Psychosocial Work with Refugees in Sub-Saharan Africa
<br>5- Origins and Consequences of Camps in East Africa
<br>6- Asylum Procedures and Security Issues
<br>7- Perspectives on Mental health Care of Refugees Preparing for Repatriation
<br>8- Policy and Practice in and around Camps in East Africa
<br>9- Refugee Causing Conflicts and Conflict Generating Refugee Diaspora
in Africa.
