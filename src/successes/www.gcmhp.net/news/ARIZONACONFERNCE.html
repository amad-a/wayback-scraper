<p>From 11-14 July 1999, Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj participated in the Global
Conference on Universities and the Health of the Disadvantaged organized
by WHO, UNESCO, and the University of Arizona.&nbsp; The conference discussed
ways of enhancing the role of universities in the development of disadvantaged
societies.&nbsp; Representatives of universities in the USA, Europe, Africa,
Asia, and Latin America attended; also, researchers and specialists in
social sciences, curriculum-design, capacity-building participated in the
conference.
<p>In his presentation, Dr. El-Sarraj said, "It is essential to know the
causes of deprivation in order to put forth solutions.&nbsp; We must admit
that colonialism, uprooting, and organized violence by governments against
the people are the most important reasons.&nbsp; In addition, the control
of power and resources by a small group is a cause of deprivation."&nbsp;
He emphasized that women and children constitute the majority of the victims.&nbsp;
Dr. El-Sarraj called upon universities to break away from traditional roles
and interact with society in order to ensure the respect of human rights
and the rule of law.
<p>Dr. El-Sarraj declared, "The true participation in building one's country,
the right to self-determination, and work towards ensuring the future of
one's children is the foundation for developing the people in a democratic
and peaceful way."
<p>The conference declared the "Arizona Charter" (full charter attached)
that calls upon universities to revitalize their role in society.

On July 11-14, 1999, WHO, UNESCO and the University of Arizona co-convened
a global conference in Tucson, Arizona, specifically to address the topic
of universities and the Health of the Disadvantaged. The goals of the conference
were to draw lessons from the experiences of universities, establish partnerships,
promote development of sustainable programs, facilitate worldwide exchange
of information, carry out collaborative projects and encourage global coalitions
between and among universities, local governments, and communities to improve
the health of the disadvantaged.
<p>Pursuant to the Declaration and Framework for Priority Action set by
the World Conference on Higher Education at UNESCO in October 1998, the
Agenda for Social Development adopted by the world Summit on Social Development
in Copenhagen, in March 1995, and the resolution adopted by the World Health
Assembly in 1984, urging member states to mobilize universities in favor
of strategies promoting Health for All, the participants in the global
conference on Universities and the Health of the Disadvantaged assert their
intention to harmonize and implement the results produced by the aforementioned
three documents.
<p>Universities have a unique potential to stimulate progress and construct
better and more equitable societies. Their long-standing traditions of
advocating humanism, social justice, peace and development bestow upon
universities an obligation to commit themselves to maximize this potential
especially on behalf of the most disadvantaged populations. In this Charter,
disadvantaged populations are defined as those groups with diminished capacity
to take advantage of opportunities for better health.
<p>Universities should take the initiative in developing and mediating
multidimensional action plans for improving the health of the disadvantaged
by playing a catalytic role in mobilizing the various resources needed.
Properly motivated and supported, they can facilitate the convergence of
disparate interests and create coalitions among key players in governments,
health professions, and communities. Universities have a wide spectrum
of responsibilities in education, research, and service delivery, a capacity
to engage in multidisciplinary interventions; and an ability to develop
alliances with other constituencies.
<p>University must base their long-term orientations on societal aims and
needs, reinforcing their role of service to society, especially with regard
to activities aimed at eliminating poverty, intolerance, violence, illiteracy,
hunger, environmental degradation, and disease, and other factors responsible
for the existence of disadvantaged populations. This will prepare citizens
who are able to think clearly, analyze problem, make appropriate choices,
act ethically, and assume social responsibilities.
<p>To achieve these ends, we affirm that collaboration, partnership and
advocacy should also be integral parts of the mission of universities.
Successful, productive, responsible education, service and research require
genuine collaboration within and among academic institutions and communities,
governments and other key stakeholders.
<p>Finally, all universities have a moral imperative to engage in service
to disadvantaged communities, regardless of their source of support or
status as public or private institutions.
<p>Therefore, we call for Universities to:
<p>&nbsp;? Recognize and respect the legitimacy and dignity of disadvantaged
populations.
<br>&nbsp;? Take responsibility and accept accountability for addressing
the health and welfare needs of disadvantaged populations.
<br>&nbsp;? Give priority to research on the special problems of disadvantaged
communities, on understanding the underlying determinants of poverty and
inequity, and on approaches to reducing the disparity in health status.
<br>&nbsp;? Mobilize and coordinate the activities of all appropriate academic
disciplines, and not just those in the health sciences, to address the
complex issues associated with the health of the disadvantaged.
<br>&nbsp;? Ensure students are motivated and appropriately equipped to
serve disadvantaged populations, to be community-responsive citizens and
to function as agents of social change.
<br>&nbsp;? Influence the development of public policy and the implementation
of programs to improve the health and well-being of the disadvantaged.
<br>&nbsp;? Diversify university faculties and student bodies by increasing
recruitment of faculty and matriculation of students from disadvantaged
populations, including specific efforts to strengthen the pool of disadvantaged
applicants.
<br>&nbsp;? Create a forum (network) that promotes social accountability
of academic institutions and supports their efforts to improve the health
of disadvantaged population.
<p>Building on the contacts which we have made at this global conference,
we commit ourselves to exchange information and experiences by networking
among partners and using this information to initiate change in our respective
institutions to address the heath of the disadvantaged with the active
support of international agencies such as WHO and UNESCO.
