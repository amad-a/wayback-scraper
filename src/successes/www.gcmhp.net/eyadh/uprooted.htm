CONFERENCE ON THE MENTAL HEALTH AND PSYCHOSOCIAL WELLBEING OF REFUGEES
AND DISPLACED PERSONS".</font>
<p><font color="#000066">OCTOBER 6-11, 1991.</font>
<br><font color="#000066">STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN,</font>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Early History</font></b>
<br><font color="#000066">Both the Arabs and the Jews trace their origins
back to their patriarch Abraham. The Hebrew tribes, known as the Children
of Israel, embarked on the conquest of Canaan (as Palestine was then known)
in the 13th and 12th centuries BCE, at about the same time as the Philistines
(from whom the name Palestine derives) were taking possession of the coastal
area. The Hebrews established the Israelite kingdom, whihe reached its
peak under King David around 1000 BC, before splitting into a northern
kingdom and the southern kingdom of Judah.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">After some centuries of subjection to other powers,
an attempt to restore an independent kingdom ended with the Roman conquest
of the area in 63 BC. The Jewish people rebelled and then over a century
later, the Romans undertook the reconquest of the country, taking Jerusalem
by storm and destroying its temple. After further revolts, the Emperor
Adrian finally expelled all Jews from Jerusalem in AD 135.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">The Arab Muslim conquest of Palestine was completed
in Ad 640 ; but, it took over a century for the majority of the population
to embrace the Muslim faith (10-15% of the Palestinians still adhere to
Christianity). The first four Muslim caliphs (i.e. successors to the prophet
Mohammed) ruled from Arabia, after which Damascus became the seat of the
Arab Empire. Except for the interlude when a series of Crusader kingdoms
ruled parts of the eastern Mediterranean basin in the 12th and 13th centuries,
the region remained under asuccession of Muslim regimes, including 400
years of the Ottoman Turks, until the end of World War I. (El Sarraj, 1991).
The Palestinians of today are the descendants of the Canaanites, the Philistines
and other early tribes which inhabited the country, including Greeks, Romans,
Arabs, European Crusaders and the Turks. (M. Menuhin, 1965).</font>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Seeds of Conflict</font></b>
<p><font color="#000066">The Palestinian modern time tragedy of today goes
back to the early days of the twentieth century when the Zionist movement
was created as a reaction to the anti-semitism and persecution of Jews
in Europe. The declared goal of Zionism was to establish a Jewish home
in Palestine. This movement coincided in time with a changing world scene
and redistribution of power. While the Ottoman Empire was disintegrating,
Britain and France were poised to spread their colonisation and exploitation
of what we know today as the Third World. In the Sykes-Picot agreement,
they decided to divide the Middle East between themselves (J.e. Hurewitz).
Soon after the War, it was so arranged that Britain was "delegated" by
the league of Nations to have mandate over inhabitants for independence."
But already Britain had, in the name of it's foreign minister, declared
it's sympathy towards the Zionist plan of establishing a home for the Jews
in Palestine. The declaration, contained in a letter addressed to Lord
Rothchild, came to be known as the Balfour declaration (J. Davis 1968).</font>
<p><font color="#000066">The Zionists affectively used Britain's presence
in Palestine to faeilitate Jewish immigration into Palestine. This immigration
triggered the Palestinians to resist-sometimes violently-the obvious concerted
attempt of transform their country into a Jewish state. Britain increasingly
came under pressure from different directions; while the Palestinians were
demanding on immediate halt to Jewish immigration and the implementation
of the intent of the League of Nations Mandate, namely their Independence,
the Zionist movement was exerting its powerful influence to allow for the
free entry of Jewish immigrants to Palestine. Such a call held particular
persuasive power in the wake of the Holocaust and the resulting European
guilt over the event.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">Following the second World War the United Nations
debated the future of Palestine. It decided to partition the country into
two states: one Jewish and one palestinian. The Jews, who formed 30% of
the total population, were given 56% of the land (Fig.1). The Palestinians
objected, and the confrontation between the two sides escalated.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">The Americans, winners of the war, came into the
picture in their own fashion and for their own reasons. Preoccupied with
the presidential election, and concerned about the Jewish vote, the American
president, Harry Truman, ordered the post war economically shattered Britain
to open the doors of Palestine for the Jews. Amidst confusion , turmoil
and violence, Britain decided that it was leaving Palestine.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">Immediately the Zionist movement speeded its activities
to control the country, mainly by waging a campaign of terror and psychological
warfare. The campaign culminated in the Deir Yasseen massacar, which lead
to a mass exodus of unprotected civilians. According to the eye witness
account of the International Red Cross representative, 254 men, women,
and children were slaughtered and many of their bodies were stuffed into
a well (J. Davis, 1968 ). Sir Herbert Samuel, a Jew, himself, and the High
Commissioner of Palestine, testified on the event before the House of lords
: <b>" The Jewish people have always taken pride in the good deeds and
the distinction won by their members....Today these same people have given
birth to a set of assassins...I feel bound to say that the Jewish population
of Palestine and the Jewish Agency are blameworthy for not having extirpated
this curse which has brought shame upon all members of the Jewish community.</b>
<b>"( 23/4/1947, The House of Lords debate on Palestine).</b> The wide
spread terror and fear, which was instrumental in forcing the Palestinian
villagers to flee for safety, was welcomed by Menachem Begin who subsequently
wrote:" The villagers were seized with limitless panic and started to flee
for their lives. " (M. Begin,1951). Then the Zionist forces employed the
tactics of spreading rumours among the villages that "the attachers would
repaeat what they did in Deir Yasseen". Igal Allon, the head of the Jewish
strike force, "The Haganah", wrote later: " I gathered all the Jewish Mukhtars,
and asked them to whisper in the ears of the Arabs that a great Jewish
force has arrived in the Galilee and they are going to burn the Arab villages."
(W. Khalidi, 1961). The plan of emptying Palestine pf ots majority Arab
population and the transformation of the country into an exclusive Jewish
state was succeeding. The demographic changes in Palestine between 1918
and 1948 ( fig.2) show the extent of Jewish influx into the country: on
increase of more than 400%. To consolidate their gaims and to block any
attempt of the Palestinians to claim a right to return, the new Israeli
government demolished and destroyed hundreds of Arab villages. (Benny Morris,
1987, Fig.3). "A country without people for a people without a country"
was the slogan of the Zionist propaganda. In the absence of any effective
Arab resistance, Israel embarked on the obliteration of the history of
the Palestinians. Indeed, the Palestinian tragedy was blocked from the
conscience of the world.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">In May 1948, Israel declared its statehood in
Palestine. The Arab masses in the neighbouring countries were enraged and
demanded action from their regimes, all of which were unprepared and unwilling
to go to war. These regimes were imposed on the people by the dominant
foreign powers, who were sympathetic to the Zionist movement. But to save
face seven Arab countries sent their armies into Palestine "to restore
law and order." In his memoirs , the British Commander of the Arab Legion
confirmed the absence of the intention to fight in the Arab side (J.b.Glubb,
1959). But the declared intention to "fight until Liberation" provided
fuel for Zionist propaganda, which pleaded to the "civilised world" to
protect them from the Arabs, who were out to throw the Jews into the sea.</font>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Life in the Diaspora</font></b>
<p><font color="#000066">Following the four-week "war", nearly one million
Palestinians became refugees(annual report of the Sec. General of the United
Nations 1/7/1948-30/6/1949,p.102). They found themselves dumped into refugee
camps in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. In
1950 after it had failed to implement its revalution on their repatriation
(resolution, etc.) the United Nations established a special body , UNRWA
, to help the Palestinian refugees. In fact, the UN General Assembly reaffirmed
resolution 194 every year in its discussion of the Palestine Question.
But it was to no avail since Israel remained opposed to repatriation, contrary
to its declared obligation upon its admission to the UN in May 1949.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">When they started their journey fleeing the war,
many Palestinians believed that they would soon return after the Arab armies
had liberated the land. They were mistaken. They had gradually to comprehend
what had happened, and how it all went wrong. The deep shocke and sense
of helplessnes, the memory of being uprooted from their homes, and the
experience of relying on charity and hand-outs had a profound impact on
the</font>
<p><font color="#000066">individual and collective psyche of the Palestinians.
The oldes generation felt guilty and ashamed and tried to block the memories
from the young. Flashbacks, dreams and nightmares haunted the people.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">Some were busy occupying themselves with day to
day survival, finding employment, feeding their children many of whom were
forced to beg for food in the streets of Beirut or Damascus (F. Turki,
1988).</font>
<p><font color="#000066">The structure of the Palestinian society was suddenly
shattered; families were separated and clans were dismembered. Some lost
their loved ones in fighting or during the exhausting journey to exile,
and some are still unaccounted for.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">The Palestinians were mainly farmers and villagers
and it was these persons who were hardest hit by the abrupt and painful
changes. They left every thing behind: the simple content village life,
the warm neighbourhood and the close relations, and above all the land,
their life-line, security, and hope. Added to this was the painful realisation
that their skills were not needed in the host countries, whose own peasant
population was barely surviving. They were unemployable and their skills
disappeared since they could not train their children when there was no
land.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">Today the Palestinians number nearly five million:
two million of them live in the West bank and Gaza, around one million
in Jordan, one million in the other Arab countries, and one million in
the rest of the world (Fig.4). Two million Palestinians are currently registered
with UNRWA whose operations cover the Occupied territories,Jordan, Syria,
and Lebanon. UNRWA provides shelter, basic food, primary health care, and
elementary education for the registered refugees. Further education and
secondary health services are dependent on the host countries.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">The Palestinians appreciated the significance
of education. The new generation was encouraged to pursue university and
higher 10 education, and they took advantage of the free education offered
to them, particularly in Egypt. From the mass of refugees some streamed
to the oil rich Gulf states where they were respected as successful teachers,
doctors, engineers and business men. These persons remitted some of their
income to their families left behind in the refugee camps. But that relative
security was not to last; in the aftermath of the Gulf War, 300,000 Palestinians
were expelled from Kuwait and many hundreds were tortured, raped or killed.</font>
<p><b><font color="#000066">From refugees to revolutionaries</font></b>
<p><font color="#000066">Following the "Catastrophe", as their uprooting
came to be known, the Palestinians began a painful soul searching. They
felt guilt and helplessness in the face of the conspiracy and the superiority
of the Zionist and colonial powers and they blamed the Arab regimes for
failing to stand against the common enemy. Other Arab populations were
also unhappy with these regimes and soon revolutions and popular disturbances
broke out in Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and other countries.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">The most significant development in the area following
the Catastrophe was the 1952 revolution in Egypt. The leaders of the Revolutionary
Command Council declared that they were determined to rid Egypt of the
corrupt King, a puppet of the English, and liberate Egypt from colonial
domination. They claimed that the defeat of Egypt in Palestine was determined
before going to battle by the King and his regime (G.A. Nasser, 1953).
The revolutionaries in Egypt became a symbol in the Arab World and a source
of inspiration from Algiers to Iraq. They championed the Arab national
dream of liberation , unity, and social justice. The Palestinians idolised
Nasser, who became the unchallenged leader of the Arabs every where.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">In the absence of a Palestinian leader Nasser
became a Hero and more. He became a father.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">Egypt, in effect, posed a threat to the domination
of foreign Western powers in the Third World. The new revolutionaries were
inspiring the masses every where to liberate their countries. Britain,
France and Israel decided to wage a war against Egypt, each with a special
aim in mind. They secretly concocted a plan to invade Egypt, and in October
1956, they did. But public opinion in Britain and France, and pressure
from the United States and the Soviet Union, forced them to withdraw. (A.
Nutting, 1967). The war has never ended.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">In the wake of the Egyptian revolution and the
ever repeated vows and slogans by the Arabs to "liberate the Land", and
largely due to the feeling of helplessness, the Palestinians relied on
the Arabs to help them regain their home and on the United Nations and
the World conscious to implement UN resolutions which called for their
return. Gradually the Palestinians were convinced that they could only
rely on themselves. The call for organising the Palestinians and for armed
struggle was rapidly gaining ground among a new generation of disillusioned
youth.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) was
proclaimed in Jerusalem in 1964, uniting all the under ground guerilla
factions which spanned the political spectrum from left to right.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">More significantly, the establishment of the PLO
began a new era of Palestinian nationalism. The Palestine National Council
became their Parliament in exile, and the PLO became a home in waiting
and a government for every Palestinian.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">&nbsp;The PLO and its factions declared war on
Israel on all fronts. The political scene was changing rapidly, and the
Palestinians case was a dominant and central issue in the Middle East.
The rise of the PLO threatened Israel, which promptly decided to act. It
launched the Six Day War in June 1967 against Egypt, Syria and Jordan.
Within six days it had occupied the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai
desert, the Golan heights, and East Jerusalem (Fig.5). The war resulted
in the displacement of a further 350,000 Palestinians, of whom 175,000
become refugees a second time( UNRWA 1982).</font>
<p><font color="#000066">In the first few years of the occupation, the
Palestinians put up a stiff armed resistance in both Gaza and the West
Bank. They were supported by PLO bases which had been established across
the border in Jordan. Jordan, where the majority of Palestinians live,
preceived the PLO as threat to its stability. In the subsequent confrontation
the PLO was driven out of Jordan, leaving behind thousands of dead and
injured and a legacy of deep mistrust and suspicion. One of the consequences
of the violent confrontation was the further radicalisation and the birth
of Black September, an under ground splinter group with the declared intention
of revenge.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">The PLO founded a new base in Lebanon, and it
rapidly began to dominate over Palestinian affairs and later became an
influential party in the complex Lebanese political situation. The multiplying
military bases were used to launch attacks on the northern border of Israel,
which was continuously retaliating by bombing the Palestinian refugee camps
and the bases themselves. In short, the PLO presence was neithetolerated
by Israel nor by Lebanon and, for that matter, by the Syrian regime, who
wanted to control the politics in this area.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon. After six months
of heavy bombardment and intense war, Israel occupied the southern part
of Lebanon and forced the PLO out. This time the PLO went to Tunisia, and
its forces were dispersed between several Arab countries. The destruction
of the PLO's physical presence in Lebanon crippled the Palestinian resistance
movement. Finaly, however, due to the terrible blood shed and destruction
the world began to take note of the Palestinian tragedy.</font>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Life under Israeli occupation</font></b>
<p><font color="#000066">For the last twenty five years the Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza have been living under military occupation. The
central aim of the occupation is two fold: first to gain more land and
further the realisation of "Greater Israel", and second to add strategic
depth and security to Israel. There is a third aim which is to use the
territories in any future negotiations to obtain both Arab acceptance of
Israel and American financial compensation (This third Israeli strategy
proved successful in the peace treaty with Egypt, The Camp David Agreement
of 1979).</font>
<p><font color="#000066">The Israeli policies in the Occupied Territories
have been condemned both world-wide and inside Israel itself. Criticism
has focused mainly on disregard for basic human rights and on the policy
of confiscating Palestinian land for Israeli settlement purposes. Many
Israeli and international groups have monitered humman rights abuses by
the Israeli occupation authorities, including.. Amnesty International,
Physicians for Human rights, Israeli Mental Health Workers for Peace (IMUT),
and Israeli Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights to name a few. Beside
the denial of basic human rights, the Israelis have also implemented harsh
economic measures.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">Palestinians not present in the Occupied Territories
when the 1967 war broke out have been denied the right to return to their
homes except for visits or under limited family reunion provisions. (By
contrast, under the 1950 Law of Return, Jews are allowed to come from any
part of the world to live in Israel as full citizens.)</font>
<p><font color="#000066">Since 1967, more than 50% of the land of West
Bank and 40% of the land of Gaza has been confiscated by the Israeli occupation
authorities for military and settlement purposes. (M. Benivisti, 1986).
Thousands of landless Palestinians have been absorbed into the Israeli
economy as cheap, unskilled and semiskilled labourers. Neverthless, unemployment-
with no state benefits - is very high, especially in Gaza where two thirds
of the 730,000 people live in eight refugee camps. Families of 10-15 are
squeezed in two or three rooms in poor hygienic conditions which contributed
to the high infant mortality rate (70 per 1000).</font>
<p><font color="#000066">Palestinian farmers who have managed to keep their
land have been subjected to military restrictions which control the use
of water wells. Meanwhile, Israelis have dug deeper wells in order to divert
the water to the Jewish settlements (M. Lowi). As a result of these and
other measures, the Israeli occupation has crippled the Palestinian economy
and the Occupied Territories have become Israel's second largest export
market.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">Palestinians are denied freedom of speech, meeting,
travelling, publishing, and they are punished for expressing their national
identity in any form. Even wearing a dress made of the colours of the flag
or singing a national song can be considered a crime against the state.
More than 67,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip alone have been imprisoned
by the Israelis since the beginning of the occupation in 1967. This figure
takes on greater importance when one considers that it does not include
those imprisoned during the Intifada or that the population of the Gaza
Strip dose not exceed 730,000 people. Currently, there are 5,500 Palestinians
from the Gaza Strip who are imprisoned in central prisons for "Security"
reasons. Another 5,700 are being detained in camps such as Ansar 2, Ansar
3, and Ansar 4. (International Red Cross, Gaza).</font>
<p><font color="#000066">The Israeli policies aim to force the majority
of the Palestinians out of the Occupied Terrotirres. The Israelis will
then surround the remainding enclaves with settlements. In 1983, Minister
without Portfolio Porat, announced that within five years, most of the
refugees would be resettled in new residential areas ( Al Quds 1983). In
the meantime the notorious Sharon plan for multiplying the Israeli settlements
throughout Palestinian land is being carried out with vigour, determination
and unashamed contempt for the Fourth Geneva Convention and UN resolutions
(Fig 6). Several military "emergency" or "security" orders have been introduced
in order to create the legal pretext for such policies, such as the Closed
Areas Act of 1949, The Security Areas Act of 1968, and the Usage of Land
Act of 1953 (Kanana 1985).</font>
<p><b><u><font color="#000066">The Intifada:</font></u></b>
<p><font color="#000066">On December 9th., 1987, the Palestinian Uprising,
"the Intifada" erupted in the West bank and Gaza. It was a mass movement
of civil disobedience and rebellion against the Occupation.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">The Israeli army's response to the Intifada was
to intensify and expand its brutal and oppressive measures. Shooting and
killing, detention without trial, demolishing homes, torture, deportation,
curfews, breaking bones, and using tear gas were among the most commonly
used methods. The Israeli government has, in addition, waged a harsh economic
war on the Palestinians in retaliation for their refusal to pay taxes and
for their boycot of Israeli products. The Palestinian schools and universities
were closed by military orders for most of the Intifada on the pretext
that they were breeding grounds for rebellion. As well, the Israeli military
has arrested thousands of persons.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">The Israeli forces can detain any Palestinian
without pressing charges for up to 12 months, and the age of criminal responsibility
for the Palestinians has been reduced to twelve. Finally, in the first
33 months of the Intifada, approximately 1,100 Palestinians were shot and
killed. 54% of them were children under the age of 14 years. Twenty two
thousand have been physically injured, 55,000 have been detained, and hundreds
of homes have been demolished (A. E. Nixon, 1990).</font>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Mental Health :</font></b>
<p><font color="#000066">The 1948 Catastrophe has been a central focus
of fear and insecurity which deeply affects the inner layers of the Palestinian
psych. The shock of uprooting and life in exile have resulted in a general
state of helplessness and dependency. Some of the Palestinian new exiles
were hostile.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">As well, the lightening speed of Arab defeat in
1967 and the resulting occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, shocked the
Arab masses but particularly the Palestinians. The dream of</font>
<p><font color="#000066">libration, Arab unity, and victory was suddenly
shattered. Helplessness, victimisation, and paranoia deepened. Unprepared
and unprotected, the Palestinians had to face their very enemy who was
now armed with a sophisticated and modern arsenal.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">For over 40 years the Palestinian community has
been terrorized, haunted by insecurity, an increasing sense of helplessness,
and frustration. This has translated clinically into varied pictures of
psychopathology, particularly depression and anxiety. Drug addiction has
also spread rapidly among the young. Another form of psychopathology has
been the increase of physical and verbal forms of violence and anti-social
behaviour. Families, clans, and political factions have been plagued by
infighting. Finally, men have abused their women and children, the most
helpless and vulnerable members of society. This phenomenon indicates that
Palestinans directed aggression inwardly in a self-destructive reaction
(El Sarraj, 1988).</font>
<p><font color="#000066">Initially, the Intifada transformed the Palestinian
psychology; it restored a positive self-image, high self- esteem and national
pride. Helplessness was replaced over- night by a positive assertiveness.
The individual felt responsible and identified strongly with the national
struggle. Social cohesion replaced the infighting. Depression gave way
to hope, Joy, andmass euphoria. The <u>Intifada</u> was an outlet for the
simmering bottled up anger. The individual and the communal psychic tension
found a legitimate target: The Israeli soldiers.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">&nbsp;Four years on, the picture has changed.
The stagnated political process, and the aggressive Israeli response have
both contributed to the re-emergence of the feelings of frustration, and
calls for radical and violent tactics, particularly in the Gaza Strip,
which in many ways fits the model of a prison. The youth, are prepared
to sacrifice every thing and themselves for the cause of liberation of
the Holy Land. Death is conquered by glorifying the life hereafter. In
this environment, everyone is affected by the overwhelming stress, which
is bound to reactivate new waves of violence. In a pilot study we recently
carried out in Gaza to assess the level of anxiety among adults, we found
that 22% of the adult males and 37% of adult females are suffering from
high to severe anxiety. In the clinical room 45% of the clients have stress-related
disorders (Fig.7).</font>
<p><font color="#000066">According to a study in the West Bank on adult
Palestinians , 64% of the participants were subjected to humiliation ,
harassment, and/or beating (E. Awwad, 1989). The resulting anxiety of the
parents themselves is obviously transmitted to their children.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">Children, experience a variety of stressful events
like being beaten, injured, or witnessing their parents beaten or killed.
Others are terrified by the night raids of the soldiers, and not a small
number had been separated forcibly from their families. These experiences
have left severe marks on the children. In our latest survey of 1500 children
(average age 11 years), we found that 95% of them were tear gassed, 52%
had been beaten, 11.2% detained, 97% had their house raided, 3% had suffered
death in the family, and 1.1% had had their house demolished.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">Baker concluded a study in 1989 with results showing
a high incidence of behavioral problems among Palestinian children (A.
Baker, 1988). Abu Heine concluded his PHD thesis by stating that 28% of
the children expressed profound anxiety in the first six months of the
<u>Intifada</u>. This percentage dropped to 13 % in the following 6 months,
possibly due to adaptation (F. Abu Heine,1988). In a recent study on children
from the Gaza Strip, We found that 60% of them are continuously hyperactive,
22% querulous, 38% easily provoked, 62% are fearful of the soldiers, and
30% wet their beds. (GCMHP, 1990).</font>
<p><font color="#000066">In an apparent contrast, some researchers have
observed that Palestinian children express a high self-esteem in identifying
strongly with their national struggle, and they express a willingness to
participate actively in the struggle ( Punamaki R.L. 1987). What is obvious
from all these studies and observations is that Palestinian children are
suffering from the effects of victimisation while at the same time keeping
a heroic profile at the expense of healthy assimilation of the trauma.</font>
<p><b><u><font color="#000066">Conclusion:</font></u></b>
<p><font color="#000066">Nations are like individuals, each tries to be
the master of his own destiny. Palestinians and Jews are victims of history,
discrimination, and persecution. In their attempt to conquer their history
of victimisation and to change the image of the helpless Jew into a master,
the Jews , victims of yesterday, have turned into the oppressors of today.
What is happening in Palestine today is a desperate battle of wills. The
Palestinian nation is struggling to assert its identity and to heal its
injured dignity. Jacobo Timerman, an Argentinian-born Israeli writes "Nothing
can replace the need of a people to organize into a state in the territory
in whihc they live and which belongs to them. The alternative our government
offers, no matter how it masks it, is to continue repressing the Palestinian
people until we destroy their will to live and liquidate their national
identity. It's incredible that such a policy is being considered by the
very people who demonstrated that this is impossible, that it is immoral,
that it is criminal." (El-Farra 1987)</font>
