<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066"><b><i>The Middle East</i></b> is dominated
by a culture of hatred and hostility. Both Israelis and Arabs were locked
into a viscous circle of violence and destruction which rendered them victims
to uninterrupted wars and hostility.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">I have grown in Gaza in a culture
that hates every thing Jewish. It was always difficult to see the human
being in any Israeli. The Jews, the Zionists, the Israelis where always
the enemy.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">On the other hand the Israeli culture
has been obsessed with the Arab enemy who were all trying to push the Jews
into the sea. Both communities have lived the horrors of war and murder,
and the beastly representation of the enemy. With the emergence of new
times upon the implementation of the peace accord, the Palestinians and
the Israelis are confronting a challenge to their perception of each other
which was always dehumanizing and demonical.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The Middle East conflict between the
Palestinians and Israelis is a deadly battle between two victims. The Israelis;
survivors of a long history of persecution and discrimination are trapped
in their collective memories of brutal suffering which culminated in the
horrors of the Holocaust. In their attempt to change their fate and to
take their destiny into their hands, they were led by the Zionist pioneers
to establish a Jewish home and a Jewish nation. Their choice was the Biblical
land of Palestine and their victims were to become the Palestinians.</font></div>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Palestinians are physically dispersed
in exile and are emotionally traumatized. Their feeling of victimization
is deep. Their experience of trauma is overwhelming and their inner psyche
is injured. Their collective awareness is dominated by the sense of defeat
and helplessness with outbursts of rebellion. Rebellions like the Intifada
are expressions of the will to liberate the self and to take control of
life and usually brings with it a sense of euphoria and belonging. All
their attempts however were cruelly crushed or smothered which deepened
the feelings of helplessness and despair.</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">In the course of their history, Palestinians
have found themselves becoming the Jews of the Middle East. They suffer
persecution and discrimination in every corner of the Middle East and most
painfully in their own country. Their uprooting in 1948 from their homes
and villages in Palestine has left an inner focus of fear and insecurity.
Victims of a what they perceived as a grand scheme of colonial Zionism
and imperialism, they suddenly found themselves in refugee camps both inside
their country and in the neighboring Arab countries. Later in the their
years they were to live under the total control of the their same enemy
and to endure a harsh life under the military occupation.</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">From the early days of their uprooting
Palestinians pioneered and joined the Arab national movement as the vehicle
for liberation and return. The failure of Arab nationalism and the death
of Nasser left the Arab masses bewildered and lost for a direction. It
is this environment of defeat and helplessness that has paved the way for
the Palestinian national movement and later the radical Islamic groups.
They offer people the alternative to death through redemption and the return
to God.</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Arabs in general have little confidence
in their leaders as genuine players in the global political game. They
are perceived as mere helpless pawns. Indeed, Arabs feel that they were
essentially betrayed by those leaders who rule their people by force but
are impotent in combatting the enemy.</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">There were brief moments in their recent
history when Palestinians felt and tasted victory. In the first year of
the Intifada there was a state of euphoria when Palestinians were ignited
to join the popular uprising. Participation in the Intifada meant that
every one was able to exercise control over destiny and events. The heightened
morale has allowed Palestinians to see themselves as equal to the Israelis
when they confronted the military forces and tasted moral victory although
at a heavy price. Soon, however, Palestinians lost that feeling when the
different political groups opted to armed struggle. Gradually people lost
the initiative and became alienated when the Intifada was changed into
a dictated form of resistance. Such a state which was accompanied by a
harsh Israeli response of oppressive and humiliating tactics lead to failure
of the Intifada and yet another defeat. The tension which has energized
the original spirit of resistance was then turned inwardly in violent behavior
of Palestinians against fellow men.</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">For the second time people looked elsewhere
for leadership, vision and support. It was the PLO. But that organization
was already battered and suffering from disunity. The intervention of the
PLO into the Intifada through remote control from Tunis has seriously damaged
the Palestinian resistance. Its leadership was struggling to survive against
the forced exile and against starvation which was dangerously threatening
its existence following its stand besides Saddam of Iraq during the Gulf
war. The rise of the fundamentalist group of Hamas was already in place.
Hamas poses itself as the divine alternative to the crushed and desperate
Palestinians. Its appeal is powerful and significantly empowering. Hamas
continues to challenge the secular Palestinian groups and has stubbornly
refused to participate in any dealing with the current peace process. Although
they stand in the minority many Palestinians share their reservations and
objections.</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The declaration of principals and the
Cairo agreement were signed by two unequal parties. Israel has in effect
dictated the terms of the agreement on the Palestinians whose leadership
has entered the negotiations from a position of inner weakness edging on
total collapse and allowing submission. There is a growing constituency
among the Palestinians who feel that the peace accord has reduced the size
of Palestine even further and has devastated their dream of liberation
and reduced the PLO leadership into a ghetto life.</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Underneath such mood lies the feeling
of defeat in contrast to their feeling on the eve of the Arafat initiative,
a few months into their Intifada when they experienced the ecstasy of victory.
Indeed it was such feeling that prepared the much needed platform for Arafat's
initiative of peace. The feeling of loss is bewildering and overwhelming
that makes the peace road bending with potential hazards.</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The Palestinian position has reached
it's lowest ebb due to the undemocratic character of the PLO and the Palestinian
National Movement. It will only through democratic participation of people
that Palestinians can rebuild their community into a state and can contribute
to the stability of the area. As yet the signs are alarming with the domination
of one political faction and as the promised elections are repeatedly postponed.</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The Palestinians are a nation coming
out of the rubble. They have to address taboos and bring into the open
ideological, cultural and political weaknesses which have infiltrated their
national movement and seriously damaged their individual and collective
awareness. They have to address their dependency on the outside world,
their self-indulgent image of the victim, their own cycle of violence and
oppression, their conflict between religious and secular identity, and
the erosion of their national identity.</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Above all they have to confront the
loss of the dream of liberating all Palestine and the accompanying grief.
They will have to exercise democratic debate and respect the right to oppose.
Only then a new style of political and community leadership will evolve.
Effective professional management of their institutions should be installed.</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Palestinian growth as a people and a
nation was stunted due to the long history of foreign rule and particularly
because of the twenty seven years of Occupation. Paradoxical relation with
the alien rulers had developed into both dependency and defiance. The economic
infrastructure is devastated, health and educational services are rudimentary,
water resources are depletand the local security is almost none existent.
More serious are the effects on the human element. Palestinians under Occupation
have suppressed debate on all aspects of their cultural life and social
development as their energy was invested in combatting the occupation.
The call for freeing the land from the Israelis was the utmost priority.
In any case attempts to organize intellectual, political or popular movement
were crushed in their infancy by the Israelis.</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">At the communal level, the Palestinians
are still in the tribal stage of development where the clan is the main
source of security and form of identity. The of political organizations
in their modern history was authoritarian and oppressive discipline continue
to be the accepted concept within the family and the community, including
political institutions. Intellectual and cultural life is poor and women
continue to be oppressed.</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The peace process has further ignited
new divisions in the national scene with sharp polarization. Tension is
building high as people fear further escalation of violence against Israelis
and among Palestinians. Targeting Israelis by Hamas would undoubtedly expand
the already wide support for the Islamic movement, which has gained ground
in any event as tales of moral and financial corruption of the PLO are
rumored.</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Although I have no intention in going
into detailed examination of the Israeli state of mind, few observations
perhaps are worth considering. Israel has cultivated a culture that has
become entrenched in fear edging on paranoia, and for good reason. The
effects of that however are dangerous. Racism has taken roots in the Israeli
culture which meticulously suppressed guilt and favored dehumanization
of the enemy that has encompassed all Arabs. The victorious Sabra has turned
into an arrogant colonialist and oppressor. With the comfortable position
of the eternal victim, Israelis were projecting and spreading so much violence.
And for generations Israel was identifying itself with Europe and suppressing
all signs of identification with the Arab world from where half of its
citizens were drawn.</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Israel and Israelis would need to re-examine
their identity and to venture beyond Zionism and stretch into the wider
identity away from the confines of the ideology of the chosen people.</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The challenges of the new times are
already exposing the weaknesses of both cultures as the latest episode
of violence which shock the area has testified. There is so more courage
needed from the leadership which translates their vowed promises into reality.
Indeed, more is needed at the level of the intellectuals and the community
which can take us beyond mere words.</font>
