<p dir="LTR"><b><i><font color="#000066">Introduction:</font></i></b>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Five years into the Intifada, the conflicting
parties are beginning to negotiate a peaceful settlement. There can be
little doubt that the Intifada was the instrumental factor in bringing
this historical movement towards peace out of a seemingly perpetual conflict.
The Palestinians, who for decades refused to contemplate peace when it
always meant for them defeat</font>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">and surrender, are now ready to enter
into a dialogue with Israel as equals. The Israelis, who long denied the
existence of the Palestinians, are heavily burdened with the legacy of
the occupation and are ready for a compromise that would guarantee their
safety when they vacate the Palestinian land. Both parties are moving with
reluctance and timidity. Five decades of hatred and paranoia, five major
wars, thousands dead and deep scars of pain are not at all easy to bridge.</font>
<br><font color="#000066">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">But after peace prevails, when both
nations remember their heroes who sacrificed their lives, we must remember
the Palestinian children as the real peacemakers who stood at the forefront
of the Intifada. We will all indebted to these children whose sacrifices
fueled the dramatic upheaval and its hope for a bright future.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Many posters, postcards, articles
and books portray images of the children of the Intifada throwing stones.
In spite of all this attention, hardly anyone has given any insight on
the children's motives in assuming such a role. At the Gaza Community Mental
Health Programme (GCMHP), we decided to talk with the children themselves
and to observe them in action in the street and at home. In addition, many
families brought their children to the Programme for treatment of the effects
of trauma. Finally, we conducted studies in the field, employing psychological
surveys to understand more about their role, the extent of trauma and its
effects.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The Language of the Occupation:</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The words "angry" and "defiant" accurately
describe the Palestinian children. They are also tense and vigilant. For
many of them, throwing stones expresses that anger onto the Israeli soldiers
who are the legitimate target.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">These children have learned the language
and the meaning of the occupation. Even if every child has not been humiliated
by the Israeli soldiers or told that his or her life is worthless, the
environment sends this message loud and clear. Sami, a twelve year old
boy, was brought to the clinic by his</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">mother after he attempted suicide
by setting himself on fire.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">His legs were badly scarred, and he
looked hostile, angry and depressed. Sami said, "I wanted to kill myself
because my father did not bring me a new pair of trousers for the feast.
He said that he did not have any money. Why should he have children then
if he could not have a job?" His brother who was handicapped died a year
ago. His mother believes that Sami has changed since then. "My brother
Sameer died because he was cold. He was wet when we found him dead. It
was raining all night and it was dripping on him from the leaking roof.
He could not move himself because he was paralyzed."</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Children easily perceive the differences
between living conditions in their dirty camps and in the newly-built Israeli
settlements. These differences make them believe that Jewish children living
in the settlements deserve big, clean playgrounds and swimming pools while
their refugee camps have open sewer systems and garbage piled high at every
street corner. The buildings of the settlements are clean, the streets
are clean and the grass is watered even when there is a water shortage
in the camps. Palestinian children observe Israeli settlers zooming by
in their fast, well-protected cars that project an aura of power and security,
in contrast to their own feeling of vulnerability.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The language of the occupation sends
the message that life is not worth living and that children born in the
settlements are treasured while children born in the Palestinian camps,
villages, or towns are despised. This environment drives home the message
that the Palestinians are born to be the hewers of wood and drawers of
water both for the settlers and for the Israeli economy. The children witness
their fathers' and older brothers'</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">humiliation as they stand in line
at the "slave market" hoping to be offered one of the few jobs available
-- building yet another Israeli settlement.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Time and again the message is conveyed
to Palestinian children that they are dirty because they are unworthy and
that they are poor because their parents are weak and helpless. A Gaza
Community Mental Health Programme Survey has documented that 85% of the
children's houses have been raided by Israeli soldiers, mostly at night,
and 56% have witnessed the beating and humiliation of their fathers. Such
experiences leave their mark on children's perceptions of themselves and
the world around them. "If my father could not protect himself," a child
wonders, "how on earth is he going to protect me?"</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The inevitable reaction is a mixture
of fear, frustration, helplessness, anger, and -- perhaps most tragically
-- rejection of the father. Children sometimes find themselves identifying
with Israeli soldiers as symbols of power. At the very least, they are
driven out of their homes to look for heroes to replace their fathers,
who failed the test.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The Making of a Hero:</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The streets are the natural playgrounds
for the children of Gaza. They vibrate with a life beat that makes them
different from anywhere else: defiant, colorful, and dynamic. To be a child
in Gaza is to be enticed by its streets, incited by the graffiti on every
wall and irritated by the Israeli soldiers patrolling on foot or in their
jeeps through your own territory. A gathering crowd of activists preparing
for a confrontation with the soldiers fills the air with apprehension and
excitement. Now it is not a game any more. The toys are real jeeps and
the enemy are real soldiers. There he is, waiting just for you. This is
where you can avenge your father's humiliation. This is what you can do
to conquer your fear. This is where you will join the heroes, perhaps even
becoming one yourself.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Throwing stones becomes a way of rejecting
the definition of self which has been imposed by the occupier. It is a
process of externalizing the slave-consciousness that has been projected
by the child, into his or her innermost being.</font></div>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">In the psychological sense, throwing
stones is a form of recognizing and identifying the problem, a very crucial
step in the making of the Intifada child. Through this behavior children
decide both to assert themselves and to exercise their right to a free
and better life.</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">"I went home after school one day to
find a big crowd in my uncle's house. I was told that my seventeen year
old cousin was shot dead by the Israelis. Since then, I began to ask and
to understand more about the Intifada," says Marwan, a thirteen year old
boy from Gaza. "Now if they do not come, I go to look for them. We have
to fight them and free our country from these pigs. If I could only get
a gun, I would shoot them all."</font>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Throwing stones became essentially a
form of therapy not only for alestinian children but also for the entire
Palestinian nation. Years of helplessness and frustration gave way to active
resistance and defiance. The collective sense of injured pride and humiliation
was transformed overnight into a state of self- respect. Internal division,
recriminations, and communal</font>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">violence were replaced by solidarity,
unity and cohesion. All became one against a common enemy. Gloom and doom
disappeared and a state of excitement and euphoria prevailed.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">For a rare moment in the history of
the conflict, the Palestinians tasted victory when they effectively took
control of thlives by rebeling against the occupation. Indeed, the Palestinian
morale was such that it allowed them to enter the peace talks as equals.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Trauma:</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Victories, however, do not come cheap.
The Palestinians must still endure more pain. Ever since their eyes first
saw the first glimmer of hope, they have witnessed their country in turmoil
and spasm. Their collective memory is still alive with the dismemberment
of Palestine, their mass exodus into bitter and cold exile, the Suez War,
the October War, the invasion of</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Lebanon and life under military occupation.
Now it is the Intifada which promises salvation for the future but inflicts
pain now. The Palestinians wish to see the pain joined hand in hand with
the birth of a new life.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">But it is hard. For every act of rebellion
or defence, the Israelis react with even more oppression and harshness.
The children are particularly hard hit. From the shoot-to-kill policy and
the breaking bones policy to the night raids and beatings, the children
are forced to face the new challenge of a new time. They simply cannot
afford the luxury of childhood and have to assume the worries of the adulthood.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">As a child in a Gaza Camp, you must
worry about being chased, arrested, beaten or shot. You worry about your
older brother who was arrested a few weeks ago. You miss him and you worry
when your mother says that the Red Cross has no news of him. You also worry
about your father: could he get a permit to work and will he bring food
today? You feel deeply concerned for your friend who is in the hospital
with gunshot wounds. They say it was a</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">rubber bullet, but so much blood poured
from his head. You could not speak to him in the hospital because he was
in deep sleep.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The "children of the stone" are not
made of stone. They suffer pain and fear. The extent of their exposure
to traumatic events is horrific even at the statistical level. According
to a GCMHP survey of 2779 children, 92.5% were exposed to tear gas, 42%
were beaten, 55% have witnessed beating, 4.5% have had their bones broken
or other severe injured, 85% were exposed to night raids, and 19% were
detained for short periods of time.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Issa is seven year old boy from Bureij
refugee camp. His mother said that he had completely changed in the last
nine months. He complains of headaches, wets his bed at night and is aggressive
with his sisters. She said that Issa has difficulty sleeping and frequently
wakes up in the night shaking with terror. Issa was normal before the soldiers
burst into the house one night and beat his father and elder brother. Issa
says, "I am always afraid of the soldiers. They beat my friends at school
and my teachers many times. I run away when I see them coming. I want to
beat them, but they are very strong and they have guns. They kill."</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">When the battles are raging, the children
fight with their stones for their right to exist; they fight the ghoulish
monster of their dreams. When the battle is over, they gather to talk about
their joy of forcing the enemy to retreat or their grief over their mates
who fell.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Those who fell remain in the painful
corners of the hearts and minds of their fellow fighters. But death could
not be imagined, and had to be conquered. The dead became martyred, heroes
who are blessed and in heaven. Children know that there, life is full of
joy and no children are hurt.</font></div>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">At night, a child buries himself between
his parents, terrified of the monsters who might suddenly jump over the
wall hunting for their prey. In his dream, a monster pulls his gun to shoot;
the child tries to flee. He is shaken awake by his mother. He has wet the
bed again. The mother decides to take him to the clinic tomorrow. She made
this decision many times, but her son is never home during the day. The
mother is worried. Three of her</font>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">children wet their beds. "What on
earth is happening to them?"</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">she asks nobody. She cannot ask her
husband. He is too tired and moody after his release from the prison. He
must have been through so much. She is worried about him. "Maybe he should
see a doctor too?" she wonders.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The future:</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">What will become of you, the children
of the stone? What kind of students are you, and will you ever go to university?
What kind of parents will you be, warm and happy, or neurotic and abusive?
What teachers will we have, what lawyers, what leaders?</font></div>
<p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">It is difficult to imagine the future
of these children, even in peace, since they have never tasted peace themselves.
It is certain however that many will continue to harbour the pain, the
guilt, and the anger. It is also certain that some will turn against their
own children and against themselves. Some will also turn against the world,
the world which preached decency, justice and democracy, only to stand
by and watch the slaughter</font>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">of decency, justice, democracy and
the children. And if the children of the stone sacrificed themselves, will
this sacrifice bring peace and salvation after all?</font></div>
