PANEL CONFERENCE ON FORCED MIGRATION</font></b></center>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The International Association for
the Study of Forced Migration (IASFM) will convene the sixth International
Research and Advisory Panel Conference on Forced Migration (IRAP) in Gaza
from 13-16 December 1998. As was the case with the fifth IRAP in Eldoret,
Kenya, the conference is being hosted in a focal area of forced migration
during the Middle East Peace Talks. It will take place at Rashad El-Shawa
Cultural Center in Gaza, Palestine.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Since the first meeting in January
1990, IRAP has developed into the largest and most wide-ranging international
conference devoted solely to forced migration issues in the world. Held
every two years, the aim of the conference is to provide an interdisciplinary
forum for intellectual exchange and communication among academic researchers,
refugee professionals and policy makers, and to stimulate debate on research
priorities and policy issues. Discussion at the 6th IRAP conference will
concentrate on a number of key themes, on which offers of research or discussion
papers are urgently sought:</font></div>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000066">Current issues in forced migration: changes in the
right to asylum and the right to remain.</font></li>
<li>
<font color="#000066">Host responses: opportunities for participation and
integration.</font></li>
<li>
<font color="#000066">Repatriation, reconstruction and social reconciliation.</font></li>
</ul>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Within each theme, regional case studies
from Palestine or other focal areas of the worldwide problem of forced
migration are sought. Also aspects like gender, age (i.e. unaccompanied
minors), ethnicity and sexual preference should be presented and integrated
into the discussions. After an opening session on 13 December, in which
two international experts (one researcher, and one policy-maker) discuss
the international developments regarding the right to asylum and the discussion
on a right to remain, each of the following three days will be wholly or
partly devoted to one of the themes listed above. In each case, plenary
sessions to be addressed by invited keynote speakers will be followed by
parallel workshops providing a forum for discussion of submitted papers,
or allowing for round-table discussion on particular issues or regions.
In addition to these formal sessions there will be a series of specialist
workshops on issues such as regional activities, teaching, public policy,
etc., at the initiative of conference participants. A range of optional
excursions will also be available at the end of the conference.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">A meeting of the assembly of IASFM
members will take place discussing the reports from the board, the IASFM
policy plan, future activities and rules of the association. At this meeting,
members will elect the officers for the next term.</font></div>
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The host of the 6th IRAP, the Gaza
Community Mental Health Programme, is a Palestinian non-governmental institution,
established in 1990. GCMHP aims to offer comprehensive community-based
mental health services. Research and training constitute an important part
of GCMHP. Numerous research projects have been completed and many are still
being carried out. The GCMHP hosted several international conferences such
as the Third International Conference on "Health and Human Rights" in October
1997. For details, please visit http://www.gcmhp.net.</font></div>
