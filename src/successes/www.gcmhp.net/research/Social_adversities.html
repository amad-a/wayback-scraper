<p dir="LTR">Aim - To investigate the rate and nature of childhood anxiety
symptoms and disorders, and their relationship to social adversities in
a cultural sample not previously researched. Methods - A sample of 237
children of 9-13 years living in the Gaza strip was randomly selected in
a school-based study. Children completed the Revised Manifest Anxiety Scale
and teachers completed the Rutter Scale. Results - Children reported high
rates of significant anxiety problems (21.5%) and teachers reported even
higher rates of mental health problems (43.4%) that would justify a clinical
assessment. Anxiety problems, particularly negative cognitions, increased
with age and were significantly higher among females. Low socio-economic
status was the strongest predictor of general mental health problems. Living
in inner-city areas or camps, both common among refugees, was strongly
associated with anxiety problems.
<p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">Conclusions</font> - </b>The rate
and nature of anxiety disorders were similar to those established in western
societies. Factors reflecting social adversity and lack of stability were
also similarly involved. There may be more similarities in the presentation
of mental health symptoms across cultures than previously believed, due
to lack of cross-cultural research.

<p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">Introduction</font></b>
<p dir="LTR">Social disadvantage is well established as a risk factor for
the development and prognosis of child psychiatric disorders<sup>1</sup>.
Factors such as family size and overcrowding (at least four children),
low social class, family disruption and breakdown, father’s employment
(semi- or unskilled job), father’s criminality, and school disadvantage
have predominantly been associated with conduct disorders<sup>2-4</sup>.
Most research has found increased prevalence of conduct disorders in inner-city
deprived areas<sup>5</sup>. The identified socioeconomic risk factors are
associated with poor child mental health outcome<sup>6-7</sup>.
<p dir="LTR">The association of anxiety (emotional) disorders with social
adversity is less clear<sup>7</sup>. Epidemiological studies from the UK
and North America have found prevalence rates between 6-9% for severe conditions,
including separation anxiety disorders<sup>8-9</sup>, and about 20% for
anxiety symptom constellations<sup>5</sup> in the general population. In
contrast with conduct disorders, there is some effect of socioeconomic
status on the development of anxiety disorders, but this does not appear
to be as strongly predictive as parental illness and life events<sup>10</sup>.
<p dir="LTR">So far, research findings are predominantly from western society
populations<sup>11</sup>. It is as yet unclear whether social adversity
factors are similarly involved in the mechanisms underlying child psychopathology
in cultures with different family and social structure. The aim of the
study to investigate the relationship between social disadvantage and anxiety
disorders among Palestinian children living in the Gaza Strip.
<p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">Methods</font></b>
<p dir="LTR">The study was performed in the Gaza strip, which had a population
of 860,369 in 1995, excluding returnees from abroad after the peace process.
The Gaza Strip has a high population density of 2,150 people per km<sup>2</sup>,
which is a psychosocial risk factor for child psychopathology. The total
refugee population is 62.6%. About 55.1% live in eight crowded camps, and
44.9% live in villages and towns. Half of the population (50.8%) are younger
than 15 years of age. In 1995, the annual infant birth rate was 49.4 per
1000 population, the infant mortality rate was between 26-50 per 1000 infants,
and the general population death rate was 8 per 1000. Respiratory diseases
and diarrhoea are major causes of infant morbidity and mortality. The annual
increase of population growth in the Gaza Strip is 4.5%.
<p dir="LTR">The sample of this study was selected at random from children
of 9-13 years of age, attending twelve state schools in the five districts
of the Gaza strip. Twenty children were randomly selected from each school.
As this was a school-based survey, ethics approval was granted by the Ministry
of Education and parents gave informed consent before children were approached.
For each child the following scales were administered:
<p dir="LTR"><i>Rutter teacher scale<sup>12-13</sup>: </i>This is a widely
used and standardised screening questionnaire for the detection of child
mental health problems in different cultures. It consists of twenty-six
items of child mental health problems, rated on a 0-2 scale (statements
'certainly applies', 'applies somewhat' or 'doesn't apply'). There are
three subscales measuring conduct, emotional and hyperactivity problems.
A total score of 9 or above has been found to predict the presence of mental
health disorder. The Rutter scales have been translated and piloted in
Arabic.
<p dir="LTR"><i>Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale(RCMAS<sup>13</sup>):</i>
The RCMAS is a standardised 37-item self-report questionnaire for children
of 6-19 years of age. It measures the presence or absence of anxiety-related
symptoms (yes/no answers) in 28 anxiety items and 9 lie items. Factor analysis
of the anxiety items has identified three factors: physiological, worry/oversensitivity
and concentration<sup>14</sup>. A cut-off total score of 18 has been found
to predict the presence of anxiety disorder<sup>15</sup>. This instrument
was also translated into Arabic and was completed in the presence of a
researcher, who clarified the items if necessary. Demographic data were
collected on family structure and family size, area of residence, housing
status/overcrowding, and parents= employment status.
<p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">Results</font></b>
<p dir="LTR">Demographic data are presented in Table 1. Twenty children
were selected from each of the twelve schools, or 240 children, 237 of
whom agreed to take part (98.7%). Their mean age was 10.8 years. The great
majority (N=228, or 96.2%) lived with both parents, and had at least three
siblings (N=217, or 91.6%). Only one child had lived in care, and only
twelve mothers were in employment.

<div dir="LTR">The most frequently teacher-rated abnormal behaviours (i.e.
rated as &gt;certainly applying=) were, bullying (11%), lying (10.5%), disobedience
(10.5%), and fighting (6%). The most frequent emotional items were, worries
(17.3%), fears (11.8%), and feeling miserable (5.9%). The most frequent
hyperactivity items were, restlessness (16.0%), poor concentration (12.2%),
and being squirmy (11.4%). Significant school absence related to anxiety
was reported in 21 children (8.9%), and truancy related to behaviour problems
in 6 children (2.5%). A high number of children (N=104, or 43.4%) exceeded
the cut-off point of 9, which indicates the potential presence of significant
mental health problems. Males had higher scores on the hyperactivity subscale
than females (Mann-Whitney U test: z=2.07, p=0.04). Low socioeconomic status
(i.e. the father being unemployed or unskilled worker) was the sociodemographic
variable that best predicted the presence of mental health problems in
children (caseness, i.e. Rutter scales score of 9 or above) in a forward
stepwise logistic regression (B=0.38, SE=0.13, p=0.004). This variable
also best predicted the total conduct subscale score (linear regression:
B=1.01, 95%CI 0.34-1.68, p=0.003). The total teacher-rated emotional subscale
score was best predicted by the age of the child (i.e. increased with age:
B=0.67, 95%CI 0.02-1.32, p=0.04).</div>
<div dir="LTR">The detailed self-reported anxiety items (Revised Children=s
Manifest Anxiety Scale) are presented in Table 2. Fifty-one children (21.5%)
scored above the cut-off score for anxiety disorders. Females reported
significantly higher total anxiety scores (mean scores 8.2 and 6.5 respectively;
Mann-Whitney U test: z=2.44, p=0.015) and were significantly more likely
to have scores above the cut-off (x<sup>2</sup>=3.9, DF=1, p=0.047). Also,
females scosignificantly higher than males on most anxiety items, particularly:
&gt;having trouble making up my mind= (Mann-Whitney U test: z=2.9, p=0.003),
&gt;getting nervous when things do not go the right way= (z=2.2, p=0.03),
&gt;others do things easier than me= (z=2.2, p=0.03), &gt;worrying about what
parents will say= (z=2.1, p=0.03), &gt;feeling that others do not like the

concentration= (z=2.0, p=0.04), and &gt;often worrying about something bad
happening= (z=3.3, p=0.001).</div>

<div dir="LTR">Children with possible anxiety disorders were more likely
to be living in an inner-city area or camps (x<sup>2</sup>=9.2, DF=2, p=0.01).
Older age (B=0.33, SE=0.12, p=0.01) and living in inner city or camps (B=0.59,
SE=0.3, p=0.05) were the strongest predictors of anxiety disorders in a
logistic regression. Teacher-rated conduct and hyperactivity scores were
strongly correlated (r=0.76, p&lt;0.0005).</div>
<div dir="LTR">In order to investigate the potential change of anxiety
symptoms with age, we compared the youngest (N=62 nine-year-olds) with
the oldest (N=26 thirteen-year-olds) group of the sample on all anxiety
items (Mann-Whitney U test). Older children scored significantly higher
on 7 anxiety symptoms, mainly related to cognitions.</div>
<div dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">Discussion</font></b></div>
<p dir="LTR">This study on the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and disorders
among children living in the Gaza strip found a similar pattern with previous
epidemiological research from western societies. There were high rates
of anxiety disorders and school-related mental health problems. In a previous
community survey in the United States using the RCMAS, Kashani and Orvaschel<sup>16</sup>
found the same prevalence rate (21%) of anxiety disorders, which included
separation anxiety, phobic and overanxious disorders. This study also identified
similar frequencies of symptoms, such as worries and nightmares, to the
American study.
<p dir="LTR">Anxiety problems significantly increased with age, particularly
among females. Although &gt;physiological= symptoms of anxiety were highly
reported (insomnia, nightmares, sweating), children also experienced a
substantial amount of negative cognitions related to poor self-image and
self-esteem. Social cognitions, such as self-awareness, shame and guilt,
first develop in middle childhood (7-8 years). Between 9-12 years, children
can distinguish between conflicting emotions, and between others= accidental
and intentional behaviours. Internal psychological factors are increasingly
perceived as causal to the child=s behaviour. During adolescence, social
cognitions are enhanced further, together with the development of belief
systems, hypothetical and abstract thinking, and self-evaluation of their
thought process. This explains the increase of anxiety-related cognitions
with age, which is consistent with previous findings<sup>16</sup>, and
has implications for treatment interventions, particularly cognitive-behavioural
therapy<sup>17</sup>.
<p dir="LTR">The findings did not support the commonly held belief that
anxiety and other mental health symptoms are predominantly expressed through
somatising symptoms in non-western cultures and societies. This view may
be due to lack of systematic epidemiological research on cross-cultural
issues. Studies on phenomenology indicate that child mental health symptoms
do not differ significantly across cultures and that culture-specific mental
health disorders are rare<sup>18</sup>.
<p dir="LTR">Social adversity factors were implicated in the development
of anxiety and other mental health problems, even within a society with
extended family and community networks. As in earlier UK-based research<sup>3-4</sup>,
factors involved were lower socioeconomic status (reflected by the father=s
employment status) and living in inner-city areas. A mediating factor involved
could be the social instability of refugee families within this population,
who lived in urban areas and camps. In contrast, the social support system
of families from rural areas has not been disrupted despite the war, and
this may have acted as a protective factor for the children. In a study
among Croatian children during the war, Zivcic<sup>19</sup> found significantly
higher depressive and phobic symptoms in displaced (refugee) than in local
children in stable social conditions. In contrast with studies from western
countries, large family size (overcrowding) was not found to be associated
with child mental health problem. In Arabic families, a large number of
children is culturally determined rather than an index of adversity or
deprivation.
<p dir="LTR">The experience of traumas by children in war zones is often
directly related to the development of anxiety symptoms such as fear and
nightmares. In a prevalence study of post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD)
reactions from another young population living in the same area, the authors
found PTSD reactions of at least mild severity in 73% of children of 6-11
years, while 39% of the children reported moderate to severe PTSD reactions
(Thabet &amp; Vostanis, submitted for publication). Other studies with
children of war have found similar associations between trauma and psychopathology.
Ahmad<sup>20</sup> established PTSD in about 25% of displaced Kurdish children,
and Weine et al<sup>21</sup> found similar rates in Bosnian adolescents
who had moved to America during the war. Nader et al<sup>22</sup> established
moderate to severe posttraumatic stress reactions in 70% of Kwaiti children
following the Gulf war.
<p dir="LTR">Limitations of the study need to be acknowledged, particularly
the lack of diagnostic interview and corroborative information from the
parents. Research instruments used in cross-cultural research need further
development, as little is known on potential cultural influences on how
children interpret certain questions<sup>23</sup>. Future research also
needs to address the potential impact of family and social beliefs and
perceptions of child mental health problems. Child mental health services
in developing countries are often best integrated with existing primary
child health care services<sup>18</sup>. Treatment intervention programmes
need to be developed and evaluated for traumatised children.
