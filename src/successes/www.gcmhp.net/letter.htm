<p><b><font color="#000066">Your Excellency, President Arafat</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">October 15, 1997</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Dear President Arafat,</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">We, the participants of the Third International
Conference on Health and Human Rights organised by the Gaza Community Mental
Health Programme, were pleased that you were able to open the conference
through your representative, Mr. Suliman Shorafa. This conforms with your
earlier commitments to human rights as stated in the Declaration of Independence
of the State of Palestine and your reaffirmation of this at your meeting
with Amnesty International in July 1994, following your arrival in Palestine.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">We believe that the Palestinian commitment
to human rights was, during the years of your exile, a powerful weapon
that assisted in demonstrating the wrongfulness of the Israeli occupation
and in securing your arrival and that of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">The Third Conference has clearly shown the
intimate and profound link that exists between health and human rights,
and the adverse consequences to health of human rights violations. Assured
by this evidence we wish to respectfully request from you the following:</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">1.To reaffirm your commitment to human rights
and at the earliest possible opportunity introduce into law measures that
protect and promote democracy and human rights.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">2. To resist all pressure to violate or diminish
the rule of law and the rights of the Palestinian people.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">3. To release all prisoners detained for their
political, religious or other beliefs, or speedily bring them to fair trial.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">4. To acknowledge the essential role that non-governmental
organisations play in a democratic civil society and the importance of
ensuring respect for their role in Palestine.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">Signed by the participants</font></b>

<p><font color="#000066">Mr. Benyamin Netanyahu</font>
<p><font color="#000066">Office of the Prime Minister</font>
<p><font color="#000066">3 Kaplan Street, Jerusalem 91919</font>
<p><font color="#000066">Israel, fax 972 2 566 4838</font>
<p><font color="#000066">October 15, 1997</font>
<p><font color="#000066">Dear Prime Minister,</font>
<p><font color="#000066">The Gaza Community Mental Health Programme is
currently holding its Third International Conference. The theme of this
year's conference, Health and Human Rights, has attracted over 400 health
professionals, scholars, and social activists. Unfortunately, a number
of invited guests were unable to attend the conference because of intransigence
on the part of Israeli officials. You could send no stronger signal of
your sentiments toward the human rights of the Palestinian people than
to block simple travel plans from one area to another for people dedicated
to the promotion of human rights and improved health conditions around
the world.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">During our conference, participants have amply
demonstrated the close relationship that exists between health and human
rights. Having made this link we feel obliged to raise a number of concerns
about ongoing human rights abuses perpetrated by your government. We respectfully
submit to you the following requests.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">1. All cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment
and torture of prisoners must cease in accordance with Article V of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">2. All political prisoners must be released immediately.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">3. The severe closure policy begun on March 30,
1993 must cease as it damages the Palestinian economy and frequently endangers
the lives of Palestinian patients in need of medical attention.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">4. House demolitions and the ongoing expropriation
of Palestinian land in the Gaza Strip West Bank and East Jerusalem are
grave human rights violations and must cease immediately.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">5. The existence of the Israeli settlements is
a serious violation of human rights and international law. All settlement
building and expansion must cease immediately.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">6. Meaningful negotiations must begin at once.
Further delay only risks plunging the region back into war and bloodshed.
Such a result would be the gravest violation of human rights of all.</font>
<p><font color="#000066">Sincerely,</font>
<p><font color="#000066">GCMHP and conference participants</font>
