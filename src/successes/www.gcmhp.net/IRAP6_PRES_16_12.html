The Sixth International Research and Advisory Panel (IRAP) Conference on
Forced Migration ended today in Jerusalem.
<p>The final plenary speaker this morning was Dr. Lex Takkenberg, Deputy
Director of UNRWA.&nbsp; Dr. Takkenberg presented the results of his doctoral
thesis on Palestinian refugees in international law, which has recently
been published by Oxford University Press.&nbsp; He pointed out that Palestinians
are the only group of refugees that fall outside the international system.&nbsp;
UNHCR and UNRWA were created by the United Nations in the same week in
1949, and it was deliberately decided to exclude Palestinian refugees from
the mandate of UNHCR, the agency charged with protecting the world's refugees.&nbsp;
Instead, UNRWA was created to assist them.&nbsp; A problem with the arrangements,
Dr. Takkenberg, stated, is that UNRWA does not have the protection mandate
that UNHCR has, and it is also not tasked with finding a "durable solution"
to the Palestinian refugee problem.&nbsp; This has resulted in a lack of
adequate protection for Palestinian refugees, although UNRWA has undertaken
certain actions to protect refugees, for example by positioning international
monitors at crisis points in the West Bank.
<p>In an afternoon workshop, Dr. Jad Isaac of the Applied Research Institute
- Jerusalem made an extremely convincing presentation on the geography
of the Israeli occupation of Palestine.&nbsp; He showed how Israeli road
building is strangling Palestinian towns in the West Bank, and presented
date on the number of Palestinian homes that have been demolished without
compensation to build those roads.&nbsp; He demonstrated how control of
water resources is the crucial variable in the political equation of peace.&nbsp;
Shared water resources are not shared equitably as Israeli settlers in
Palestine use several times more water than the Palestinians.&nbsp; This
unequal distribution of water has allowed Israeli settlers to develop irrigated
agriculture, while Palestinian lands turn to (or remain) desert.
<p>There was also a workshop on Palestinians in Palestine, which included
presentations by Mohammed Almbaid on "Reverse Migration as a Development
Strategy: The Case of Palestine"; Abdel Aziz Thabet and Panos Vostanis
on "Social Adversities and Anxiety Disorders in the Gaza Strip"; Christopher
Parker on "Constituent Transition, Mobilization, and Conflict in the Palestinian
Diaspora: A Conceptual Approach and Tentative Applications"; and by Mustafa
Mari on "Peace Processes, Refugee Rights, and Population Transfer: A Comparative
Analysis of the Peace Processes in Northern Ireland, Palestine, and South
Africa".
<p>Other workshops today were on the topics of:
<br>1- Repatriation and Reconciliation: Decisions at the local and individual
level
<br>2- Decisions on Repatriation by Host Countries and Refugees
<br>3- Perspectives on Mental Health Care of Refugees after Repatriation
<br>4- Reconciliation and Repatriation in Latin American Countries
<p>At the end of the day, there was a closing session that was chaired
by the newly elected President of the International Association for the
Study of Forced Migration, Loes van Willigen.&nbsp; There was a report
and analysis by Karin Geuijen about the conference as a whole and future
vision for the IASFM. Dr. Art Hansen, ex-president of the IASFM were he
expressed his hope that the participants would return to their various
jobs and functions with new ideas and visions about working with the issue
of Forced Migration.&nbsp; Abdel Hamid Afana from the Gaza Community mental
Health Program made a speech on behalf of Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj, thanked the
organization for choosing to hold their conference in Palestine, and said
that the conference was a great opportunity for the exchange of knowledge
about the Palestinian refugee issues.&nbsp; He hoped that the mutual work
and networking would come as a result of this conference.&nbsp; Loes van
Willigen made the last speech of the conference where she wished that new
ideas and recommendations for the next IRAP conference would come from
the participants.&nbsp; Dr. van Willigen thanked GCMHP for their hospitality
and for their organizing the conference although it was very complicated
to move the conference to Jerusalem from Gaza.&nbsp; She thanked the local
organizing committee and a present was forwarded and signed from all the
participants.
