<p><b>In recent years more and more sophisticated psychological and physical
methods of torture are being developed by the torturers world-wide in order
to avoid visible body marks.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Physical torture produces well-defined acute symptoms and signs but
these resolve spontaneously or after therapy. After few weeks there may
not be enough visible physical signs to establish evidence.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Some types of torture, especially those high in intensity, leave
chronic and well-defined late physical sequelae.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Contrary to the physical effects of torture, the psychological symptoms
are persistent and can last months, years or a lifetime if left untreated.</b><b></b>
<p><b>In the largest world wide investigation to date of 526 torture survivors
one found the diagnoses of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression
and anxiety to be significantly more common in the tortured group compared
to non-tortured refugees of same nationality (Shresta et. Al., 1998).</b><b></b>
<p><b>PTSD and personality change after extreme life experience are defined
as direct consequences to torture in the ICD-10 classification of mental
and behavioural disorders (F62 Enduring personality changes, not attributable
to brain damaged and disease). The ICD-10 is the standard diagnostic system
of the World Health Organisation, that is obligatory in all evidence-based
medical science.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Scientific studies over the last decade have proven the direct and
casual link with these clearly defined disorders and neurophysiological
basis in survivors of torture and similar forms of extreme violence.</b><b></b>
<p><b>In connection with tortured individuals it is much more important
to underline that the threatening of the organism leads to the activation
of multiple neuro-biological systems.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Anxiety, depression, insomnia, nightmares, memory difficulties, social
withdrawal, irritability, feelings of helplessness, affective numbing,
flashbacks, shame, mistrust, ruminations, unexplained pain, the conviction
of being permanently injured and changed, many medical complaints, loss
of appetite, and loss of sexual desire are some of the most common symptoms
and feelings after physical and psychological torture.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Especially the feeling of being a changed person corresponds to the
aim of the torturers to destory the victim as a human being through a systematic
infliction of severe pain and extreme psychological humiliation.</b><b></b>
<p><b>All of these traumatic reactions are in reality psychosomatic reactions
since all psychological symptoms in the human organism have a physiological
basis.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The latest neuro-biological and stress research shows that such an
extreme stressor as torture alters the central nervous system and the physiological
system in general which can explain the symptom of hyper-arousal in torture
victims (anxiety, insomnia, rage, irritability, shame, and fear).</b><b></b>
<p><b>Thus, the lasting psychological symptoms are body/mind expressions
caused by the violent attacks on the body and the death threat connected
with these attacks. Furthermore the violations of body and mind put the
individual in a situation where he can neither flee nor fight back, the
normal, innate responses to danger and humiliation.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Inability to either fight back or flee before, during and after torture
or when re-experiencing the traumatic memories of torture, leaves the individual
with enormous physiological arousal.</b><b></b>
<p><b>We must emphasise that in torture one cannot separate the psychological
symptoms from the attacks on body and mind-even when the visible scars
or signs have disappeared.</b>
