<h1><center><em>WATER SOURCES</em>
</center></h1>
<bold>Introduction:
</bold>
 Jerusalem Water Undertaking has to purchase more than 60% of its current drinking water supply from the Israeli Authorities. Even with these quantities,  there was a real water shortage in the JWU distribution area during the last years which caused JWU to ration water supplies to the different areas. JWU sees a diehard reason for increasing the water sources in the area to accommodate the increasing demand for water especially since there will be an expected population increase because of the peace effort in the area. Hydrologists and Hydrogeological engineers pointed out certain sites in which drilling for water should commence. One of these sites is the Ein Samia  well field which is located in the Eastern Groundwater Basin. After drilling Well No. 6 in this area, it is believed that any further drilling in this vicinity will not be productive.

</p><center><i>Ein Samia Well Field (Ein Samia Plains)</i></center>
<p>
The Western Groundwater Basin of the West Bank is considered as
one unit called the Nahr El-Auja-Tamaseeh Basin. Water is discharged
seaward beneath the coastal plain. The annual renewable recharge
of this basin is between 335-380 MCM. A small portion of the rainwater
that seeps through the exposed parts of the Cenomanian and Turonian
aquifers in the Western Groundwater Basin flows in springs draining
the sloping aquifers - but most of the water reaches the regional
aquifer and it is tapped by wells on both sides of the 1948 Armistice
Line between the Palestinian Territory's West Bank and Israel
- with the greater usage being now on the Israeli side.
</p><p>
From Israel's own reporting, it is stated that the high usage
by the Israelis of the Western Groundwater Basin is causing the
water level in this Western Basin to drop 0.79-1.03 meters/year.
To keep the majority of the water of this aquifer for themselves,
the Israeli government, who of course also controls the lands
in the West Bank through its military forces and military laws,
prevents Palestinian farmers (especially in the western half of
the West Bank) from drilling new wells for agriculture and restrict
rehabilitation and maintenance of their old wells.
</p><p>
Although most of the groundwater of the West Bank's Western Basin
area is actually under the western part of the West Bank, these
water resources are used in the water supply of Israel as mentioned
above. The amount of water provided by this western basin of the
West Bank supplies about 25% of Israel's total water supply through
either natural discharge or by wells pumping within Israel. The
overuse and misuse of this water basin by the Israelis is one
of the most sensitive issues between Palestinians and Israelis.
</p><p>
The service area of the Jerusalem Water Undertaking (JWU) is partially
located on this Palestinian Western Groundwater Basin. Despite
the need for water in the area, the Israeli government did not
allow during the 28 years of occupation any water resource development
for JWU in this western part of the watershed.
</p><p>
Prior to the 1967 Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the Jordanian
government did however drill five exploratory wells in the Western
Basin in 1964 in order to test and monitor the availability of
water in the area for the JWU. In fact, a pumping test was done
on exploratory well No. 2 in the Shibteen area on May 6, 1967,
only one month before the occupation. Since 1967, three of these
exploratory wells have been capped and two are being pumped by
the Israelis and these two wells serve about 22 villages and 6
Israeli settlements under the jurisdiction of the West Bank Water
Department of the Israeli military government's civil administration
and do not contribute in any way to the water distribution network
under the jurisdiction of JWU.
</p><p>
JWU was supposed to utilize the Shibteen well field for the future
demand of the central part of Palestine since it is obvious that
the only water source left for fulfilling the demand is the Western
Basin.
</p><p>
During the peace talks, the Palestinian negotiators insisted on
their surface and groundwater rights in the West Bank, especially
in the Western Basin.

It is important to mention here that at the present time, the
Palestinian National Authority negotiators are busily and actively
trying to regain control over the Palestinian water resources
and to eliminate the dependency on the purchased water from the
Israelis.

PLANS FOR WATER SOURCES DEVELOPMENT</b>
</p><p>
The following are the ongoing activities and future plans to overcome
the water shortages in JWU's area of supply and to bring to an
end the Undertaking's dependency on purchased water:
</p><p>
1. Well No. 2a at Ein Samia.<br>
<b>To replace the old irrigation well with new<br>
higher yield Well:</b> The drilling, civil works, electrical works,
pumping equipment and performance tests are completed. The Well
will be fully operational by December 1, 1995. Funding is from
the German Government through GTZ
</p><p>
2. Well No. 3 at Ein Samia.<br>
<b>To increase the capacity of the well:</b> Procurement of higher
yield pump is in progress. The well will be fully operational
by December 1, 1995. Funding is from the German Government through
GTZ
</p><p>

<p>
</p><center><i>Equipping Well #2a Ein Samia, 1995</i></center>
<p>
3. Well No. 6 at Ein Samia<br>
<b>To drill a new well:</b> In the planning stages. Studies completed,potential funding from the German Government through GTZ.
</p><p>
4. Develop a remote control and monitoring system to control the
wells, pumping stations, and Reservoirs from JWU head office.
</p><p>
5. Prepare, design and conduct plans and studies for locating
new wells.
