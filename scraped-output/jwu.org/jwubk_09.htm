<center><h2><em>UNACCOUNTED FOR WATER (UAFW)</em>
</h2></center>
In the last 18 years, UAFW was gradually reduced from a peak level of 33% to its present level of 25%. While the Undertaking understands that this level is higher than internationally accepted ratios, it is much lower than other water authorities in the area. Recognizing the loss problem, JWU has embarked on an ambitious plan to replace the obsolete water network with the aim of reducing the present ratio to about 15% of the total water supply.  
<p>
<b><a name="_Toc342547240">CAUSES OF UFW</a></b>
</p><p>
Many factors determine the quantity and percentage of UFW. These
differ from one network to another or even in the same network.
The following tables show the water losses over the years 1991-1994
and illustrate the reasons, percentages and the cost of UFW at
JWU as recorded in 1994:

IN MAIN SUPPLY LINES</b>
</p><p>
These losses may be defined as the quantities of water lost in
the main lines between water sources and the distribution network.
These losses are caused by leaks or damages to the lines due to
excessive water pressure, damage by external factors or corrosion.
The percentage of this kind of loss is small because JWU started
to replace old deteriorated lines with new 6", 10",
and 16" diameter pipes. These pipes are installed below the
ground surface at depths between 80 - 125 cm according to engineering
specifications. Pressure is monitored in most of these lines through
electronic control systems that signal the pumps when the pressure
is nearing a dangerous level thus preventing the pipes from bursting.

</p><p>
<b>LOSSES IN THE NETWORK</b>
</p><p>
These losses constitute the quantity of water lost between the
main supply lines and the consumers meters. These losses constitute
the highest percentage of water losses and can be credited to
the deterioration and aging of the pipelines which do not conform
to standards and have been laid either exposed or more than two
meters below ground surface. Water losses in the network can be
detected and traced by many methods, some of which are the following:
</p><ul>
<li>Direct observation by the public or by JWU employees
</li><li>Assumption that old pipelines are either damaged or deteriorated.
</li><li>Inspection of consumer's water meters
</li><li>Installing main water meters at the entrance of each locality
and comparing the readings with the total of all consumer meters
of that locality. The difference in the readings can be considered
as water losses and can be dealt with on a priority basis.
</li><li>Performing a general survey using electronic leak detection
in suspected localities.
</li></ul>

</p><p>
<b>LOSSES IN METERS</b>
</p><p>
Water losses in meters can be defined as the quantity of water
that is consumed by consumers but not recorded by the meters.
The reasons for these losses may be credited to the following:
</p><ul>
<li>The accuracy of the 1/2" meters in use is + or - 2% at
a flow rate of 22.7 liter per hour when installed. However, with
passage of time, the meter may stop recording due to failure in
its internal gears.
</li><li>Water supplied to consumers is usually stored in small tanks
built on their roofs. These tanks lower the water flow through
meters and since the 1/2" meter does not record any flow
less than 3.4 l/h, a large quantity of water is not recorded and
is thus recorded as losses.
</li><li>Meter accuracy is reduced due to scale deposits on the internal
gears or to dirt.
</li></ul>

</p><p>
<b>BLACK LOSSES</b>
</p><p>
The illegal consumption of water has increased in the last few
years due to lack of law enforcement and to the hard economical
and social circumstances in the area. JWU is combating this trend
by raising the awareness of the consumers and by increasing inspection
and imposing penalties on the violators.
</p><p>

</p><p>
<b>WATER LOSSES DETECTION</b>
</p><p>
A simple method is used by JWU to detect the exact quantity of
water losses in private meters. Main standard meters were installed
on different main lines supplying certain sectors of consumers.
By comparing the consumption recorded by private meters with that
on the main meter, it appeared that the recorded quantities of
water flowing through private meters were on the average 11.3%
less than the quantities of water flowing through the main standard
meters. This difference shows the actual water losses which private
meters fail to record.

<b><a name="_Toc342472897"></a><a name="_Toc342473493"></a><a name="_Toc342547246"></a>FUTURE
PLANS IN THE METER SECTION</b>
</p><p>
<b>Customer Relations Unit</b>
</p><p>
This is perhaps one of the most important developments required
in the organizational structure of JWU. Constant interruptions
by subscribers with complaints and other requests plague many
employees. In addition, conflicting answers to the subscribers
questions do not give a good image of JWU's organization. The
Customer Relations Unit should deal directly with all customer
complaints and requests and follow the necessary procedures to
execute the requests and answer their questions without requiring
the customer to speak with any other individual at JWU except
in extreme cases.
</p><p>
<b>Monitoring of Consumer Consumption for Irregularities </b>
</p><p>
Since consumer consumption is already entered into the computer
for billing purposes, this information should be used to monitor
consumption and automatically report on irregularities. Limits
should be set as 'normal' consumption (say, plus or minus 20%
of the average consumption of the specific consumer) and allowances
made for seasonal changes (an increase in the expected consumption
in summer). Any consumption outside these limits should be checked.
The responsibility for this activity should be assigned to the
Customer Services Division (Meters).
</p><p>
<b>Incentives for Collectors</b>
</p><p>
In order to decrease the number of unpaid bills and control the
time the meter bill collectors spend in the field, incentives
on bill collecting should be implemented. Bill collectors should
be given a bonus based on number of bills and amounts collected.
</p><p>
<b>Installation of Main Water Meters</b>
</p><p>
The Undertaking prepared a project to install main water meters
at the entrances of villages and distribution localities in order
to compare the reading from these meters with the collective reading
of all the meters in each village or locality. This action, will
determine the amount of water losses and possibly its location.
</p><p>
<b>Installation of Water Meter Test Bench</b>
</p><p>
The Undertaking recognizes the need for improving the efficiency
of its water meters, hence it introduced a project to purchase
a new improved water meter test bench. This test bench has the
capability to test 50 meters at one time which will make it feasible
and possible for the Undertaking to test a much larger number
of consumer meters in order to maintain the efficiency and accuracy
of these meters.
</p><p>
<b>Data Terminals for Meter Readers and Collectors</b>
</p><p>
This will increase the number of meters read daily ( currently
85 meters per reader per day) by 70%-100% . Additionally, the
readings gathered by the readers will be entered into the computer
system automatically.
