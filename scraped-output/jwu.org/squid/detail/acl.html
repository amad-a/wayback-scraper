Access control lists are the part of Squid's configuration that cause most
people problems. Some things are not necessarily immediately obvious,
but they allow you to be very specific as to what to deny in a short form.
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica">
<font size="+1"><b>Basics</b></font>
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica">
Stopping or allowing people from using you as a proxy server is only one of
the functions of ACLs. ACLs are also used for cache hierarchies.
Thus you will define an ACL first, and then deny or allow access to a function
of the cache. In 99% of cases this feature will be "http_access", which allows
or denies a web browser's to access you. We will use this as an example for
all further cases, though principles apply to the other options (such as
"icp_access").
</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica">
Squid works it's way through the http_access list from top to bottom when
deciding which class you fall into, and also as to if you are denied or
allowed access.  Thus if you have a <b>/24</b> (normally called a
<b>class C</b>) network, and you want to allow only those machines access
to the web through the proxy, you would use the following (assuming that you
want the "class C" (properly a /24) 196.4.160.0 - 196.4.160.255 to have access:
</font></p><hr><font face="arial,helvetica">
<pre>acl ourallowedhosts src 196.4.160.0/255.255.255.0
acl all src 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
http_access allow ourallowedhosts
http_access deny all
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
The "src" option on the first line is one of the options you can use to
decide what acl the person is in. You can also choose based on things like
the current time, and the site that they are going to. For more options
have a look at the <i>/usr/local/squid/etc/squid.conf.default</i> file
squid installs on your system.
</p><p>
If a user from 196.4.160.* connects using TCP and request a URL, Squid will
work it's way through the list of http_access lines (since it's a TCP
connection, the client is going to use the HTTP method to request the
object). It works through this list <b>From TOP to BOTTOM,
stopping after the FIRST match</b> to decide which one they are in.
In this case, Squid will match on the first http_access line, 
Since the policy that matched is <i>allow</i>, squid would proceed to allow
their request.
</p><p>
Re-writing the acl list above as follows:
</p><hr>
<pre>acl ourallowedhosts src 196.4.160.0/255.255.255.0
acl all src 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
http_access deny all
http_access allow ourallowedhosts
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
Will <b>not</b> work, as squid will match on the first "http_access" line,
and deny all users to connect.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<font size="+1"><b>More advanced options</b></font>
</p><p>
The default squid.conf has a few default settings in another form:
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<pre>acl manager proto cache_object
acl localhost src 127.0.0.1/255.255.255.255
acl all src 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
http_access deny manager !localhost
http_access allow  all
</pre>
<p>
The "proto" field in the first line means that the acl blocks a specific
protocol, in this case the "cache_object" protocol. It could just as easily
be the "ftp" or "http" protocols. If you haven't heard of the "cache_object"
protocol, don't worry - it's a squid-only protocol that returns information
to the sender as to how the cache is configured, or how it is running.
It falls in the "http_access" section of the config as it is essentially
an HTTP request to squid, but instead of connecting somewhere else to get
a web page that it refers to, Squid just manufactures the info.
</p><p>
The above example therefore says:
If you get a connection trying to use the cache_object protocol (as defined
in the manager acl), deny it, unless it's from the acl localhost. Thus a
program running on the actual cache server can get info about squid's
internal status, but not any machine on the outside. (remember that the
character "!" means NOT - so we are saying "deny manager NOT localhost"). We
also allow client machines in any network access.
</p><p>
<font size="+1"><b>Destination address based acls</b></font>
</p><p>
One example that people quite often need is to disable access to a list
of sites that are "unappropriate". Squid is NOT optimised to do this for
a large number of sites, but will handle a sufficient number for most people
without much of a problem.
</p><pre>acl adults dstdomain playboy.com sex.com
acl ourallowedhosts src 196.4.160.0/255.255.255.0
acl all src 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
http_access deny adults
http_access allow ourallowedhosts
http_access deny all
</pre>
This means that machines requesting urls going to playboy.com or sex.com
will match on the first http_access deny line... when the http_access lists
are checked all machines requesting adult sites (even if they are not ours)
will be denied.  If they pass that rule, we check if they are from our IP
address range, if so, they are allowed access. If they aren't in our address
range then they match the <i>all</i> acl, and match the last http_access rule
and are denied.
<p>
There is a problem with acls like this though - if the person specifies
the machine (like www.playboy.com) by it's IP address, the acl's
won't match (they are looking for the DOMAIN in the acl...)
so you need something that uses a <i>dst</i> acl, and if it matches that
throw it out...
