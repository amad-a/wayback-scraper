MONEY SO FAST YOUR HEAD WILL SPIN!!! READING THIS COULD CHANGE<br>YOUR LIFE! I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. A little while back, I<br>was browsing through newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article<br>similar to this that said you could make thousands of dollars within weeks with only an<br>initial investment of $6.00! So I thought, "Yeah right, this must be a scam", but like most<br>of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 to each of the<br>6 names and address stated in the article. You then place your own name and address in<br>the bottom of the list at #6, and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. (There are<br>thousands) No catch, that was it. So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people<br>first, I thought about trying it. I figured: "what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and<br>$6.00, right?" Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!! Within 7 days, I<br>started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I figured it would end soon but the<br>money just kept coming in. In my first week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the<br>second week I had made a total of over $1,000.00! In the third week I had over<br>$10,000.00 and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of<br>just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly. It's certainly worth $6.00, and 6<br>stamps, I have spent more than that on the lottery!! Let me tell you how this works and<br>most importantly, why it works. Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so<br>you can get the information off of it as you need it. I promise you that if you follow the<br>directions exactly, that you will start making more money than you thought possible by<br>doing something so easy! Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (print it out or<br>download it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in! It's easy. It's<br>legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage) IMPORTANT: This is not a<br>rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; and it is virtually no risk - it really works!!!! If all<br>of the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends.<br>PLEASE NOTE: Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be<br>yours in 20 to 60 days. This program remains successful because of the honesty and<br>integrity of the participants. Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the<br>instructions. You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business your<br>product is not solid and tangible, it's a service. You are in the business of developing<br>Mailing Lists. Many large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists.<br>However, the money made from the mailing lists is secondary to the income which is made<br>from people like you and me asking to be included in that list. Here are the 4 easy steps to<br>success: STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of<br>paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST ." Now get 6 US $1.00 bills and<br>place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the<br>envelope (to prevent thievery). Next, place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal<br>them. You should now have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the<br>above phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating a<br>service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate service and<br>you are paying for it! Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the<br>legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and<br>they confirmed that it is indeed legal! Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses: #1)<br>Laura Fitch 2001 Kirby, Suite 500 Houston, TX 77019 #2)Sean Diamond 27600 Kings<br>Manor Dr. #1511, Kingwood, TX 77339 #3) N. Gill, 126 South Prince Dr. Depew, NY<br>14043. #4) John Horsley General Delivery #5) Joe Im 1501 Sutter Creek Dr. El Dorado<br>Hills, CA 95762 Afton, WY 83110 #6)Matt Voorhees RR 3 Box 294 Peru, IN 46970<br>STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the other names up<br>(6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR Name as number 6 on the list. STEP 3:<br>Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as close to original as possible.<br>Now, post your amended article to at least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are close to<br>24,000 groups) All you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money<br>you make! This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302 &amp;<br>1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and, whenever you<br>need money, you can use it again, and again. PLEASE REMEMBER that this program<br>remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by their<br>carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of integrity, the<br>program will continue and the money that so many others have received will come your<br>way. NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either on a<br>computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES that you are<br>truly providing a service. (Also, it might be a good idea to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper<br>to reduce the risk of mail theft.) So, as each post is downloaded and the directions<br>carefully followed, six members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List<br>Developer with one dollar each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that<br>when your name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of dollars in<br>CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the first six people listed<br>above) Send it now, add your own name to the list and you're in business! DIRECTIONS<br>FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS------------ STEP 1) You do not need to<br>re-type this entire letter to do your own posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning<br>of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this document, and select 'copy' from<br>the edit menu. This will copy the entire letter into the computer's memory. STEP 2) Open<br>a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the blank page. From the 'edit'<br>menu select 'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter into notepad so that you can add<br>your name to the list. STEP 3) Save your new notepad file as a text file. If you want to do<br>your postings in different settings, you'll always have this file to go back to. STEP 4) Use<br>Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for various newsgroups (on-line forums,<br>message boards, chat sites, discussions.) STEP 5) Visit these message boards and post this<br>article as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter and selecting paste from the<br>edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that everyone sees as they scroll<br>through the list of postings in a particular group, click the post message button. You're<br>done with your first one! Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to<br>different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang of it, it will take about 30<br>seconds for each newsgroup! **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU<br>POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A<br>MINIMUM OF 200** That's it! You will begin receiving money from around the world<br>within days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O. Box due to the large amount<br>__________________________________________________ MONEY SO FAST<br>YOUR HEAD WILL SPIN!!! READING THIS COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE!
