<br>
Jerusalem Water Undertaking is located in the Ramallah District of the Palestinian Territories. This district includes one major urban area, the twin cities of Ramallah / El-Bireh, and about 100 villages, municipalities and refugee camps. The region that obtains its water services from the Jerusalem Water Undertaking includes the Ramallah / El-Bireh cities, four other municipalities, 40 villages and 5 refugee camps. (The remaining villages in the Ramallah District that are not served by JWU are either provided with water by the Israeli Civil Administration or not yet served ). The served area extends over 500 square kilometers and includes over 25,000 connections serving a population of over 200,000 people.
<p>
<b>HISTORICAL REVIEW </b>
</p><p>
Until the later 1950s, the population of Ramallah and El-Bireh
depended almost entirely on cisterns for drinking water with the
exception of a few local springs. Following the war of 1948 and
the resulting influx of Palestinian refugees into the area, the
need to increase the water supply in the region became vital.
Thus the Ramallah / El-Bireh Water Company was established to
deal with this burden and supply water to the area. The new company
planned to draw on Ein-Fara Springs northeast of Jerusalem and
succeeded in concluding an agreement with Arab east Jerusalem
Municipality. <br>
A distribution network and a main pipeline were constructed for
the purpose of conveying water from Jerusalem to the Ramallah
/ El-Bireh area. The limited quantities of water were insufficient
for the population of these communities and search for new water
sources is necessary.
</p><p>
In 1963, the Jordanian government concluded an agreement with
the International Development Agency (IDA) for a loan of $3.5
millions to develop drinking water projects in parts of the Kingdom.
The government decided to utilize the underground water at Ein-Samia
and started to build what later became known as the Ein-Samia
Water Project.
</p><p>
Pursuant to the agreement made between the Jordanian government
and IDA, a law was issued in 1966 for the establishment of the
Jerusalem Water Undertaking (Ramallah District) with authority
to develop new water resources and control all water projects
in the area and with the responsibility of providing the population
with potable water. According to this law, the JWU was established
as a non-profit, independent, civil organization run by a Board
of Directors which includes representatives from the three main
municipalities in the area.
</p><p>
Since the occupation in 1967, the Israeli authorities subjected
all works and projects pertaining to water and water resources
to its direct supervision or control through the military order
No. 92/1967. The said order prevented any organization or undertaking
from the execution of any work connected with the running, management,
maintenance or development of water services or resources without
the prior approval and licensing from the Israeli military authorities.
</p><p>
Furthermore, in 1982 the Israeli occupation authorities dissolved
the city councils of Ramallah and El-Bireh thus disabling the
JWU Board of Directors that consists of two members from each
city from performing its duties. For five years and without the
Board of Directors, the general manager took it on his part to
make all the daily and strategic decisions to achieve the Undertaking's
goals and proceed with its strategic plans.
</p><p>
At the end of 1987, the Intifada started in the Occupied Palestinian
Territories. The whole political, social and financial situation
in the area changed. Many people became out of work thus putting
extra burden on the Undertaking as far as collecting water fees
from the consumers. Even through these tough days of Intifada,
the Undertaking managed to survive and even came out stronger
than ever.
</p><p>
JWU expected production for 1996 will exceed 5.0 MCM of water.
Since the total supply required will exceed 10 MCM, JWU will purchase
the remaining quantity, about 50% of its total supply, from the
Israeli company Mekeroth and the Jerusalem Municipality. In 1993
(before the operation of Well No. 4 and the utilization of the
newly drilled well no. 2 and the upgrading of well no. 3) this
percentage was even higher with 70% of JWU's supply purchased
from outside sources. This problem of insufficient resources is
the greatest problem faced by JWU and is clearly reflected in
the annual shortages that occur especially at the onset of the
summer season.

<b>Legal Status of JWU</b> 
</p><p>
Law No. 9 for the year 1966 was issued providing for the establishment
of an Undertaking under the name of Jerusalem Water Undertaking
(Ramallah District) empowered to develop new water resources and
control all water projects in the area and entrusted to provide
all the water needs for drinking and other municipal and domestic
purposes. According to the stated law, JWU was authorized to prescribe
water tariffs, cost of services, collection procedures, financial,
administrative and technical regulations to be approved by its
Board of Directors.
</p><p>
The JWU Board of Directors has introduced regulations and by-laws
to regulate all aspects of activities such as procurement, stores,
employees and fees. It has been noticed that JWU regulations and
by-laws do not cover certain activities that usually lie under
the responsibility of water utilities in the absence of any other
regulatory body, such as those activities that might have a negative
impact on water resources, environment, safety regulations, technical
standards and specifications as well as the licensing of contractors
working in this field.
</p><p>
Also, its envisaged that the existing regulations must be amended
if the responsibility for wastewater collection, treatment and
reuse is transferred totally or partially to JWU ( after the evaluation
studies taking place presently in this concern are completed and
found feasible).
