<h2><center><em>THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF JWU</em>
</center></h2>
The current organizational structure of JWU is the result of years of minor adjustments and changes to the original structure. Thus, the current structure does not properly reflect the distribution of functions and responsibilities among divisions and employees within the organization. JWU management recognizes these defects and sets its goals to achieve improvements in clearly defining the levels within the structure, structuring the lower levels, proper distribution of functions among organizational sections, separating customer services division and creating an Administrative Division that will report directly to the General Manager and bringing together existing functions such as the secretarial and computer services, as well as personnel and public relations.
<p>
<b><a name="_Toc342547222">THE ADMINISTRATION</a></b>
</p><p>
Administrative Affairs are run by a team of aides attached to
the General Manager's office. Presently, three sections report
directly to the Manager:
</p><p>
the Computer Section is running two Local Area Networks ( LANs
) operating 24 hours a day. The capacity of these networks is
4.5 GB. They support 25 concurrent users working on accounting,
engineering, invoicing, storing, personnel, word processing, transport
and technical services. The hardware and software in this section
are upgraded constantly to keep up with modern software programs,
thus improving the efficiency and the performance at JWU.
</p><p>
The Secretarial and General Services Section handles most of the
day-to-day secretarial activities in JWU. All of the word processing,
typing and filing takes place in this section. Consumers records,
contracts, national and international aid and all other kinds
of files are kept and maintained in this section.
</p><p>
Personnel and Public Relations Officer reports also to the General
Manager and handles contacts with employees and with national
and international organizations.

</p><p>
<b>THE TECHNICAL DIVISION</b>
</p><p>
The Technical Division in the Undertaking consists of two sections;
the network and the Meter Sections. The Network Section among
other things handles water distribution, maintenance of lines,
laying of new consumers connections, answering emergency calls
for network repairs, projects design, monitoring and supervision.
</p><p>
The Meter Section is responsible for installing new meters, dismantling
and maintaining used meters, recording the reading of meters,
distributing water bills and collecting payments from consumers
in addition to dealing with consumers complaints.
</p><p>
<b><a name="_Toc342472873"></a><a name="_Toc342473469"></a><a name="_Toc342547224"></a>THE
MECHANICAL DIVISION</b>
</p><p>
The primary responsibilities of the Mechanical Division are to
ensure the smooth running of all the wells, pumps and pumping
stations and fix as quickly as possible any malfunction in the
pumps and motors to ensure continuity of water distribution. All
mechanical and electrical designs, contract documents tendering,
maintenance for pumps equipment and vehicles are done by the mechanical
section, or under its full supervision.

the warehouses, inventory, book keeping, prepare financial statements,
reports, payroll, end- of- year balance sheet and final accounts,
in addition to receiving payments from consumers who wish to pay
at the Undertaking.

<b><a name="_Toc342472875"></a><a name="_Toc342473471"></a><a name="_Toc342547226"></a>PROPOSED
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES FOR JWU</b>
</p><p>
The proposed organizational structures were developed taking into
consideration the areas of concern and shortcomings identified
in the current organizational structure as well as the potential
requirements and future developments expected to take place on
both the long and short term.
</p><p>
<b><a name="_Toc342472876"></a><a name="_Toc342473472"></a>Short
Term Organizational Structure</b>
</p><p>
The proposed short term organizational structure was developed
in a manner which provides solutions to the areas of concern and
shortcomings identified in the current structure. The major changes
made with regard to this structure include:
</p><ul>
<li>The establishment of an Administrative Division
</li><li>The establishment of a Personnel and Public Relations Section
and the introduction of jobs related to this section.
</li><li>The introduction of the position of Purchasing Officer in
the Administrative Division.
</li><li>The introduction of the positions of Executive Secretary and
Development Coordinator reporting to the General Manager.
</li><li>The assignment of the responsibility of general maintenance
and transportation to the Mechanical Division through the establishment
of the Maintenance and Transport Section.
</li><li>The separation of the functions of the Network (previously
Technical) Division into a Planning and Projects Section and a
Network Operation and Maintenance Section.
</li><li>The separation of the section previously named the Water Meters
Section from the Technical Division and changing its name to the
Customers Services Division.
</li></ul>
<p>
The main structure of this proposal is shown in <b>Figure 3</b>.
</p><p>
<b><a name="_Toc342472877"></a><a name="_Toc342473473"></a>Long
Term Organizational Structure</b>
</p><p>
The proposed long term organizational structure <b>Figure 4</b>
takes into consideration all changes made on the short term as
well as potential requirements and development at JWU. The major
changes made in the long term (as compared to the short term)
include:
</p><ul>
<li>The introduction of the responsibility of sewerage and treated
water networks to the overall responsibilities of the JWU through
the establishment of the related sections in both the Mechanical
and Network Divisions.
</li><li>The introduction of the function of Quality Control to the
functions of the JWU through the establishment of the Quality
Control Division including the Inspection and Testing Section
and the Quality Assurance Section.
</li><li>The establishment of the Supplies Section in the Administrative
Division which includes the Purchasing and Inventory functions.
</li><li>The introduction of the function of Cost Accounting to the
Financial Division (previously Accounting Division) through the
establishment of the Cost Accounting and Financial Studies Section.
</li><li>The establishment of the Geographic Information and the Leak
Detection Units within the Network Division.
</li><li>The possible elimination of the Inspection and Collection
Division since door to door fee collection may not be required
in the future. The fee collectors will thus be transferred to
other jobs while the Unit Supervisor may be transferred to the
job of Inspector for the Customer Services Division.
</li><li>The establishment of the posts of Assistant to the General
Manager for Administrative, Financial and Quality Control and
Assistant to General Manager for Technical, Customer Services
and Mechanical Affairs.
</li></ul>
<p>
The number of Mechanics and Guards at the Ein Samya and other
Pumping Stations are expected to be reduced in the near future
once remote control is installed in these stations. These employees
will subsequently be transferred to other jobs at JWU, or their
contracts terminated.
