<h2><center><em>DISTRIBUTION NETWORK</em>
</center></h2>
The original network was laid by Ramallah El-Bireh Water Co. in the early 1950s. The pipes used, were not according to standard specifications, and pipes above 2 inch in diameter were second hand. The laying of  pipes was usually done for individual consumers and not for entire streets or areas. Most pipes were laid above ground and in privately owned land thus, making the pipes exposed to damage and breakage. In some cases, the consumers were allowed to purchase and install their own pipes. All this, resulted in a confused network with high losses and costly upkeep and maintenance.
<p>
<title>JWU - Distribution Network
</title>
</p><p>
Additionally, JWU took over the inoperative and obsolete networks
of Der Dibwan, Biteen and Kafr Malik which further impeded proper
performance of water supply and created more difficulties for
JWU.
</p><p>
At present, JWU uses galvanized steel pipes 3/4 - 2 inches in
diameter, threaded at both ends and are joined by threaded joints
in accordance with the ISO medium, BS 1387 medium DIN 2440 standards.
It also uses 3 - 16 inches in diameter pipes, with cement lining
and coated by two layers of asphalt and fiber glass or by plastic
wrapping to protect the pipes against corrosion and increase the
service lifetime. These pipes are joined together by welding as
per IS 530, BS 534 standards.
</p><p>
Due to lack of adequate funds, JWU was not able to expand its
distribution network to cover un-built sites or newly planned
zones in anticipation of connecting future buildings. JWU can
only connect pre-paying consumers taking into consideration the
possibility of future development in the particular area in as
far as what size of pipes to use when connecting the area.

The network in the main cities and villages consist of pipes connected
in rings as a circulation system. The total length of the distribution
network is 709,569 meters. The Following table and chart show

AND PLANNED WATER DISTRIBUTION PROJECTS</b>
</p><p>
JWU has prepared a study for the replacement of the old and obsolete
networks by using computer aided programs to determine future
consumer demands in the different areas and set priorities on
replacing these networks. Some replacements took place already,
such as increasing the conveying capacity of the Kafr-Malik and
Der-Dibwan lines by replacing the old small diameter pipes with
bigger diameters, others still taking place such as the old lines
in Ramallah and El-Bireh, yet, more will be planned when funds
become available. The following table shows ongoing and planned
network projects:

<p>
<b><a name="_Toc342472887"></a><a name="_Toc342473483"></a><a name="_Toc342547236"></a>PLANNED
ACTIONS</b>
</p><p>
1. <b>Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).</b> Incorrect, laying
of pipes, installation of manholes, and maintenance of meters
have been reported. JWU cannot ensure the proper carrying out
of technical activities without the existence of SOPs. The development
of these standard procedures should be assigned to consultants
and to a JWU engineer who will be instructed to work very closely
with the technical personnel who conduct these activities. All
new recruits should be trained on these SOPs and upon the introduction
of the SOPs all existing personnel should be retrained based upon
the SOPs.
</p><p>
2. <b>Following the implementation of the SOPs,</b> JWU should
consider implementing some form of reporting procedures following
maintenance and other technical activities. Reports should include
indications of labor and time required to execute the activity.
These reports can be subsequently used to estimate the cost of
these activities (to be used in the pricing of the activities)
and for performance evaluation of the employees.
</p><p>
3. <b>Maintenance Programs</b> for distribution network and pumps.
The implementation of Preventive Maintenance (PM) on the distribution
network and pumping stations will probably greatly reduce leakage
and break down of pumps. Maintenance cards should be prepared
and a computer system developed to keep up with the scheduled
maintenance activities.
</p><p>
This program will also provide in the future reports on the performance
history of each item maintained. The implementation of GIS and
a Leak Detection Unit (acting as an inspection team) will support
the implementation of PM.
</p><p>
4. <b>Classification of contractors.</b> Information on many of
the contractors with which JWU deals will be gathered and rated.
Prior to inviting any contractor to participate in a tender, it
is recommended that the contractor be required to fill out a special
form.
</p><p>
5. <b>Establish a system to test and license pipe fitters.</b>
In order to regulate this profession and keep up the work standards
at the premises of the public.
</p><p>
6. <b>Coordinate with the Engineers Association.</b> To establish
clear guidelines when planning new buildings and to indicate clearly
the locations of the interior pipes, tanks and possible location
of the meters taking into account, the Undertaking's rules and
regulations and safety factors.
</p><p>
7. <b>Establishment of the Geographic Information System ( GIS
).</b>
</p><p>
This system will include Computer Hardware, Software, Plotter,
Scanner Digitizing Equipment and Employee's Training, etc. The
mapping system in JWU is primitive since maps are updated manually.
There is a need for a system to store and retrieve maps as needed
and JWU is actively seeking funding for this system.
