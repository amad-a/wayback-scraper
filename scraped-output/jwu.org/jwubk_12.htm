<h2><center><i>Financial Considerations and Policy</i></center></h2>
<bold><h3>Introduction</h3>
</bold>
JWU is a civil establishment with financial and administrative autonomy. Its main objective, is to supply its consumers with drinking water. It is essential, in order to successfully accomplish this goal, to stay economically balanced. No money is spared at the expense of the standards and the efficiency of the undertaking. To ensure this balance, JWU reviews its water and other services pricing periodically and compares them with cost. The prices are then balanced by increments as required , taken into account the economic situation and the ability of the consumers to pay.
<title>JWU - Financial Considerations and Policy

<meta name="AUTHOR" content="uf]">
<p>
JWU has maintained this balance during the past 30 years, i.e.
its regular revenue covers its regular expenses. Development and
capital expenses are financed largely through grants from national
and international sources.
</p><p>
In 1993, JWU started adapting a cost recovery policy, and in order
to ensure that, detailed cost statements are prepared, and a cost
study was conducted by JWU staff with cooperation from Institute
Mediterranean DeL'au' ( IME ), the World Bank and the Principality
of Monaco.
</p><p>
The Board of Directors of JWU decided in 1993 to adapt a policy
of allocating 10% of all granted funds in a revolving fund for
reinvestment retroactive since 1985. JWU is considering ways to
invest this fund in the most secure, least risk and maximum return
investment.

</p><p>
<b>FINANCING SOURCES</b>
</p><p>
JWU depends on three main sources to finance its projects:
</p><p>
1. Internal self financing using its own income and earnings to
finance the daily work and the scheduled operations and maintenance.
</p><p>
2. A growing revolving fund for reinvestment. As of December 1994,
the balance in this fund is $ 572,312.27.
</p><p>
3. External financing from contributions by national and international
Development Agencies to finance capital projects that are beyond
JWU financing means such as drilling wells, building reservoirs
etc.
</p><p>
During the past 10 years, JWU utilized funds donated by the national
and international development agencies such as the World Bank,
UNDP, EEC, Arab Fund, the Islamic Development Bank, Community
Development Fund (CDF), the German Government through GTZ, Palestinian
Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR) and
the Joint Palestinian Jordanian Committee to finance the drilling
of 3 wells, rehabilitation main distribution lines through out
JWU pipeline networks, to construct reservoirs and increase the
conveyance capacity from own resources. The following "HONOR
LIST" illustrates the kind, amount and funder that invested
in JWU projects:

RATIOS AND REVENUE ANALYSIS</b>
</p><p>
To illustrate the financial position of the JWU, <b>Table 18 </b>shows
selected financial ratios as calculated based on the financial
statements of JWU 1994, compared to the respective ratios of selected
water authorities in different cities. It indicates that the working
ratio which shows the ratio between operation cost excluding depreciation
and the operating revenues is relatively high compared to other
water utilities in different cities, it is about 89% of operating
revenues. To add the depreciation to the operating cost, the operation
ratio excluding administration cost will increase to 107% of revenues.
This ratio also is higher than the ratios of the selected three
cities.
</p><p>

<p>
To consider the profitability of the JWU operations; the return
on equity has been calculated. It is about minus 0.004 of the
total owner equity, however, this ratio is very close to zero,
but it is acceptable for a non-profit organization. The ratio
between current assets and current liabilities in JWU is about
9.5, while more than 75% of water utilities that have been included
in the Transport Water and Urban Water and Sanitation (TWUWS)
report, 1993 have a current ratio of less than one, which means
that the current assets is higher than it should be, while the
amount of the accounts receivable is acceptable at JWU as indicated
by collection ratio. The collection of revenue takes on an average
of 1.7 months, while 59% of the total water utilities worldwide
have a collection period of two months and above as indicated
by TWUWS Report, 1993.
</p><p>
The operational revenues of JWU range between 7 to 8 $ million
a year. The total revenues are generated from four major sources
as followed:
</p><ul>
<li>Water sales, represent 83% of the total of operational revenues.
</li><li>Meter Rental, represents 5% of the total operational revenues.
</li><li>New connections, represent 9 % of operational revenues.
</li><li>Other revenues (including bank interest, fees, late payments
interest, insurance refunds, and other returns) represent 3% of
operational revenues
</li></ul>
<p>
Concerning the water sales items, the JWU has been supplying and
distributing water to subscribers at a specified tariff which
is subject to change based upon the changes in costs. Price changes
are proposed by the JWU for approval by the Officer in Charge
of Water Affairs of the Occupation Authority . JWU currently implements
a progressive tariff with the unit price increasing according
to the consumption of water. <b>Table 19</b> represents types
of subscribers based on the tariff applied, ratios of consumption
and revenues. The existing tariff (1995) is divided into four
categories:
</p><ul>
<li>Minimum Charge (for consumption up to 10 cubic meters): $12.66
per bill
</li><li>Consumption between 10 to 20 cubic meters (category 1): $1.00
/m<sup>3</sup>
</li><li>Consumption between 21 to 40 cubic meters (category 2): $1.05
/m<sup>3</sup>
</li><li>Consumption over 40 cubic meters (category 3): $1.50 /m<sup>3</sup>
</li><li>Meter Rental Fee $2.66 per connection
</li></ul>
<p>
Consumers are billed every two months.

ANALYSIS OF WATER AT JWU</b>
</p><p>
As indicated by the above figure the tariff employed varies and
ranges between $ 0.91 per m<sup>3</sup> to $1.32 per m<sup>3</sup>. The way the tariff
is stated encourwater conservation by increasing the rate for
high consumption. This leads to having different ratios of consumption
and returns as shown by <b>Table 19.</b> The distribution of consumption
in the tariff categories indicates that third category actually
subsidize others.

</p><p>
<b>FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM </b>
</p><p>
The present accounting system does not include a cost system or
relevant classifications to serve establishing a relevant cost
system. JWU entries and financial records are made according to
the double entry method rather than the single entry method used
by other water institutions in the West Bank. To verify costs
at each stage of water production and distribution, expenditures
are entered under different heads, namely: pumping, supply lines,
meters, stores, transport and administration.<br>
A chartered accountant audits JWU accounts and prepares its annual
balance sheet at the end of each fiscal year.

<b>Plans for Cost Reduction:</b>
</p><p>
JWU started a comprehensive analytical process to its costs componants
in order to reduce the cost per m<sup>3</sup> of water supplied to consumers.
The implementation and utilization of the appropriate technology
will lead to the reduction in labor cost, and preventive maintenance
and rehabilitation programs for networks also decrease the operation
cost.

COLLECTION</b>
</p><p>
Due to the prevailing social and political conditions in the area,
and the inefficiency of the postal and banking services, JWU was
compelled to distribute its bills directly to the consumers by
hand. This method, entails extra effort and cost to JWU that could
otherwise be saved. The following table and chart show how the
consumers paid their drinking water bills to JWU during 1990 and
1994:

<p>
Collection rate at JWU in 1994 is about 88% which is an excellent
collection rate in any standards. Very little if any pressure
is put on the consumers to pay their water bills especially in
the last few years due to the political and social hardship that
faced them. However, as stated earlier, the consumers showed an
excellent sense of cooperation and patronage by continuing to
pay their bills on time. A noticeable change is evident in the
trend of consumers payments i.e. in 1990, 41% of the payments
were made at JWU Head Office and 52% were paid to the JWU collectors
visiting the homes. In 1994 only 20.5% of the payments were made
at JWU Offices and 73% paid to the collectors. This change is
due to the frequent, strikes, curfews and closures of the areas
by the Israeli Military.

<b><a name="_Toc342472912"></a><a name="_Toc342473508"></a><a name="_Toc342547262"></a>FUTURE
PLANS IN FINANCE</b>
</p><p>
1.<b> Full Cost Recovery:</b> Despite of the deficiencies of certain
years, it can be said that the Undertaking achieved cost recovery.
Theoretically, the value of assets in balance sheet does not show
the real value due to world inflation and the constant devaluation
of Israeli Currency. The revaluation of the assets should be done
by the help of experts, the value of assets should be adjusted
when necessary in order to have the right depreciation value which
will lead to full cost recovery achievement.
</p><p>
2. <b>Periodical Budgets:</b> Divisions will be required to work
within pre-established budgets based upon the level of sales and
production expected that year or period. Cost control procedures
will be implemented, division managers held accountable for over-budget
expenses, budgeting the cost can be achieved, thus leading to
a sound water pricing policy.
</p><p>
<b>3. Find more profitable and secure methods to reinvest the
Undertaking revolving f.</b>
</p><p>
4. <b>Revaluation of the Undertaking's assets: </b>In order to
get the real depreciation value and true cost of water, the assets
of JWU should be reevaluated by experts in the field.
