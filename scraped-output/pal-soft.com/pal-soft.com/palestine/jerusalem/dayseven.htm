Two  Palestinians  were martyred at dawn Wednesday near the village of
Beitunya,  10  kilometers  south  west of Ramallah. Earlier, there was
another  martyr at the village of Kufer Manda across the green line in
1948-Palestine.  With  the  three  martyrs,  the  total of Palestinian
martyrs  since the beginning of the Al-Aqsa Intifadha rises to 65, and
the  number  of  injuries to more then 2000, scores of them sustaining
serious   gunshot   wounds   in  the  upper  parts  of  their  bodies,
particularly in the head and chest.
Israeli  army  continued  to  pound buildings and PA police positions,
using  helicopter  gunships  where  more  than  thirty casualties were
reported.
In   Hebron,  angry  Palestinian  demonstrators  yesterday  smashed  a
Palestinian  Authority police vehicle telling the security elements to
give  them  weapons or fight the occupation soldiers who are showering
civilians with live and rubber bullets.
A  Zionist  official  has  described  the  wave of protests convulsing
1948-occupied  Palestine  as  the  most  violent since the creation of
Israel   52   years   ago.   The   Zionist   state   is  treating  the
1948-Palestinians as an unwanted minority. Hence the bloody repression
of   Palestinian   protests   across  the  green  line.  At  least  10
Palestinians were killed and over 200 people injured in 1948 Palestine
so far.
Nine  Palestinian  citizens  receive  treatment  at  the ophthalmology
hospital  in  Gaza two of whom had completely lost their eyesight. One
of  them  11  years old Sulaiman Ibrahim lost his eyesight after being
shot  at  by  a  Zionist sniper near the settlement of Nitsarim to the
south of Gaza Strip, which turned into a real war arena.
