The  UN  human rights high commissioner Mary Robinson has been visiting the
West  Bank and the Gaza Strip where she is coming face to face with Israeli
repression  against the Palestinian people. Robinson met with PA officials,
human  rights  activists,  international observers, Red Cross officials and
families  of  Palestinian  victims.  She  examined directly the destruction
inflicted on Palestinian civilian targets by the Israeli occupation army.
In  the other hand, Armed Jewish settlers attacked the UN High Commissioner
for  Human  Rights  Mary  Robinson  while  on  a visit to Hebron to examine
widespread  vandalism  and  rampage  against  Palestinians. Settler men and
women began hurling stones and sharp objects on the delegation, forcing Mr.
Robinson  to  take  cover. As Robinson was leaving, settlers opened fire at
her car.
Seven  Palestinian  were  martyred  and  an  eighth succumbed to his wounds
Saturday.  This brings the Palestinian martyrdom toll since the outbreak of
al-Aqsa intifada to 203.
The  Palestinian  martyrs  are,  Majed  Husein Radwan (32 years old), Osama
Khalil AL-Bawab (28 years old) both from al Bireh, Muhammed Yasin al Madhun
(25  years  old),  Munzer  Hamdi  Yasin (24 years old) both from Gaza, Musa
Ibrahim al Debes (14 years old), Munib Abu Minshar (20 years old) both from
Hebron and Ayman Salah Wadi (20 years old) from Khan Younis.
An  explosive device went off this morning close to an Israeli convoy while
passing  near  the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darum established on the lands
of  Deir  Al-Balah town to the center of Gaza Strip. The explosion left two
Israeli soldiers injured.
Here are some photos of today :
