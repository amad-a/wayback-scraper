</p><p><b><font color="#000066">About the Victims of Human Rights Violations&nbsp;
( Rehabilitating Project ):</font></b>
</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">1. Background</font></b>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The Gaza Strip is a relatively small
piece of land, inhabited by nearly one million people. About 50% of the
population are under sixteen. The average population density is approximately
2150 persons per square KM, making the Strip one of the most densely populated
areas in the world. Unemployment is very high in the Gaza Strip, with conservative
estimates putting the figure at some 40% in the early 1990s. For this reason,
employment in Israel is especially important for people living in Gaza.
But this, in turn, leaves Palestinians vulnerable to exploitation on the
Israeli labor market. Unemployment puts a unique stress on the individual
and the family, frequently resulting in increased health problems and greater
health care needs at a time when income is low.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Mental health is one of many neglected
areas in the Palestinian health system. The recently revised national health
plan, while acknowledging the need for rehabilitation on paper, has little
to offer in terms of translating this into practice. There are currently
two psychiatric hospitals in the autonomous territories, one in the Gaza
Strip, and the other in the West Bank. They have limited staff, and offer
bedside care without any community mental health services. The 32 psychiatric
beds within the Gaza psychiatric unit represent a figure of 0.04 beds per
1,000 people, and in a region afflicted with some of the most acute psychological
problems anywhere in the world. Nor are there any NGOs working in the area
of mental health in the Gaza Strip other than the GCMHP.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">2. Problem Definition</font></b>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The Palestinian uprising, "The Intifada",
was a mass movement of civil disobedience and rebellion against the foreign
military occupation.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The cost of the Intifada was high, as
the Israeli authorities exercised violent means to suppress the uprising.&nbsp;
50,000 were arrested during the Intifada. 250,000 Files for Palestinian
prisoners were opened in Israeli Military court since the occupation in
1967.(El Damier, 1997).</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The Landau Commission, set up by the
Israeli High Court of Justice (Siegel-Itzkovich, 1993), has confirmed that
Israeli military and secret police use methods of torture, especially during
the interrogation of the detainee. Landau Commission guidelines themselves
permit the use of “moderate physical pressure”. The UN Committee against
Torture considered Israel’s initial report. The Committee found the authorization
of the use of “moderate physical pressure” to be “completely unacceptable”
and expressed concern at the “large number of heavily documented cases
of ill-treatment in custody”. The Committee recommended that the interrogation
procedures be published and that all interrogation practices in breach
of the Convention be ended immediately (Amnesty International Report, 1995).</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The report of Human Rights Watch/Middle
East on Israeli interrogation of Palestinians from the Occupied Territories
(Sept. 1997) mentioned that the two main Israeli interrogation agencies
in the Occupied Territories engage in a systematic practice of mistreatment
and torture -- according to internationally recognized definitions of the
terms -- when trying to extract confessions or information about third
parties.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The overriding strategy of Israeli interrogation
agencies is to get uncooperative detainees to talk. They do so by subjecting
them to a coordinated, rigid, and increasingly painful regime of physical
constraints and psychological pressures over days – and very often for
three or four weeks – during which the detainees are, almost without exception,
denied visits by their lawyers and families.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The methods used in nearly all interrogations
include prolonged sleep deprivation; prolonged sight deprivation using
blind folds or tight fitting hoods; the forced and prolonged maintenance
of particular body positions, which grow increasingly painful; and verbal
threats and insults. These methods are almost always combined with some
of the following abuses: confinement in tiny, closet-like spaces; exposure
to temperature extremes, such as deliberately overcooled rooms; prolonged
toilet and hygiene deprivation; and degrading treatment, such as forcing
detainees to eat and use the toilet the same time. In a large number of
cases, detainees are also moderately or severely beaten by their interrogators
(El-Sarraj, 1995).</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Palestinian detainees continued to be
systematically tortured or ill-treated during interrogation by the General
Security Service (GSS), often while held incommunicado. Methods used included
hooding with dirty sacks, shackling in painful positions for prolonged
periods, beatings, sleep deprivation and confinement in dark, closet-sized
cell (Amnesty International Report, 1995).</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">Imprisonment by the Palestinian Authority</font></b>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">In the last three years of Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) rule, it launched a number of collective imprisonment
campaigns, directed mainly against the members of opposition parties, with
a particular focus on Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The number of political
prisoners has reached approximately 1593 (Palestinian Center of Human Rights
1997). From our clinical experience in treating some of these prisoners,
we have found that various kinds of torture methods have been employed.
In fact, many have been subjected to torture techniques similar to those
used by the Israelis.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">3. The Human Rights Team</font></b>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The Human Rights Team was established
in 1994 to deal with the consequences of human rights violations. The Team
had consists of 19 professionals, including psychiatrists, clinical psychologists,
social workers, psychiatric nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists,
and paramedics. In the last three years, the Team has treated 506 victims
of human rights violations. It utilizes various therapeutic approaches,
such as supportive therapy, counseling, cognitive-behavioral therapy, occupational
therapy, and family counseling in order to study the effects of torture
on its victims, and on the community as a whole.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The team members participated in GCMHP's
second intentional conference, "Palestinians in Transition: Rehabilitation
and Community Development”, and <b><i><a href="confer.htm">third international
conference, "Health and Human Rights"</a></i></b>, which were held in Gaza
in 1995 and 1997 respectively.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The Human Rights Team has also launched
a program of various training activities for the local community. In three
years (1994-1997), 14 journal clubs, study days, seminars, and case conferences
have been conducted by the Team. Two courses in community mental health
for 24 health professionals were conducted in the last two years, as well
as six courses for social workers, former political prisoners, community
leaders, and community development workers. 106 people participated in
these courses. Furthermore, 16 workshops were held for health and non-health
professionals in the field of mental health and human rights. The Team,
in an effort to increase public awareness of the psychological effects
of torture and of new approaches to the torture experience, held 28 public
meetings. These meetings attracted people from various sectors of society
from all over the Gaza Strip.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Moreover, Team members have attended
international conferences outside Gaza in an effort to share their particular
experience with other professionals in the fields of mental health and
human rights.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The Team’s continuing in-service training
is a part of the general training programme. Team members participated
in two courses: A course in group therapy (1994-1998), which is supervised
by a South African consultant psychotherapist, and a course in psychotherapy
(1993-1997), which was held at Tel-Aviv University.</font>
</p><p dir="LTR"><b><font color="#000066">4. Objectives</font></b>
</p><p dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">1) To clarify the health, social, educational
