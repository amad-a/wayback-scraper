<h2><font color="green">What is Neuroblastoma?</font></h2>
</center>
<p align="justify">
    Neuroblastoma is a malignant tumor derived from primitive
    neural crest cells. It belongs to a group of neuroblastic tumors, which include <em>ganglioneuroblastoma</em>
    (a malignant tumor comprised of mature ganglion cells and nerve fibers, regarded by many
    to be a fully&nbsp;differentiated neuroblastoma) and <em>ganglioneuroma</em> (a benign
    tumor composed of Schwann and ganglion cells). 
<p align="justify">
    Many parents say that it is
    difficult for them to understand the differences between neuroblastoma,
    ganglioneuroblastoma, and ganglioneuroma. To further clarify, <em>ganglioneuroblastoma</em>
    is a cancerous neural tumor, however, most will act benign. A ganglioneuroblastoma may
    look similar to a neuroblastoma on imaging, but the prognosis is better for children with
    these tumors. A <em>ganglioneuroma</em> is a&nbsp; well encapsulated non-cancerous tumor
    composed of mature ganglion cells and nerve fibers. Ganglioneuromas do not spread to other
    areas like cancerous tumors. <em>Neuroblastoma</em> is a cancerous tumor that arises from
    the tissues that form the sympathetic nervous system. It is an aggressive malignancy that
    tends to metastasize rapidly to other areas of the body. 
<p align="justify">
    Progress made in the past few decades has improved survival rates for infants and older
    children with localized disease. However, long-term survival for older children with
    metastatic (wide spread) disease at diagnosis remains poor.
<p align="justify">
    Researchers study the clinical and biologic appearance of neuroblastoma to form a
    better understanding of the disease, the risk of recurrence, and to develop therapies
    based on factors other than age and stage.
