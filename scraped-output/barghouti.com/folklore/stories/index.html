<h1>Palestinian Folktales</h1>
</center>
<hr size="5" width="50%">
<font size="+2">T</font><font size="+1">he folktale was the major nightly 
entertainment in the early days before television and radio.  The story 
teller was usually the grandfather, the grandmother, or one of the 
parents.<br>
<br>
In every town there used to be what was called <i>madhafah</i> (guest 
house) where visitors to the town would stay and be welcomed.  The 
<i>Hakawaaty</i> (story teller), who was the entertainer in the 
<i>madhafah</i>, would tell the audience a story while playing a soft 
tune on his <i>rababah</i> (one-stringed violin-like instrument).  The 
<i>Hakawaaty</i> would tell stories such as <i>Kulaib and Zeer, Abu Zeid, 
'Antara, Arabian Nights</i>, and other short ones he might have heard in 
other towns.<br> <br>
The family would enjoy their story time at night especially in the 
winter.  The children would be sitting around the <i>kanoon</i> (brazier) 
while the grandfather, the grandmother, or whoever is the story teller 
would be telling the story of that night.<br>
