<font size="+2">Love In Four Languages</font><br> 
(from the Book of Translations)
<p>
a book of Kurdish melodies<br> 
a book of Arabic proverbs<br> 
a books of Turkish memories<br> 
a book of English adorations<br> 
</p><p>
Tonight<br> 
come to me<br> 
in a dream<br> 
On this night<br> 
we will be born into one<br> 
from this dream<br> 
Outwit the quickness<br> 
of your thoughts<br> 
that are unsure<br> 
Outwit the alertness<br> 
of my heart<br> 
that is trembling<br> 
Open softly<br> 
the door of me<br> 
Translate this love<br> 
in all of your languages<br> 
</p><p>
<b>I</b><br> 
Kurdish<br> 
I am watching the stars<br> 
Whisper nothing, even less<br> 
Shelter my eyes with your hands<br> 
Open your rose petal lips<br> 
drink the cream of my skin<br> 
I am in exile<br> 
Unable to eat or sleep, ecstatic<br> 
in shrouds<br> 
in ashes<br> 
on the shore of a continent<br> 
that carries your name<br> 
</p><p>
<b>II</b><br> 
Arabic<br> 
The moon ascends<br> 
Seven years the moon rose<br> 
then fell as I waited<br> 
at seven gates<br> 
Pale as this night<br> 
My heart lived shut<br> 
like a pearl<br> 
Trampled by war<br> 
at the borders<br> 
of sunrise and sunset<br> 
Men were bees<br> 
whose wings carreid honey<br> 
swarming to nest<br> 
before you<br> 
</p><p>
<b>III</b><br>
Turkish<br>
I am listening to the Sea<br> 
It is you<br> 
that enters me<br> 
without words <br>
without mercy <br>
Sharp as a knife <br>
The steel of your fingers <br>
crushes my bones into stars <br>
Your cries are my cries <br>
I fly <br>
on the breath of your soul <br>
on the scent of your skin <br>
Swear as I do <br>
we are clear, we are<br> 
surrendering nothing <br>
to all heaven and earh <br>
Say- <br>
you take <br>
what is yours <br>
</p><p>
<b>IV</b> <br>
English <br>
Constellations move <br>
in your eyes, I pour <br>
down your chest like soft rain <br>
you shudder <br>
under the fall of my fingertips <br>
Columns of marble <br>
Your thighs are veined with sapphire <br>
My hands gather you <br>
soldier, my king <br>
you are here without words <br>
or maps <br>
at the mouth of the Nile <br>
Your history is written <br>
on the waves that dissolve <br>
between my lips <br>
You have slept in my blood <br>
While I slept on a bed of fire <br>
I am on the bridge to Damascus <br>
I am beneath the Polar star <br>
I am naked before Heaven <br>
I am shameless, speechless, blind without limbs <br>
in your arms <br>
You call my name <br>
I dissolve in a bed of tulips <br>
Your hands pull out my life <br>
You fill me with yours <br>
I am ablaze <br>
thirsting in a garden <br>
that glistens with tears <br>
You call my name <br>
your tongue carries me water <br>
I find you <br>
above me <br>
wordless <br>
waiting <br>
still as a storm <br>
your heart exploding <br>
inside me <br>
