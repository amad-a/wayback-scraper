</b></font>
</p><p>"To see deer" she said," you must get up at dawn,
<br>And stay downwind, 
<br>For I know a couple with their fawn, 
<br>Come down at night and sit in
<br>The tall grass until sunrise,
<br>And then, they move on."
</p><p>It was the third in September,
<br>The smell of Fall, the cool breeze,
<br>The rustle of the trees, and yellow leaves,
<br>Black birds perching on the wire like beads,
<br>The hills and windmills are dark and still,
<br>And sure enough the ears of a deer,
<br>Scanning the meadow between mouthfuls of grass,
<br>And its slender jaws moving from side to side,
<br>With an occasional quiver of its hide.
</p><p>Otherwise, the universe seems to have taken
<br>A deep breath
<br>And held it inside, but meanwhile death
<br>Has let go, its arrow from its fully stretched bow, 
<br>And where the deer stood just a moment ago, 
<br>Now just air
<br>And broken blades of grass and there,
<br>The last mouthful was only half in,
<br>And warm crimson blood no faster than running tears,
<br>Ran down from a hole where the cream colored hair
<br>Met the line of soft white fuzz,
<br>Between the neck and the upper chest
<br>And one, wide open eye,
<br>Its long black lashes pointing to the sky
<br>With a thousand why, 
<br>A life! a soul mate! a meadow rendered deerless.
