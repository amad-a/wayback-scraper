<title>The Giant</title>
 <font size="+2">The Giant</font><br><br>
There is a sleeping giant<br>
Who goes by many names:<br>
Avenger, Warrior, Punisher;<br>
His greatest name is Servant.<br>
His size is overwhelming,<br>
His strength beyond a legend.<br>
His purpose is to serve his<br>
Many names: Morality and Truth;<br>
Righteousness and Trust;<br>
Compassion, Brotherhod and Family Love;<br>
Honesty and Ethics;<br>
Justice and Respect; Honor, Goodness,<br>
And so many more;<br>
The giant has been tricked<br>
by corruption, lies, deceit,<br>
Into falling deep into<br>
A dreamless sleep.<br>
But beware, whosoever of you<br>
Bathe in evil, and prevail<br>
Upon others to do great wrongs,<br>
Beware!<br>
Run and hide behind your trees,<br>
For the giant, whose greatest name<br>
Is Servant, is awakening,<br>
And his roars of anger<br>
Will crumble mountains.<br>
