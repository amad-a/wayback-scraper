<p>GUSH SHALOM - pob 3322, Tel-Aviv 61033 - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010211142623/http://www.gush-shalom.org/">http://www.gush-shalom.org/</a><br>

Press Release 7/11/2000<br>
<br>
In the past twenty-four hours, an attack is being mounted against
Gush <br>
Shalom (The Israeli Peace Bloc). Knesset Member Collette Avital (Labor)
<br>
has actually lodged a complaint with the police, claiming that
cartoons <br>
presented on our website constitute &quot;incitement&quot;. And
the powerful American <br>
Jewish organization &quot;Anti-Defamtion League&quot; found time,
even on Elections <br>
Day over there, to  disseminate a message of defamation against
Gush <br>
Shalom, which already resulted in hate emails being sent to our
address. All <br>
this seems to be part of the ugly atmosphere of witchhunt which
begins to <br>
pervade Israeli public life in the past weeks - particularly
manifested in <br>
inflammatory accusations and police investigations against
Knesset Member <br>
Muhammad Barake of Hadash and his fellow Arab parliamentarians.
This <br>
campaign is apparently intended to delegitimize all those who
dare to speak <br>
out against the oppressive policies of the Barak Government.  <br>
Following is Gush Shalom's answer to Rabbi David Rosen of the <br>
Anti-Defamation League. We also advise you to see for yourself
the cartoons <br>
in question, on our website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010211142623/http://www.gush-shalom.org/">http://www.gush-shalom.org/</a>

frontpage and in the &quot;gallery&quot;.<br>

Gush Shalom Infoteam <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
To <br>
Rabbi David Rosen<br>
Anti-Defamation League <br>
<br>
Tel-Aviv, 7/11/2000<br>
<br>
Dear Sir<br>
<br>
In an ADL press release which was published today you are quoted
as <br>
expressing &quot;outrage&quot; at Gush Shalom's portrayal of
Prime Minister Barak as <br>
a killer of Palestinian children in a caricature on its web site,
and as stating <br>
that &quot;The image of a militant Barak standing on the bleeding
bullet-ridden <br>
body of a Palestinian child is abhorrent&quot;. <br>
We fully share your feelings of outrage and abhorrence - outrage
and <br>
abhorrence not at a cartoon, a few bytes of virtual reality, but
at the true cruel <br>
reality which that cartoon faithfully reflects. A reality being
enacted day after <br>
day after day in the Occupied Territories, a reality of Israeli
military snipers <br>
taking careful aim with their telescopic sights and shooting high-velocity
<br>
ammunition at unarmed opponents - men and women, boys and girls. <br>
Snipers aiming carefully at the upper part of the body, shooting
with <br>
deliberation and the full intention of causing death or grave
injury. One of <br>
these snipers spoke on prime time Israeli TV two weeks ago,
describing <br>
quite frankly what he is about. He was not particularly happy
about what he <br>
is doing - which did not prevent him from going on doing it day
after day. <br>
(Surely his regret is a great consolation to the parents of his
victims). <br>
Yes, we do indeed feel quite a lot of outrage and abhorrence at
this reality in <br>
which we live: a reality of blood and brains dripping off into
the dust, of more <br>
than a hundred young lives extinguished, of thousands of other
young lives <br>
irrevocably crippled and blighted. Lives such as that of the 14-year
old girl <br>
Ghazala Jradat, hit in the head by an Israeli bullet and left
clinically dead on <br>
the afternoon of Saturday, November 4 - the very same day on
which Mr. <br>
Ehud Barak, Prime Minister and Defence Minister of Israel, had
the <br>
unbelievable chutzpa to mount the podium at the Rabin Memorial
Rally in Tel-<br>
Aviv, address a crowd estimated at 150,000 people and unblikingly
present <br>
himself as &quot;A peace seeker&quot;(sic).           <br>
Outrage and abhorrence is, indeed, what we feel. Also some twinge
of guilt - <br>
for not only did practically all of us in Gush Shalom vote <br>
for Barak last year, but we even published an ad endorsng his
candidature. <br>
Of course, we did it in the sincere hope that he would be true to
his <br>
campaign promises, that he would indeed make a historical peace
with our <br>
Palestinian neighbors. Neverthless, now that reality turned out
to be <br>
diametrically opposite, we bear a share in the responsibility for
horrors <br>
perpetrated by the leader we chose. We are all the more duty
bound to raise <br>
our voice in the loudest protest which we could manage with our
limited <br>
means and resources. <br>
The cartoon of which you speak, which depicts Mr. Barak with but
a small <br>
portion of the ugliness with which he so richly deserves to be
shown, is part <br>
of that protest, part of our expression of outrage and abhorrence.
Publishing <br>
it is, in our view, about the most fitting and becoming act which
an Israeli <br>
organization advocating peace can perform at the present dark and
shameful <br>
period in the history of our country. <br>
<br>
Still, after consulting with my fellow activists I am in a
position to make an <br>
offer. Should a complete week - seven (7) days - pass in which
not a single <br>
unarmed Palestinian is killed by the Israeli armed forces which
are <br>
answerable to Mr. Barak, we would  remove the abovementioned
cartoon <br>
from our website. <br>
<br>
As for the ADL - an organization which claims to &quot;counteract
hatred, <br>
prejudice and bigotry&quot; - can you truly find no other places
to search for such, <br>
with Israeli society in its present condition,  except at our
modest website?    <br>
<br>
Yours<br>
<br>

ADL Outraged at &quot;Peace&quot; Group's Portrayal of Prime
Minister Barak as Child<br>
Killer<br>
<br>
<br>
Jerusalem November 7, 2000.The Anti-Defamation League expressed <br>
outrage at Gush Shalom's portrayal of Prime Minister Barak as a
killer of <br>
Palestinian children in a caricature on its web site.<br>
<br>
&quot;The image of a militant Barak standing on the bleeding
bullet ridden body<br>
of a Palestinian child is abhorrent and certainly unbecoming of a
group<br>
which describes itself as &quot;advocating peace,&quot; said
Rabbi David Rosen,<br>
Director of ADL's Israel Office.<br>
<br>
&quot;At this particularly tense time, and as we are
commemorating the fifth<br>
anniversary of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin it behooves
individuals<br>
and organizations to express their political views in a
responsible <br>
manner avoiding inciteful language and imagery. Regretfully, this
is not<br>
the only example of offensive and inciteful web postings by Gush
Shalom,&quot;<br>
he added.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Anti-Defamation League, founded in 1913, is the world's
leading<br>
organization fighting anti-Semitism through programs and services
that<br>
counteract hatred, prejudice and bigotry.<br>
