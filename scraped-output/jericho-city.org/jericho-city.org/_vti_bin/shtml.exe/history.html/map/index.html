<p><font face="Arial">The origin of the name, &quot;Jericho&quot; is Semitic. The common
people pronounce it &quot;Riha&quot;. To the Cananaites it meant &quot;the moon&quot;. The
word is derived from the verb &quot;yerihu&quot;, and &quot;Yarah&quot;. Al-Yarah in the
language of southern Arabia means &quot;a month&quot; and &quot;moon&quot;. In Hebrew
&quot;yarihu&quot; is the most ancient known city in the Jewish Bible. &quot;Riha&quot; in
Syriac means &quot;scent and odour.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Arabs knew the city of Jericho referred to in the Bible by the
name &quot;Raiha&quot; and &quot;Ariha&quot;.Yaqut, the writer of &quot;Mu'jam
al-Buldan,&quot; mentions that it is the city of Al-Jabbarin (the Mighty) in the Ghaur,
and that it was called Ariha Ibn Malik Ibn Arfakhshad Ibn Sam Ibn Noah, may peace be upon
him. He mentions another name for it, Ariha' mentioned in the poetry of Jarir: <br>
I shall have to increase that suspicion which has beset the slave of Banu Numair. <br>
The devils of the land fear my roar, and the serpent of Aryaha' has responded to me.<br>
Yaqut also refers to it in the form &quot;Ariha'. in the measure &quot;af'al&quot;. He
quotes Al-Hutahle's saying: I searched for it (my sword) among the swords of Jericho, and
when it returned to my hand I found no parallel to it.<br>
Al-Bakri says. &quot;It is 'Ariha', or perhaps 'Ariha', when attributing (a noun ) to it
they just say 'Aryahiyy', It was called, &quot;Anthony's present to Cleopatra, when Egypt
fell under the rule of Anthony, Cleopatra, the beautiful Queen of Egypt met him. He was so
bewitched by her beauty that he deserted his wife, sister of Octavious ( Augustus ).
Cleopatra deprived her lover of his will-power for nine whole months. He became infatuated
with her and offered her a large section of Syria. The Palestinian shores, together with
Jericho and its groves abundant with balm, as well as the Dead Sea, were among what he
offered Cleopatra.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The city of Jericho was called &quot;Wadi As-Saisaban, Valley of
Sesban&quot;. It was given this name because of the abundance of a certain plant that
grows there. It densely entwines round its groves like a fence, and is still found there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It was also called, &quot; Tall As-Sultan &quot; ( the Hill of the
Sultan ) or &quot; Ain Alisha' &quot; ( The Spring of Alisha' ), as ancient Jericho was
merely a small artificial hill called &quot; Tall as-Sultan &quot;, which is the precursor
( origin ) of the first city. It was also called &quot; Madinat an-Nakhil &quot; (The City
of Palms) because palm trees grow in its soil and are abundantly found in it. It was also
called &quot; Ruwaiha &quot; ( the diminution of Raiha' ) which is eight miles away to the
south east of present Jericho. Rousseau has defined Ariha and Riha as each one is
applicable, to the city and region together.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#408080"><strong><a name="Second: Jericho in History until the time of the Arabs">Second: Jericho in History
until the time of the Arabs</a></strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Jericho is one of the most ancient human habitations. The most
ancient human remains were found in it, some of which go back to 5000 years B.C. Others
believe that these remains go back to 7000 years B.C. The most recent opinion on this
subject is that they date back to 8000 years B.C.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The site of ancient Jericho is half a kilometre away from modern
Jericho at a depth of 820 feet ( 250 metres) below sea level. It lies at latitude 31 52
degrees north and longitude 35 39 degrees east. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The evidence indicating that it is one of the most ancient cities in
the world is borne up by a series of excavations made at &quot; Tall as-Sultan &quot;,
which is oval in shape, formed by the successive accumulation of ruins with the passing of
time. Excavations have been continuing successively since the middle of the nineteenth
century up till now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The German-Austrian Mission in which the two archeologists E. Sellin
and C. Watzinger worked, was the first one to be interested in uncovering the antiguities
of Jericho, and that was in 1911. They were succeeded by the English, who conducted
excavations at Tall as-Sultan under the supervision of first J. Garstang ( 1930-1936 ) and
completed by Miss K. Kenyon ( 1952-1961 ). She published a resume of her work in two huge
volumes ( 1960-1965 ). She is considered to be the greatest authority on this subject. She
is the one to have estimated the age of the city to be 8000 years B.C. Its habitation
certainly started about that time which undoubtedly makes it the most ancient known city
in the world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">That is why it is probable that the most ancient civilization in the
world did not appear in the Nile Valley or the Tigris and Euphrates Valley, but in the
Jordan Valley. Dr. Kenyon gave the name of &quot; Ariha al-Ula &quot; ( The first Jericho
) to the first construction of the city which was sacked and destroyed as a result of
invasions, earthquakes and fire time and again. Every time it was destroyed it rose once
again on the ruins of the past Jericho. Kenyon and the archeologists who preceded her were
able to distinguish between the successive periods Jericho passed through.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Jericho in the Neolithic Times or the Late Stone Age Periods: <br>
These ages are divided into three parts:</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial" color="#408080">1. <a name="The pre-Stone Age">The pre-Stone
Age</a> or the first Neolithic Age in Jericho 6800 B.C. </font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">Miss Kenyon's excavations have revealed that the ancient city was
  inhabited during four successive intervals during this age. The first was the first
  Neolithic Time. In this it was inhabited by a folk called &quot; An-Natifiyyun &quot;, who
  depended for their food on collecting wild seeds. It is probable that they did not plant
  seeds in reality, but owned scythes with flint edges, straight bone handles to harvest
  wild seeds, and stone mortars with handles for grinding them. Some of these groups lived
  in caves, while other groups occupied primitive villages excelling in the art of
  architecture. So they started to build round huts from sun-dried bricks flat at the bottom
  curving at the higher edge. They used to bury their dead with their personal jewellery in
  graves hewn out of rock. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">These folks dug out canals using the waters of &quot; Ain as-Sultan
  to irrigate their lands. They constructed huge walls two metres wide round their villages.
  They erected in them a circular huge tower, nine metres ( thirty feet ) in diametre, and
  ten metres high. In its midst there are stairs leading from the bottom of the town to its
  top. They were exposed to the attacks of groups from outside. These folks practised
  agriculture, the domestication of animals, and weaving the making chains and mats, as well
  as animal hunting. They used spears and flint-capped arrows. They also used hatchets to
  cut tree branches. These groups had started to expand from their settlements in search of
  new homes outside their boundaries.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" color="#408080">2. <a name="The pre-Clay Age">The pre-Clay
Age</a> or the Second Neolithic Age in Jericho, 5500 B.C.</font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">The building of houses in this interval showed a great progress.
  Their rooms were about 6.5 metres by 5 metres or 3 by 7 metres. They were usually of a
  rectangular shape built in an open yard, seven metres long and seven metres wide and used
  for cooking. The thickness of their wall was half a metre. They used stones to build the
  foundation, and the rest of the building was built of sun-dried bricks. Its shape was
  similar to the iron used for cauterising animals. So the brick was rectangular in shape
  with sharpened edges. The floor formed was of a mud layer topped by a layer of lime,
  followed by soft lime dyed red or light blue. Then it was polished to acquire a new
  lustre.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Its houses were of one or two stories. The ceiling was built of
  reeds and mud. Their flint intensils were sharp-edged. Small statues were made of unbaked
  mud. In the past these statues possessed a religious significance. Female statues might
  indicate the fertility goddess. It seems that these folks practiced the worship of
  ancestors as nine skulls were found whose facial features were painted with lime with two
  mother-of-pearl eyes placed on their faces.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><font face="Arial" color="#408080">3. <a name="The Late Neolithic Age">The Late
Neolithic Age</a> in Jericho : between 5000-4000 B.C.</font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">This Age preceded by many centuries the discovery of pottery. The
  people who lived in this period were raiders coming from outside. They settled at Tall,
  and might have been nomadic Bedouins. Their looms have been found but their homes have
  disappeared. Jasper beads and pierced mother-of-pearl were found to be possessed by them.
  They buried their dead collectively in special vaults inside the city. They kept skulls in
  particular in the mausoleum of prominent men of their age. The lifespan of many of them is
  estimated, in the light of their remains to be 35 years. Few of them reached the age of
  50. This Age is divided into two periods:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The first Neolithic Pottery Age:<br>
  people in this age lived in pits. They worked in agriculture and in domesticating animals.
  They introduced the manufacture of pottery to their homes, but it was a primitive and
  rough one painted in red in geometrical figures.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The Second Neolithic Pottery Age:<br>
  People in this age were a great deal more advanced than their predecessors, as they lived
  in huts built of clay and manufactured earthenware in inclined lines.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial">Jericho in the Post Neolithic Age:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#408080"><strong><a name="The Bronze Age:">The Bronze Age:</a></strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">At the end of the Neolithic Age which was about the year 4000 B.C.,
a vacancy occurred in man's residence in Jericho and it became uninhabited for a certain
period of time. There are two different evidences to support this: the existence of an
accumulated layer of disintegrated organic matter over the Hill, part of which is
recognizable, and the absence of any remains from the age known as the Chalcolithic Age
which followed the Neolithic Age, and in which metals were used for the first time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The date of man's habitation on the Tall ( Hill ) can be traced back
to about 3200 B.C. The best illustration of this can be found in tombs. The main
cemeteries of old Jericho are found on the site on which the 'Aqapat Jabr refugee camp
stands from the northern part. Some graves were dug up in the streets and courtyards of
the camp. The most interesting of these graves is one which goes back to that age, as it
was found as a result of an examination by carbon number 14, that its history goes back to
3260 B.C. ± 110 years. That grave contained 113 skulls arranged round the tomb's chamber.
The center of the chamber contained a heap of burnt bones. Some of the skulls carried the
traces of scorching a heap of burnt bones. Some of the skulls carried the traces of
scorching but were not deliberately burnt. This indicates the existence of certain strange
customs in connection with burial rites. we also conclude that the bodies of the dead were
first placed in the open until the flesh was decomposed and separated from the bones. The
collecting of these numerous bone skeletons followed, with the skulls being symmetrically
arranged in a row round the tomb's chamber with their faces directed towards the inside.
The bones were heaped in the middle with the necessary inflammable material. Then it was
set on fire. When the heap cooled down after burning, the funeral offerings made mostly of
earthenware, were placed in the grave, while the burnt bones were covered by a layer of
stone chips. In reality, the other archeological discoveries in Palestine and Trans-Jordan
did not produce any evidence corroborating the existence on these customs, though the
custom of exposing bodies in the open, until the flesh disintegrated was not a custom
remote from what was familiar. We have nothing about those people except that they were
the pioneers of the following age, that is the First Bronze Age, which was the most
prosperous one in Jordan and Palestine. We see the features of the First Bronze Age, which
extends from 2900 B.C, evidently clear in Jericho especially with regard to defensive
fortifications in the town. These fortifications were, no doubt, supremely important. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The defensive walls were repaired and rebuilt sixteen times during
the First Bronze Age which lasted 600 years. It is often difficult to indicate the various
periods when the renewal of the building of the walls was made, as they used to fall down
as a result of earthquakes, or because of infiltration of water into their foundations,
and the people were prompt to repair them. Some destruction befell the walls as a result
of enemy attacks. In any case there appear on these walls during that period the traces of
destruction and ruin, but traces of repairs and renewed building are also apparent on
then. This goes to show that the inhabitants of the town lived a life devoid of security
and stability. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Nevertheless, the general picture shows a continuous improvement in
the fields of civilization and construction as people started to use copper in large
quantities in order to manufacture weapons and tools. Pottery utensils show an abundance
of trade exchange with all neighbouring valleys.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This period revealed a great progress in civilization, as it was
accompanied by the appearance of new towns in numerous sites that had been hitherto
uninhabited. But this civilization, along with other civilizations preceding it, crumbled
and came to an end at the hands of Bedouin raiders. It seems that the people at the end of
First Bronze Age started to enjoy a greater stability and tranquility leading to the
neglect of these defensive fortifications.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">But then came a time in which they woke up from their heedlessness
because the latest wall, dating back to that period reveals quick ill-contructed repairs
on the remains of a wall previously constructed. The foundation stones appear as if they
had been hurriedly dropped and with no organization. Then the wall started to be built of
baked brick moulds over the stones. Baked brick moulds used in other walls appear on this
wall. But calamity overtook those folks before they completed the construction of that
wall which was itself destroyed by fire, and the town fell into the hands of raiding
Bedouin tribes.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial" color="#408080"><a name="Intoduction">Intoduction</a></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After this date new inhabitants settled in Jericho. They resided
first on the top of the Hill. They built for themselves some ramshackle homes. The spread
of these homes stretched on the Hill slopes, as there was no defensive wall in that
interval. There is an edifice on the western side which may have been originally a temple,
as what resembles an altar was discovered together with the remains of a small animal
under its foundations. This period is known as marking the beginning of the Middle Bronze
Age. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In reality the tombs of those people attracted most attention,
contrary to the collective cemeteries where the dead used to be buried in previous ages.
They buried one dead person in every grave only placing with him some chattels and
jewellery. Graves stretching 248 metres from the original three hundred and sixty metres
were discovered at Tall A-Sultan. Some of these graves were very wide with the pit's width
being three metres and its depth five metres. The dimensions of the mausoleum chamber were
360, 330 and a height of 260 cms, which necessitated digging out 150 tons of rocks, and
all this was for the sake of burying one person. We can see that bodies were exposed until
the bones were stripped off before they were buried, as the folks who came before them
did. The objects placed inside the grave varied in accordance with the models of graves.
In some of them there was nothing save a dagger, in others pins and beads ( presumably
these belonged to women ). In some others some pottery utensils only were found, while in
other tombs a number of jars, a dagger or a spear head. Nevertheless all these had one
thing common namely the existence of a small niche hewn out of the wall of the mausoleum
chamber. It contained a four-headed lamp, the type which was prevalent in that period. It
appears that on the smooth surface of a rock of the corners of a grave that someone had
drawn some small pictures in the form of a goat or an ibex or a tree, in addition to two
men armed with spears and shields. This is, as we know, the only known illustration from
these people. Then earthenware utensils are not distinguished for accuracy and mastery,
having no adornment except for some circular lines which are colourless, and no paint of
any sort, a proof that they were only made then for utilitarian use without any interest
to decorate them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It is probable that these new inhabitants were no other than the
Amorites who occupied most of the Middle Eastern countries, including Iraq and Egypt,
during the period between 2300-1900 B.C. But they themselves were the victims of a greater
invasion by the Hyksos.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#408080"><strong><a name="The Hyksos:">The Hyksos:</a></strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Jericho was one of the strong-holds of the Hyksos or Shepherd Kings
1750-1580 B.C. as the Bible calls them. It is believed that they brought horses with them,
and perhaps the chariot, to Palestine and Egypt.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Their houses were well built and covered the whole top of the Hill.
Before their arrival the town was surrounded by a strong baked bricks, wall. They
introduced a brand new system of defensive fortifications, not to Jericho alone, but also
to all parts of Palestine. This new defensive system consisted of a steep earth slope
topped by a wall made of moulded baked bricks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The tombs of this period are generally characterized by being the
tombs of ancient people reused. One can see the grave chamber covered by a big stone, and
the opening filled with earth. It seems that the reason for the preservation of things in
good condition is accounted for by the infiltration of gases from cracks in the rock. They
were accumulated in the chamber eradicating moth and disintegration germs. Wooden tables,
baskets, seats, stuffing and artificial hairs, and even pieces of votive offerings' flesh
were found, all remaining in a good condition. All tombs were in the shape of collective
mausoleums. They used to accumulate the bone skeletons and first offerings in the corners
to leave room for the new dead. In the Palestine Archeological Museum in Jerusalem there
is one of these tombs, constructed in accordance with the condition in which it was in the
ancient times. Jericho was the third city in importance as its geographical situation had
the advantage of controlling the direct route with the lands rich in cereals in Trans
jordan. </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial" color="#408080"><a name="The Canaanites:">The Canaanites:</a></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial">These were among the folks that emigrated from Arabia to physical
Syria, and Jericho was one of their most important cities ( 1400 B.C. ). The name &quot;
Jericho &quot; to them meant &quot; the moon &quot;. Their houses were built near the site
of Al-'Ain where the fortress gate stood. The area of the city was six acres in their
time, and its walls reached a height of twenty one feet. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Their type of architecture followed this model : every building
consisted of one room having side doors and elevated platforms and was surrounded by
asphalted black soil. Their walls were built on the Babylonian style. The grandeur of
their buildings was evident from their monuments which included stone columns on both
banks of the Jordan River, from the inside of the Temple of Jericho, and from the
buildings erected round a courtyard in the middle of which there was a wide arched gate
which led into it. This Canaanite style still prevails in the Palestinian rural areas as
well as cities, and in the circular type of the architecture of the dome which appears in
the villages of 'Ain Malaha,' Ainat, Jericho and Wadi An-Nutuf. It is one of the most
prominent characteristics of Canaanite architecture. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Canaanites excelled in the sculpture of statues and in pictorial
sculpture which appears in the layers of gypsum covering the skulls, and which are similar
to a head cover. It is exactly similar to the contemporary head dress worn by Palestinian
women. It is known by its popular name, &quot;Al-Wiqahyah&quot; ( The protector ), or
&quot; As-Samada&quot; or &quot; Al- 'Usabh al-kan'aniyyah &quot;( The Canaanite Turban ).
Weaving looms, clothes, bedding, mats, tables, chairs, mineral pins for binding clothes
and for adornment were found.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Earthware manufacture was advanced with them. We find plates, jugs,
large copper basins, large water-jars pots and clay ovens (bread ovens that resemble those
of present villages ). Excavations disclosed numerous family mausoleums containing remains
of bodies next to which were found the traces of food, cooked or grilled mutton in
earthenware utensils, and the remains of cereals, pomegranates and raisins. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It is clear that the religious belief has become now more evident
and more refined than before as threefold statues were found in Jericho, which remind us
of the trinity in Canaanite worship, namely the Fertility God, the Fertility Goddess, and
the Enemy of the Fertility God. The statue of the Fertility Goddess was the statue of
Goddess ' Anat known in the texts of Agarith where she seizes her breasts in order to give
fertility and life to the land of the Canaanites. As far as the religious places are
concerned there is a temple in Jericho containing a niche. The plan of its architecture
was taken by the Jews in their synagogues. Then the Christians transferred it to their
churches, later it appeared in Islamic mosques. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Jericho did not reach this level of civilization alone, many cities
participated in it as ( Hazor-Na'anek and Megiddo ) on the northeast trade route, Shkeim,
Beirut and Jerusalem and others from the categories of Canaanite cities were like Jericho,
in progress, architecture, and power. The Bible described that when the Israelites said
about the Canaanites that they were &quot; a people stronger than they and of greater
stature with great cities pointing to heaven. You said to them : Do not fear them. God,
your lord who leads you fights for you.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Excavations at Salin revealed the remains of two Canaanite
fortresses, one of which rose on one of the seven hills on which Jericho was built. <br>
The fortress consisted of three stories reached by stairs to the towers which protected
it. Excavations revealed, too, the remnants of Canaanite walls built of baked bricks over
stone buttresses not fewer than three metres in width. Behind the wall there were
furnished houses containing oil jars and earthenware inscribed with drawings of lions and
gazelles. It was surrounded by fertile oases containing palm trees. That is why it is
called &quot; the city of palm trees &quot; in Deuteronomy and in Judges and in the books
of the Old Testament a lot is said about its prosperity brisk trade, numerous store shops,
warehouses, animals for transport and consumption, vessels and utensils made of copper,
iron, silver and gold.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#408080"><strong><a name="The Israelite Invasion:">The
Israelite Invasion:</a></strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">At the beginning of the thirteenth century B.C. the Israelites
invaded Palestine after their exodus from Egypt and several years in Sinai and in the
region of the northern Arabian Peninsula. They started by attacking Trans jordan where
they crossed the Jordan River Valley on foot coming from the hills of Moab on the ( East
Bank ). They pitched a camp at Abel Shetem whence they moved on Palestine under the
command of Joshua. Jericho was among the Palestinian cities which fell into their hands
after making for them from their camps which they had erected from clay and palm branches,
forty years after their exodus from Egypt. Priests bore the Arc of the Covenant and
compassed the city with it, headed by the seven priests, the trumpet-bearers, walking and
blowing the trumpets with those who were armed walking behind the Arc of the Covenant and
blowing their trumpets, and so they did once daily for six days. On the seventh day the
priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, &quot; Shout, for the lord hath
given you the city. And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to
the lord: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house,
because she hid the messengers that we sent Yoshah son of Nun Moses' boy and Calob son of
Yofnah - and it is said Kilab son of Yofnah, Moses' nephew. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In the Bible there is a horrible picture of the treatment by
Israelites of its inhabitants. we read in the Bible: &quot;... so that the people went up
into the city&quot; (that is Jericho) &quot;And they utterly destroyed all that was in the
city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the
sword, &quot;and they bunt the city with all that was in it, &quot;But all the silver, and
gold, and vessels of brass and iron are consecrated unto the Lord: they shall come into
the treasury of the Lord,&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Thus Jericho remained in this condition until it was repaired in the
reign of Ahab the son of Ouri who was one of the kings of Israel (874-852 B.C.) Hiel the
Bethelite fortified and repaired it four hundred years after its destruction There is a
reference to that in the Bible, namely that Joshna 's curse befell Hiel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#408080"><strong><a name="Jericho after the Israelites:">Jericho
after the Israelites:</a></strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It appears that Jericho flourished in Ruman times as is shown in the
remains of canals they dug and which can be seen at the River Kilt. In this period Jericho
started to export dates. Jericho acquired a great importance in the time of Christ (may
peace be upon him) as Jesus Christ Himself visited it and cured the eyes of two blind men,
Bartimoeus and his friend. While He was in it He visited Zacchaeus the publican in his
house. As Zacchaeus was of small statue he was forced to climb up a tree to see Jesus in
the crowd. Jesus walked along the caravan rout between Jericho and Jerusalem, which was
infested with thieves and highwaymen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In the reign of constantine the Great (306-337 A.D.), the founder of
constantinople, Christianity was spread in Jericho by monks and hermits who lived in
convents and churches which they constructed to become a centre for the propagation of
Christianity. In 325 A.D. it became the centre of a bishopric. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Roman Emperor Justinian (527-665 A.D.) constructed a church in
it. It was in his reign that a road was built joining it with Petra. The caravans used to
cross it in 3-4 days. Another road was built joining it with Bisan.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It appears that churches and convents became more numerous than they
were in the seventh century. Arco Levaux said that three was a church at Al-Juljal, and
another at the place where it is thought that Jesus took off His garment before His
baptism. Another church was built inside a large convent under the name of St. John. It
lies on a height overlooking the Jordan River.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Nevertheless this did not prevent the deterioration, neglect and
ruin that began to befall Jericho and the churches and convents round it, following the
diversion of the caravan route. The hermits' caves on the Mount of Temptation overlooking
the city, remained an indication of the lofty spirit of the early and medieval centuries.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Finally Jericho entered into the rule of the Arab who occupied these
countries in the seventh century A.D. In the dawn of Islam Jericho became the main city in
the Ghaur inhabited by a folk from Qais, as well as a group from Quraish. During the time
of the Prophet, may peace and prayer be upon him, he drove the Jews out of Madinah because
of their tyranny, and they left for Syria, Adhru'at and Jericho. 'Umar-Ibn-UL-Khattab may
God be satisfied with him - expelled the last of them in his reign from Hijaz to Taima'
and Jericho.</font></p>
