other ministries, so as to find solutions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Arab Development Society is the oldest continously operating
non-governmental organization ( NGO ) in Palestine. It was established in 1945 by a
resolution of the League of Arab States in support of a project proposed by Mr. Musa
Alami, the then elected spokesman of Palestinians both at the League and other fori. In
1952 ADS was re-registered under Jordanian law, and with the Palestinian Authority in
1996. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">ADS operates under a basic Charter and comprehensive internal rules
and regulations. It is a non-political, non-profit welfare society, primarily concerned
with serving rural Palestinian communities. Its main goals are : </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Raising the health and living standards of Arab rural communities. <br>
Improving artisanal and agro-industries. <br>
Enhancing environmental health through afforestation and commercial tree plantation. <br>
Encouraging cooperatives. <br>
Provision of free agricultural and industrial training to orphans and destitute Arab
youth. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">For many years, ADS's main welfare activity has been the education
and vocational training of Arab youth, the cost being partly financed from the income of a
2000-acre crop and dairy farm producing pasteurized milk and high quality youghurt and
soft and hard white cheeses. In addition, the farm offers opportunities for training in
poultry production, field and horticultural crops and agricultural machinery. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">While maintaining these activities ADS is currently widening the
scope of its work and has identified the following fields as suitable for its
intervention. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Cooperation with the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture and
Faculties of Agriculture and others in the way of offering them field facilities which
they now mostly lack. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Increasing milk production in rural areas by providing farmers with
high quality heifers from ADS herd through a scheme involving credit, milk collection,
artificial insemination and veterinary services. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Rural extension through the demonstration of improved farming
varieties and practices, initially on ADS farm, and elsewhere as opportunities arise. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The offer of certain facilities on the farm for community activities
including meetings, workshops and other cultural functions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">ADS welcomes any assistance it can receive from any source concerned
with the welfare of children in dire need. Contributions may be sent to : </font></p>
