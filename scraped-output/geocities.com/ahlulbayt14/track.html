<p><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A poem on Imam Husain (a)</font>
</p><p>* * * * * * *
</p><p>Trees I like them -
<br>In your reverence they stand firm;
<br>Likewise the water,
<br>It's the dowry of your mother.
<br>It's your blood brightened the honor,
<br>It's your nobility the horizon does mirror.
<br>The dusk is that niche,
<br>In the morn by martyrdom you did pray.
</p><p>In my mind thoughts about that valley flood
<br>The soil of which sucked your blood.
<br>No, indeed not, a vale so high I saw never.
<br>It is you, only you, in a downfall dear,
<br>Better from the vale itself hear!
</p><p>A sword which at your throat did ply
<br>Cut every thing into two under the sky.
<br>Turned Hussaini whatever at your side
<br>While Yazidi the other side.
<br>Now rocks and we!
<br>Waters and we!
<br>Hills, canals, meadows, trees-
<br>Some are Yazidis
<br>Else, they are Hussainis.
<br>Blood your neck irrigated
<br>Everything under the sky into two divided -
<br>Even the color
<br>Resided in every particle
<br>In a dazzling garish carbuncle.
<br>Else, not Hussaini nor does concur.
</p><p>Your death, lo, what a gage!
<br>Laughed at life and vilified its stage
<br>That to the death desired life to page.
<br>Your blood stood there
<br>and stood the Truth in its care:
<br>One it is but a fare.
<br>Determination stood a security;
<br>Riveted the world into its guarantee.
<br>Although false espouses the world
<br>Truth in canopy of your name brides the world.
</p><p>Peep into truth if to see you
<br>And the grass when it is to grow,
<br>The water in a drink when it's to flow,
<br>The stone as challenges a throw,
<br>Into a sword when it cuts into two
<br>Or the lion when its roar the winds blow,
<br>Into the horizon which is bloody,
<br>In the smile of dusk which is ruddy.
<br>In a stand,
<br>In a demand.
<br>You to be tound in crevices,
<br>To be smelled in roses
<br>And the burning sun to be demanded,
<br>The early morn to be commanded.
<br>Should be opened heart of the night,
<br>Seeds scattered the delight
<br>And the winds carry your sight;
<br>To be plucked from the bunches' height.
<br>In God alone you to be seen,
<br>Whosoever upon Truth if to lean,
<br>Gory is he and his fingers beam
<br>The glow of your blood and its sheen.
<br>Eternity is the mirror
<br>Hung before you for every viewer.
<br>Alas, the sun, it is no better;
<br>Hence, we wouldn't utter:
<br>'It is your looks' glitter.'
</p><p>In a cosy corner of history's conscience
<br>Guarding the Truth stands he is vigilance.
<br>In his smile tacts flow in mellifluence.
<br>Strong, straight. star striking-
<br>Such the determinations are demonstrating
<br>The elevations if to be viewed by a human being.
<br>Lo, infancy of reason astonishes in a daze confusing.
<br>It is the lake of your own blood-
<br>A gateway of history where you have stood
<br>Holding a jug of civilization tor human good
<br>To quench the caravan of mankind
<br>In a martyrdom pacing onward pressing the hind.
</p><p>Your name disturbs the sleep under moon
<br>And deluges in water a Typhon,
<br>Lo, rests the law in your tone.
<br>To battle your determination only fools prone,
<br>Your distinction is blood, only blood, blood alone.
<br>O, you, not a divine but in divinity drown.
<br>Death is vile in your hold
<br>As a fly a plaything among children's fold
<br>And Yazid, a pretext. an excuser if to be told,
<br>As though a handkerchief before you unrolled
<br>and you spited the filth of tyranny in its shroud
<br>and threw into the history's dustbin for other to scold.
<br>A huge blood sucker,
<br>Not an entity but a lier;
<br>Such was Yazid an idler.
<br>Sins personified in him
<br>And he to mankind a megrim.
<br>Robbery of name it is it to name him
<br>'A man' however the sense he claim.
<br>O, you! O, Glorious victim!
<br>Be upon you blessing!
<br>Not because thirsty you met martyrdom
<br>But your enemy is of such a sum.
</p><p>Your death red
<br>Broke Yazid's name into a shred,
<br>And made the sense in the word tyranny dead.
<br>Troops of words with barracks of description fled.
<br>Indeed, defeated is every human toil;
<br>Battle with you is foul and toil.
<br>Freed are the lions in your coil.
<br>Your blood overflows the expression's soil.
<br>Beyond the words is the flow for history's turmoil.
<br>Out of the track of time proceeds as a procession Royal.
<br>O, "Zabeehullah"! Divinity in your blood flows;
<br>You the "Ismayeel" of God, in you oneness glows.
<br>"Abraham's vision" from a dream reality barrows,
<br>Karbala where your appointment wallows,
<br>Moharram the hour of love when the love loves.
<br>And, lo, you are that sole person
<br>Carried forty days the pilgrim's season.
<br>"And We have complete it in ten"
<br>Ah, burns me the desire of comprehension;
<br>The incomplete pilgrimage pawned in suspension,
<br>Gained in your kiss at the dagger its perfection;
<br>For the "BLACK STONE" virtual the best compensation.&nbsp;
<br>Begins the love's history,
<br>The red gains its entity,
<br>From your death-to life a treaty.
</p><p>Letter commences from your blood
<br>Religion found way the time you stood
<br>As you fell the truth stood
<br>And took the Right a mould good.
<br>Weakened the tyranny's base in your blood's flood.
<br>Autumn of your death delivered eternal spring,
<br>Grass and trees in a pleasant ring,
<br>And a blossom of red at every branch to swing,
<br>Else, a dry fuelwood it is to the trees cling.
</p><p>Secret of death you have opened.
<br>No knot remained under your will's nail unopened.
<br>Wailing and weeping is the honor;
<br>You ahead and it entails you for ever.
<br>Beyond the manliness you are far and further.
<br>Prayers: you; intention: you;
<br>Oneness: you; and the one you;
<br>Oh, the verdure, the ever green'
<br>Oh, the red that frills the green
<br>Nobler than every pure and clean
<br>No human a parallel to you ever has been.
<br>O, sweet but staunch and staunch but sweet,
<br>Gapes wide history its mouth for you to spit.
<br>You an iron arm, you the scale of balance-
<br>You sense of the Book and you the Qur'an's essence.
<br>In your looks interpretation glow,
<br>And the paces to the earth dignity bestow.
<br>And become a gravity for galaxies on onward grow
<br>Divine verses lip and your lips utter-
<br>Wherever you be in you heavens glimmer.
<br>Wonder! Oh, wonder! you a wonder'
<br>My astonishment ends not if I to ponder
<br>Foolhardy it is to fathom oceans by a finger.
</p><p>Weep we-
<br>Gains your blood in our tears constancy
<br>Our tears a polish and sword in tendency
<br>Its seat is in the arena of tyranny.
<br>You are a Qur'an in red
<br>Verses of your bravery wrote the blood
<br>In the desert as far as the sands scud
<br>Those sands turned into a field-
<br>Rich in red bunches as a shield.
<br>Blood is the crop, blood is the yield
<br>Its every branch is a sword, a dagger
<br>Uproots the tyranny in the noon ot its summer.
<br>Hence, red is the field and shall he for ever.
</p><p>O, Tharallah!
<br>The garden of Eden; lo, what a mania!
<br>You planted in the burning desert of Karbala.
<br>With fruits red,
<br>Rivers bloody from bed to bed
<br>Buds to bloom martyrdom's red
<br>And trees in a row forming a green shade.
<br>Only loveful eyes see with looks in love fed.
<br>Akbar - you and in a quality bred;
<br>And the palm trees of consummate red.
</p><p>HUR - not a person but an attribute.
<br>At that side of the river to contribute:
<br>He parted the caravan and its plenitude.
<br>Bridges to a man your word, your look;
<br>Towards you he is in a hook
<br>As a food in a caravan for a cook.
<br>The brains in search of refuge
<br>Obtain from you light in a deluge.
<br>Desire for envy is a befitting subterfuge.
<br>HUR's bleeding head and your skirt - a fate profuse!
</p><p>Good is red after your martyrdom;
<br>Tears are daggers in your kingdom.
<br>Your pain is the pabulum
<br>For a journey - destination not datum
<br>The track of your blood is the way
<br>Terminates at the God's gateway.
<br>You are from the blood's strain
<br>And we in your love mad remain.
<br>Your blood sands were to sustain
<br>To gush from stones in a fountain.
<br>Oh, the fertile view-
<br>Tyranny has no enemy better than you,
<br>To a victim no acquaintance nearer than you.
<br>History gets brief in your class
<br>Hands do not meet at KARBALA's pause,
<br>Galaxy of Existence there heats the brass;
<br>The worship moves round it, solarium draws.
</p><p>Here the word ends,
<br>End too to end tends,
<br>At you no end bends.
