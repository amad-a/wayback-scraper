<p></p><center>List of some of the Jewish USA's Ambassadors </center></font>
<p></p><hr noshade="" width="76%">
<p>Germany: Ambassador John C. Kornblum </p><p align="justify">
Germany has long been seen as an adversary of the Jews. Thus a
Jewish Ambassador places them under direct Jewish pressure.</p><p>
France: Ambassador Felix Rohatyn  </p><p align="justify">
Rohatyn is a former partner in the Jewish Lazard Freres
investment bank. In September the French oil company, "Total,"
invested $2 billion in the production of oil in Iran. Rohatyn is
seeking to Veto this project due to Israel's hostility toward Iran. Rohatyn said; "Globalization doesn't carry a threat, but it carries discipline." </p><p>
Poland: Ambassador Daniel Fried   </p><p align="justify">
Chester Grabowski, editor of "The Polish Post Eagle", and others
urged Clinton to name a Polish American. This plea was ignored.
There has never been a Jew ambassador to Poland before as
Jews hold an animosity toward Poles. This is considered as a
gross insult. Regardless, Fried jokingly said: "I will now have to brush up on their language."      </p><p>
Denmark: Ambassador Edward E. Elson   </p><p align="justify">
Dr. Fields attended Marist High. School in Atlanta with the Elson
brothers. He learned that their family made a fortune in the textile business and are big contributors to the Democratic Party.  </p><p>
Hungary: Ambassador Donald M. Blinken  </p><p align="justify">
This country has long been considered "anti-Semitic". Budapest
has the largest Jewish population in Europe, some 125,000 Jews,
only exceeded by Paris Thus Blinken can protect their financial
interests.  </p><p>
Romania: Ambassador Alfred H. Moses     </p><p align="justify">
At one time Romania was ruled by an allJewish Communist Party
under Anna Pauka. Romania is closely allied with Israel. Six members of the Rumanian Senate, three of them priests,
objected to Clinton's 1994 appointment of Moses stating that he
was closely connected to the fallen Communist Ceausescu regime.  </p><p>
Belgium: Ambassador Alan J. Blinken    </p><p align="justify">
Antwerp, Belgium is the diamond capital of the world next to Tel
Aviv. The diamond business is totally Jew-controlled. Blinken is
in a position to further protect their interests. He is related to the Blinken ambassador to Hungary.    </p><p>
Belarus: Ambassador Kenneth S. Yalowitz   </p><p align="justify">
Belarus is located between Poland and Russia. It once had a huge
Jewish population.. They still have interests there.  </p><p>
South Africa: Ambassador James A. Joseph    </p><p align="justify">
The Jewish Oppenheimer family controls this gold mining capital
of the world. The Jewish-run South African Communist Party and
the ANC now control the government and loyally do the bidding
of the gold interests.)    </p><p>
India: Ambassador Frank G. Wisner   </p><p align="justify">
This economic powerhouse has long sided with the Arabs against
Israel and needs more Zionist control     </p><p>
Turkey: Ambassador Marc Grossman       </p><p align="justify">
The "Kemalist" Turkey is the only Middle East border country
with a military alliance with Israel. They pose a threat to Syria and Iraq over long simmering border disputes. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk was a secret Jewish infiltrator ! This explains the alliance between the Ataturk-influenced military regime in Turkey and the fraudulent and criminal state of Israel! This also explains the opposition of the "kémalian" junta against the rennaisance of Islam amongst the muslim people of Turkey! About the jewish Ataturk: visit the jewish home page "Famous Jews".</p><p>
New Zealand: Ambassador Josiah H. Beeman   </p><p>
Egypt: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer   </p><p align="justify">
Egypt is the recipient of the second largest amount of US foreign
aid. This is to "buy off" Israel's southern front. Any hostility
toward Israel would end the aid.)    </p><p>
Sweden: Ambassador Thomas L. Siebert  </p><p>
Morocco: Ambassador Marc C. Ginsberg   </p><p>
Singapore: Ambassador Timothy A. Chorba    </p><p>
Zambia: Ambassador Arlene Render   </p><p>
Brazil: Ambassador Melvyn Levitsky</p><p align="justify">
This is South America's largest country and economic
powerhouse. Jews have huge investments here.</p><p>
Bolivia: Ambassador Curt W. Kamman   </p><p>
This is another mineral rich country; copper, magnesium, lead, etc.</p><p>
Mexico: Ambassador Jeffrey Davidow   </p><p align="justify">
Davidow was formerly Assistant Secy. Of State for South America
under Albright. Mexico sends the US more immigrants and trade
than any other nation.  </p><p>
Canada: Ambassador Gordon Giffin    </p><p>
Thus Clinton has given both our border neighbors, Mexico and
Canada, to Jewish operatives.   </p><p>
Cuba: US Interest Head, Michael G. Kozak    </p><p>
One would think that this nation would have a Spanish Catholi
"Interest Chief" instead of a Jew??? </p><p>
Norway: Ambassador David B. Hermelin </p><p align="justify">
Hermelin is a Michigan multi-millionaire real estate developer and president of the World Jewish ORT Union. Re owns Palace Sports and Entertainment, "The Palace" of Auburn Hills and the "Pine Knob Music Theater".  </p><p>
Switzerland: Ambassador Madeleine M. Kunin </p><p align="justify">
Kunin is the former Democratic governor of Vermont. Her four
children attended a Hebrew school. The New York Times of Oct.
4, 1997 says she, "doggedly pursues the Swiss on the issue of
gold for holocaust survivors."
