<h2 align="center">I ASKED FOR ......</h2>
<p>* I asked for Strength ......
</p><p>And Allah gave me Difficulties to make me strong.
</p><p>* I asked for Wisdom ......
</p><p>And Allah gave me Problems to solve.
</p><p>* I asked for Prosperity ......
</p><p>And Allah gave me Brain and Brawn to work.
</p><p>* I asked for Courage ......
</p><p>And Allah gave me Danger to overcome.
</p><p>* I asked for Love ......
</p><p>And Allah gave me Troubled people to help.
</p><p>* I asked for Favors .......
</p><p>And Allah gave me Oppurtunities.
</p><p>I received nothing I wanted,
</p><p>I received everything I needed,
</p><p>My Prayer has been answered.
</p><h2 align="center">----------------------------------------</h2>
<h2 align="center">TIME</h2>
<p>To realize the value of one year, ask the student who failed a grade. 
</p><p>To realize the value of one month, ask the mother who gave birth to a premature baby. 
</p><p>To realize the value of one day, ask the editor of a daily newspaper. 
</p><p>To realize the value of one hour, ask the bride waiting to be wed. 
</p><p>To realize the value of one minute, ask the man who just missed the train. 
</p><p>To realize the value of one second, ask the person who just avoided an accident. 
</p><p>To realize the value of one milli-second, ask the Olympian who qualified for a bronze. 
</p><p>Treat every day as your last. 
</p><p>Treasure every moment that you have. 
</p><p>And treasure it more because you shared it with someone special, special enough to
</p><p>share your time with. 
</p><p>And remember that time waits for no one. 
</p><p>Today is history. 
</p><p>Tomorrow is a mystery. 
</p><p>Today is a gift. 
</p><p>The gift of life. 
</p><h2 align="center">----------------------------------------</h2>
<h2 align="center">Funny Isn't it?</h2>
<p align="justify">"Funny how $10 looks so big when we take it to the masjid and so small when we take it to the store."
</p><p align="justify">"Funny how long an hour serving God looks and how short 60 minutes are when spent playing golf, fishing or playing soccer."
</p><p align="justify">"Funny how laborious it is to read a juzuk in the Quran and how  easy it is to read 2 to 300 pages of a best selling novel."
</p><p align="justify">"Funny how we believe what the newspapers say but question what the Quran says."
</p><p align="justify">"Funny how we can't think of anything to say when we pray and don't have any difficulty thinking of things to talk to a friend."
</p><p align="justify">"Funny how we need a long time and have difficulties to memorize one or two verses of Al-Quran, but a very short time and easy to memorize song."
</p><p align="justify">"Funny how we can face the TV for hours yet we cannot face the Qibla for 10 minutes."
</p><p>"Funny isn't it...?"
</p><h2 align="center">----------------------------------------</h2>
<h2 align="center">You</h2>
<p>You Know Allah (swt)
</p><p>Yet you do not obey Him,
</p><p>You recite the Quran,
</p><p>Yet you do not act according to it,
</p><p>You know Satan,
</p><p>Yet you have agreed with him,
</p><p>You proclaim your love for paradise,
</p><p>Yet you do not act to gain it,
</p><p>You proclaim your fear for the fire,
</p><p>Yet you do not prevent yourselves from sins,
</p><p>You say "indeed death is true",
</p><p>Yet you have not prepared for it,
</p><p>You busy yourselves with finding faults with other,
</p><p>Yet you do not look at your own faults,
</p><p>You eat that which Allah (swt) has provided for you,
</p><p>Yet you do not thank Him,
</p><p>You bury your dead,
</p><p>Yet you do not take lesson from it.
