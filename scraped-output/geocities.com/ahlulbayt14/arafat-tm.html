<h3>Arafat's tourism ministry to organize nudity contest</h3>
<p></p><hr size="1" width="75%">

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Occupied Jerusalem- The Palestinian Authority's tourism ministry announced
it would organize this summer a nudity contest under the rubric of a "beauty
queen contest." 
</p><p align="justify">The Semi-official Palestinian press today featured large advertisements to
that effect, inviting Palestinian girls to take part in the contest to register their
names from July 20 to August 10. 
</p><p align="justify">Palestinian sources said the contest to choose Miss Palestine would coincide
with preparations to declare Palestinian statehood in September. 
</p><p align="justify">The newspaper al-Ayyam featured a topless girl in its add, emblazoned with
the phrase "take part in the Miss Palestine contest now." 
</p><p align="justify">A spokesman for the organizers of the contest said the participants would
eventually be asked to wear "swim suits", and would represent Palestine in
the Miss-World contest. 
</p><p align="justify">Asked if he was worried about possible reactions from Islamic and
conservative circles who view this kind of activity as a form of promiscuity, the
spokesman said "the PA will provide protection for our activities." 
</p><p align="justify">Since its installment more than six years ago, Arafat's regime has sought to
encourage many negative western lifestyles, such as drinking of alcoholic
beverages, gambling, and even prostitution.
