There was a time in my youth,<br>
When Islam was only a custom.<br>
They said "say La IIaha IIIa Allah,..<br>
And pray, you'll go to Heaven."<p></p>
<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>
Ah, how simple,<br>
No struggle in this,<br>
Just a word, and simple act.<br>
Thereafter I'm absolved in this world,<br>
With my 'assured' place in Paradise intact.</p>
<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>
But this was not to be my fate<br>
For ALLAH chose to guide my heart.<br>
I learnt of a man who struggled so hard<br>
When his mission was difficult from the start.</p>
<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>
The story of someone who had morals,<br>
Spoke gently, kindness as he knew.<br>
Never fearing to say what is right,<br>
His conviction in ISLAM was true.</p>
<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>
The touch of his hand was as soft as silk<br>
To comfort the crying child.  To mend his clothes,<br>
or do the chores, Never complaining, he always smiled.</p>
<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>
A living he made with his bare hands,<br>
The same that held his mighty sword.<br>
Valour shone from the edge of his blade,<br>
Every heart and soul he adored.</p>
<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>
His smell was always of musk,<br>
And cleanliness he kept at his best.<br>
Stark contrast with the heroes of today,<br>
Who stink of beer and sweat.</p>
<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>
He held the hands of his companions.<br>
Unashamed to play with small children.<br>
So modest, so humble, a perfect example,<br>
That even a stranger could recognise him.</p>
<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>
His eyes slept very little,<br>
For nights were precious,<br>
His prayers he treasured much greater.<br>
To wake and pray in the depths of night,<br>
Seeking forgiveness, and being nearness his Creator.</p>
<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>
He broke his tooth for me at Uhud,<br>
And bled for me at Ta'if.<br>
He cried for me, tears of concern,<br>
Just so I could have this belief.</p>
<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>
His enemies admired his teachings,<br>
Uniting every religion, every clan.<br>
Till ISLAM came to every corner of the world,<br>
Yet, indeed, he was only a man.</p>
<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>
To own a house, or build his wealth<br>
Was not his main priority.<br>
To establish ISLAM was more essential,<br>
To bring us under a Higher Authority.</p>
<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>
Don't you want him to plea for your case,<br>
When before ALLAH, The Judge, you stand?<br>
Don't you wish to be around his fountain,<br>
A burning desire to drink from his hand?</p>
<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>
So love him more than all creation,<br>
Our Leader, OUR Humble Prophet.<br>
Muhammad (SAWW) was a mercy to all mankind,<br>
And to me, he is MY BELOVED !<br>
Salawaat ala Muhammad wa ale Muhammad
