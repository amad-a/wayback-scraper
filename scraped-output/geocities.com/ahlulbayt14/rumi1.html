Knock, and he'll open the door.<br>
Vanish, and he'll make you shine like the sun.<br>
Fall, and he'll raise you to the heavens.<br>
Become nothing, and he'll turn you into everything. <br><br>
<center><b>* * * * * </b></center><br>                           
From myself, I am copper,<br>
Through you, friend, I am gold;<br>
From myself I am a stone,<br>
But through you I am a gem. <br><br>
<center><b>* * * * * </b></center><br>
Don't treat me as a stranger <br>
I am your neighbor.<br>
My house is close to yours.<br>
I may look different, by my heart is good.<br>
My inside is shining even if my sayings are obscure.<br><br>
<center><b>* * * * * </b></center><br>
There is a Soul inside your Soul.<br>
Search that Soul.<br>
There is a jewel in the mountain of body.<br>
Look for the mine of that jewel.<br>
Oh, Sufi, passing by,<br>
Search inside if you can, not outside.<br><br>
<center><b>* * * * * </b></center><br>
Oh reason, go away.<br>
There is no wise one here.<br>
Even if you become a small hair.<br>
There is no place for you.<br>
It is morning now.<br>
Whatever candle you <br>burn
Would be shamed in front of sunshine.<br><br>
<center><b>* * * * * </b></center><br>
Love asked me last night, with pity,<br>
"How could you live without Me?"<br>
"I swear," I said,<br>
"I am like a fish out of water."<br>
"It is your fault," he answered.<br>
"You are the one fleeing from Me.<br><br>
<center><b>* * * * * </b></center><br>
Last night I asked an old wise man<br>
To tell me all the secrets of the universe.<br>
He murmured slowly in my ear,<br>
"This cannot be told, but only learned."<br><br>
<center><b>* * * * * </b></center><br>
I am a soul who has had<br>
A hundred thousand bodies.<br>
But I can't talk about it.<br>
What can I do?<br>
I am tongue-tied.<br>
I have seen thousands<br>
Of people who were all me.<br>
But from them I haven't found <br>
Any like me.<br><br>
<center><b>* * * * * </b></center><br>
At the dawn of Eternal Love<br>
Souls fly out of bodies<br>
And man reaches the stage of perception<br>
Where with every breath<br>
He can see and touch<br>
Without eyes and without hands.<br><br>
<center><b>* * * * * </b></center><br>
How long am I going to tell<br>
The color and smell of time?<br>
It must be time to see that Beauty.<br>
When I look at Him I see myself,<br>
And when I look at myself, I see Him.<br><br>
<center><b>* * * * * </b></center><br>
Come again, please, come again,<br>
Whover you are.<br>
Religious, infidel, heretic or pagan.<br>
Even if you promised a hundred times<br>
And a hundred times you broke your promise,<br>
This door is not the door<br>
Of hopelessness and frustration.<br>
This door is open for everybody.<br>
Come, come as you are<br><br>
<center><b>* * * * * </b></center><br>
I am a river.<br>
You are my sun.<br>
You are the medicine<br>
Of my broken heart.<br>
I fly behind You, windless.<br>
I am a needle.<br>
You are my magnet.<br><br>
<center><b>* * * * * </b></center><br>
I picked the rose in a hurry.<br>
I was afraid of the Gardener.<br>
Then I heard the soft voice of Him,<br>
"What's the value of one rose?<br>
I give you the whole garden."<br><br>
<center><b>* * * * * </b></center><br>
I cannot sleep when I am with you<br>
Because of your love.<br>
I cannot sleep without you<br>
Because of my screaming and yelling.<br>
I am awake on both night,<br>
But what a difference in between.<br><br>
<center><b>* * * * * </b></center><br>
You are the water.<br>
We are the plants.<br>
You are teh King.<br>
We are the poor.<br>
You are the one who talks.<br>
We are the echoes.<br>
You are the one searching.<br>
Why don't you come to all of us once?<br><br>
<center><b>* * * * * </b></center><br>
"I'll fly like a pigeon from your hand."<br>
"If you fly, you deserve to be<br>
Chained with my grief," he answered.<br>
I said, "I am tired and weak,<br>
Dying from your love."<br>
"Death would be an honor for you," he said,<br>
"If you die with My love."<br><br>
<center><b>* * * * * </b></center><br>
I see an eye in every fortune,<br>
And a fortune sits in every eye.<br>
Oh, cross-eyed one,<br>
If you see two in one,<br>
I only see one in two.<br><br>
