</p><p></p><hr size="1"><p>
</p><h2 align="center">PALESTINE AND AL-QUDS</h2><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><ul>
<li><p align="justify">Jerusalem is the first Kiblah of Muslims and it belongs to them. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">All
must know that the superpowers aim in creating Israel does not end in the
occupation of Palestine. They plan, Heaven forbid, to extend the fate of Palestine to all Arab countries. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Do not
the authorities of the nation see or know that diplomatic talks with history's
criminal and powerful politicians cannot save Lebanon, Palestine or Quds
and the number of crimes and oppressions increases daily. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We are on the side of the oppressed which-ever pole they may be in. Palestinians
are oppressed by the Israelites, therefore we side with them. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We fully support our Palestinian brothers and those of southern Lebanon in their
fights against the usurper Israel. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Neither the Iranian Muslim nation, nor any other Muslims and, as a matter of fact,
no open-minded individual, will recognize Israel. We shall always support
our Arab and Palestinian brothers. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We must all rise, destroy Israel and replace it with the heroic Palestinian nation.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The Quds Day which is coincidental with the Night of Destiny (Lailatul-Qadr) must be revived among the Muslims and be the starting point of their awakening and awareness.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Muslims of the world should regard the Quds Day as All-Muslims Day or the oppressed People's Day. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">It is
the intonation of Allah-o-Akbar, the cry of our nation, that disappointed
the Shah in Iran and the usurpers in Palestine. Essentially, it is the
duty of all Muslims to liberate the Quds and remove this nucleus of evil
from Islamic lands. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
issue of Quds is not a private or personal issue. It is not the exclusive
problem of one country nor a present-day problem of all Muslims. Rather,
it is a phenomenon concerning the monotheists and faithful people of all
ages-past, present and future. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Quds
belongs to the Muslims and must be returned to them. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
Quds Day is the Day of Islam. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
Quds Day is a day in which the destinies of the oppressed nations must
to determined. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
Quds Day is a universal day. It is not an exclusive day for Quds itself.
It is a day for the oppressed to rise and stand up against the arrogant.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The Quds Day is a day in which Islam is to be revived. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The Quds Day is Islam's Live Day! 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
Quds Day which fall on the last days of the God's Great Month (Ramadan)
is a proper day on which all Muslims be freed from the bondage of the Big
Satan (Great Devil, USA) and other superpowers and join the Infinite Might of God. 
</p></li></ul><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><h2 align="center">
THE QUDS OCCUPATIONIST REGIME (ISRAEL)</h2><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><ul>
<li><p align="justify">I regard
supporting the plan for independence of Israel and its recognition a tragedy
for the Muslims and an explosion for the Islamic governments. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
usurper state of Israel with the aims it has pose great danger to Islam
and the Islamic states. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Brothers
and sisters must know that America and Israel are enemies to the fundamentals
of Islam. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
foolish idea of greater Israel makes them commit any crime. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Let
brotherly Arab nations and the Palestinian and Lebanese brothers know that
all their miseries are caused by America and Israel. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Regarding
Israel, certainly we shall not help an illegitimate, usurper government
which is trespassing the rights of the Muslims and is an enemy of Islam.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Islam
and the Muslims and all international standards regard Israel as a usurper
and aggressor and we do not approve the least negligence in terminating
its aggressions. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">I have
often said and you have heard me say that Israel will not settle for these
agreements for it regards the Arab domination over territories from the
Nile to the Euphrates as usurpation. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Israel
must be eradicated from the page of history. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">It is
incumbent on every Muslim to arm himself against Israel. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Those
who support Israel must realize they are nurturing a pit viper up their
sleeves. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Do not
support Israel, this enemy of Islam and Arabs for this listless viper will
have no mercy on you, young or old if it gets within your reach. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">It is
necessary that all freedom-loving peoples of the world unite with the Muslims
and together condemn the inhuman aggressions of Israel. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Iran
has been and is the diehard enemy of Israel. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We shall
reject Israel and shall have no relations with it for it is a usurper state
and is our enemy. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">I announce
to all Islamic states and Muslims of the world, wherever they are, that
the dear Shiite nation hates Israel and its agents and is disgusted with
and hates the states that compromise with Israel. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We shall
not have relations with Israel as it is a usurper state and is warring
against Muslims. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We shall
oppose Israel for it has usurped the rights of Arab peoples. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Israel
is warring against Muslims, and usurps the lands of our brothers, we shall
not give it any oil. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Israel
is rejected by us, we shall never give it oil nor ever recognize it. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
criminal hands of the world arrogant states will not be severed off the
Islamic lands unless Muslim nations and oppressed peoples rise against
them and their offsprings especially Israel. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Israel
is a usurper and must leave Palestine soon and the way to it is that Palestinian
brothers uproot this core of corruption and colonialization from the region
so that peace may return to the area. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">It is
a duty of the proud nation of Iran to harness the interests of America
and Israel in Iran and invade them. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">It is
necessary for oil producing Islamic countries to use the oil and other
things available to them as weapons against Israel and the colonisers.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">It is
incumbent on all Muslims especially Muslim countries to do away with this
core of corruption any way possible. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">This
degenerative tumour that has, with backing of major powers, been planted
in the heart of Islamic states and whose roots daily threaten the Islamic
lands must be removed with help and effort of Islamic states and the great
nations of Islam. 
</p></li></ul><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><h2 align="center">THE ARROGANTS AND THE SUPERPOWERS</h2><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><ul>
<li><p align="justify">We would
surely destroy all arrogant powers if we could have the power to do it.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
peace and safety of the world is keyed to the extinction of the arrogant.
As long as these domineering, uncultured group exist on earth, the oppressed
will not gain the inheritance that Almighty God has granted them. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Of all
the blows meted out on us by the big powers, the blow to our personality
is the worst. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Today
world conditions are so that all countries are under political supervision
of the superpowers. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">All
the troubles in which nations are bogged down are caused by superpowers.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
whole aim of these criminals is to gain power, power with which to clobbers
anyone that stops in their path. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">It is
incumbent on the intellectuals to reveal the disgrace of the powers and
superpowers, all the more. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Let
all know that the powerful, opportunistic countries whose ultimate wish
is to dominate the Islamic and oppressed countries will leave them alone
and abandon them in times of trouble, that the words faith or fidelity
do not appear in their lexicons. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Unite,
for under the aegis of unity your victory will be certain. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Rights
are to be taken, arise and drive out the superpowers from the scene of
history and life. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">World
powers must know that today is not like yesterday. Unlike the governments,
the nations will not retreat from the arena with just one short tirade
of intimidation. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We have
no fear of the superpowers. While we have no access to man-slaughtering
weapons, our faith impels us not to be afraid. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
aim is just one-the defeat of the superpowers. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">It is
our duty to stand and oppose the superpowers and we have the power to do
so. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We are
so suspicious of the superpowers that if they speak the truth we think
that they say so to deceive the people. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Today,
all superpowers collectively oppose this nation in all its Islamic aspects.
We must wake up and realize that their propaganda is more harmful to us
than wars. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
basic purpose of colonizing governments is to wipe out the Quran, the ulema
and Islam itself. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">That
day is blissful to us in which the domination of worldmongers over this
oppressed nation and over other oppressed nations is smashed and all nations
take their destinies in their own hands. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
slap-in-the face which the superpowers received from Iran, was matchless
in all their lives. 
</p></li></ul><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><h2 align="center">NATURE OF THE USA GOVERNMENT</h2><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><ul>
<li><p align="justify">We have
been hurt more by America than by all others. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">American
domination carries with it the entire miseries of the oppressed nations.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">America
is the number-one-enemy of the oppressed and deprived peoples of the world.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">America
says 'we have interests in the Region.' Why should it have interests in
our Region and why should the interests of the Muslims belong to America!?
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Muslim
nations hate foreigners generally, Americans, especially. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Let
the world know that any trouble that Iranian nation and Muslim nations
have is caused by foreigners, by America. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
most important and painful problem that Islamic nations and non-Islamic
nations of the dominated states face concerns America. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">All
of our distresses are caused by America. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Our
entire misery is by the hand of America. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">America
wants you for your oil, wants you as a market, to take away the oil and
sell you junk! 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
real enemies of the Quran, Islam and its holy Prophet (SAW) are the superpowers,
especially America. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">America,
this natural criminal that has set the world on fire and its colleague,
world Zionism, to reach their objectives commit crimes that pens and tongues
are ashamed to describe. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Our
entire troubles come from America and Israel. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Let
the president of America realize that he is the most hateful individual
to our nation. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
feelings of the Iranian nation concern American government, not American
nation. 
</p></li></ul><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><h2 align="center">FIGHTING AMERICA</h2><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><ul>
<li><p align="justify">Shower
all your cries down on America. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Today,
America is the number one enemy of our whole nation. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Cold
and warm weapons, that is , pens, words and machineguns should all be aimed
at the enemies of mankind, headed by America. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We believe
Muslims should unite and together slap America and know that they can do
it! 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We do
not want America to work for us, we override America. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">If opposition
to America implies independence of that country, then, by all means, we
are opposed to it and if this point is what America is afraid of, then
let it remain afraid. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Our
common enemies today are Israel and America and others like them. They
want to destroy our prestige and put us back in bondage. Repel the common
enemies! 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
stigma that this Movement inflicted on America has never been experienced
by any one. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Our
crime is that we oppose America. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Much
better we all perish than live in misery under American or Israeli hands.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">O oppressed
peoples of the world! Wherever you are and from whatever group or layer
you come from, arise and do not fear the yelling and ruckus of America
and other powers and make the world too narrow and tight for them. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">America
cannot act as a swaggerer before the Muslims. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">America
can't do a damn! 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
fight, the dispute now going on is not America and us, it is between Islam
and paganism. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Counteracting
America is presently above all our problems. If today our forces become
divided, it benefits America. Right now, America is the enemy and all our
equipments should be aimed at this enemy. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Our
perfect happiness comes the day when the domination of all the Eastern
and Western colonisers, especially that of worldmongering America is removed
from the heads of the Muslims. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">America
can defeat us but not our Revolution. for this reason I am confident of
our victory. American government does not understand the concept of martyrdom.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">I am
confident if we carefully perform and continue our duty which is to fight
the criminal America, our children shall taste the sweet nectar of martyrdom.
</p></li></ul><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><h2 align="center">RELATIONS WITH THIE USA</h2><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><ul>
<li><p align="justify">Our
relation with America is the relations of the oppressed to the oppressor,
relations of a robbed person to his robber. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We are
not a protectorate of America or Soviet Union nor of any other power. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">May
God awaken those who dream of America. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
day America praises us that day we must mourn. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We do
not want America to supervise us. We do not want America to take away the
entire gains of our nations. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">It is
a disgrace for a Muslim country to extend a band to America and ask for
bread. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We shall
not establish relations with America unless it became humane and give up
oppressing others. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We will
establish relations with America and the USSR provided they do not interfere
in our domestic affairs and have good relations with us. 
</p></li></ul><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><h2 align="center">THE WEST AND WESTERNIZATION</h2><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><ul>
<li><p align="justify">By autosuggestion
we must realize that nothing goes on in the West except the idea of keeping
us behind from the caravan of progress and civilization. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We accept
the advancements of the Western world but not the Western corruption of
which they themselves complain. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
progress of the West is materialistic, it rears the world as a wild fighting
beast. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Western
upbringing or education has divested mankind of his humanism. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We have
come to believe that everything is in the West. No! That which is in the
West is the training of savage animals. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We can't
be independent, we can't have anything unless we purge our minds of westernization
and come to know ourselves. 
</p></li></ul><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><h2 align="center">THE ORIENT</h2><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><ul>
<li><p align="justify">The
Orient has lost itself It has to find itself 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
Orient must wake up and separate its account from the West as far as it
can if possible to the end, at least separate its culture. 
</p></li></ul><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><h2 align="center">COMMUNISM</h2><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><ul>
<li><p align="justify">From
its inception, Communism has had the most dictatorial governments, its
authorities have been most dictatorial, power-hungry and monopolistic persons.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">It is
clear to all that from now on communism may be looked up in the museums
of World's political history.
</p></li></ul><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><h2 align="center">INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS</h2><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><ul>
<li><p align="justify">We are
in an age when criminals are praised and confirmed rather than being punished.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">These
so-called human rights agencies condemn the oppressed rather than the oppressors.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">These
agencies that are created for human rights, are all agencies for pilfering
mankind. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">They
commit so much crime, they turn countries into grounds for massacre and
bloodshed yet they claim: 'we cannot see human rights destroyed!' 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We want
to act according to the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights. We want to be
free. We want independence in our country. We want freedom. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">This,
and any other, nation has a right to determine its destiny itself This
is a human right and it is embodied in the Human Rights Declaration. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">These
(states) speak of human rights but act against it. Islam both respects
and observes human rights.
</p></li></ul><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><h2 align="center">FOREIGN POLICY</h2><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><ul>
<li><p align="justify">While maintaining independence, we shall have friendly relation with all countries.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We are
on friendly terms with all nations and, if governments behave respectfully,
we shall reciprocate in kind. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
foreign policy of Iran is based in mutual respect with all governments
without discriminating among them. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We shall
behave with respect toward all governments provided they do not interfere
in our internal affairs and treat us with mutual respect. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We should
have relations with foreign countries which do not mean to swallow us.
Relations with those who seek to subordinate us through relations are not
required and these must be dealt with caution. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We are
on the side of the oppressed. We support the oppressed regardless of the
pole they are in. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We have
the duty of saving the oppressed and deprived people. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">It is
an Islamic duty incumbent on all Muslims to help anyone who is oppressed.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We have
a duty to support the oppressed and be enemy to the oppressor. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We are
opposed to any deal that damages the interests of the Muslims. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">When
we serve the nation, the nation will support us and then foreigners' greed
ceases.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We are
not opposed to nations, we oppose oppressive governments whether they oppress
us or our Muslim brothers. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We are
not prepared to let a government use economic exchanges as levers for political
influence and imposition of its colonialization aims. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">World
conditions no longer admit a few to be "masters" and all others
to be "slaves". 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Just
as we do not accept oppression in our relations with other countries, we
do not oppress others. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Relationships
between a nation that has risen to free itself from the clutches of International
pilferers and a worldmonger is always in the interest of the pilferer and
the loss of the oppressed. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We oppose
any country, whether Eastern or Western, that wants to oppress others.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Today
the only non-aligned country is Iran. You cannot find another country that
is 'non-aligned in the real sense". 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Destroy
anyone in any position who may want to compromise with the East or the
West, drive him away as ruthlessly as you can. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Defence
of Islam and the Hizbullah (Party of God) is the unimpeachable principle
of the policies of the Islamic Republic. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We cannot
separate our own account from that of other Muslims. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Care
for the affairs of Muslims is a most necessary duty. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Tending
to the affairs of Muslims is a very important religious duty. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">We hope
that the Islamic nations will overcome colonialization in near future,
we shall not spare any assistance when due. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Our
state is an independent sovereign state, and we are on friendly terms with
those states that do not interfere in our domestic business. 
</p></li></ul>
<p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><h2 align="center">MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND THE EMBASSIES</h2><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><ul>
<li><p align="justify">The
Foreign Ministry can, by Islamization, better than any other agent, demonstrate
our Islamic substance to people abroad. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">This
Ministry, that has to do with all other countries of the world, is more
sensitive than any other ministry.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
responsibility of Foreign Ministry is very heavy because of its dealings
abroad therefore, try, as much as possible, to place your embassies in
the path of Islamic growth, progress and advancement to high status. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">When
people come to our embassies, they should see an Iranian setting not an
American or French environ. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">If embassy
conditions, its staff, its management and attitudes be not in conformity
with standards of the Islamic Republic, it is better not to have them.
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Our
embassies must be centers of publicity. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The
representatives of the Islamic Republic abroad must perfectly conform to
Islamic Order. 
</p></li></ul><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><h2 align="center">GOVERNMENTS OF ISLAMIC STATES</h2><p></p><hr size="1"><p></p><ul>
<li><p align="justify">The
misfortunes of the Islamic states is caused by interference of foreigners
in their affairs. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">Regional
governments must know that in time of trouble neither America nor any other
power will support them. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">For
more than 20 years past I have been recommending to the heads of Islamic
states, either in my sermons or talks, to put aside the minor local disputes
and unite in deeds and minds for advancement of Islam and its aims. 
</p></li><li><p align="justify">The problem of Islam is its Islamic governments not its nations.
