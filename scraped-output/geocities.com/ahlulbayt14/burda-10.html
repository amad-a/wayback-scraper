<p>Is it because of your remembrance of the neighbours of Dhi-salam.
</p><p>That tears mixed with blood are flowing (from your eyes).
</p><p>Or is it because of the breeze blowing from Kaazimah.
</p><p>Or it is the lightning struck in the darkness of the night Idam
</p><p>What has happened to your eyes, (the more) you tell them to stop, the more they continue flowing.
</p><p>What is the matter  with your heart, (the more) you tell it to come to its senses, (the more it is distracted).
</p><p>Does the lover think that his love can be concealed.
</p><p>While his eyes are shedding tears and his heart is glowing.
</p><p>Had it not been for the love, you would not have shed tears at the ruins (of your beloved).
</p><p>Nor would you become restless at the remembrance of the cypress (tree) the high mountain.
</p><p>How do you deny love after the testimony.
</p><p>Borne against you by (such) reliable witnesses as your yours and your illness.
</p><p>Love has ingrained two lines of fear, and withered your face.
</p><p>On your cheeks like yellow rose and the reddish tree.
</p><p>Yes! Thoughts of the beloved came to me at night and kept me awake.
</p><p>And love transforms pleasure into pain.
</p><p>O you  who reproach me, regarding my love, excuse me.
</p><p>From me to you if you do justice, you would not reproach me.
</p><p>My state (of love) has been expressed to you, (now) my secret is no longer concealed.
</p><p>From those who malign (me), nor is there (something to) check my agony.
</p><p>You have sincerely advised me , I did not heed it.
</p><p>For verily a lover is deaf to those who advise him.
</p><p>I regarded with suspicion the advice of the elders in reproaching me.
</p><p>(Wisdom) in the advice of the elders is above suspicion.
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="60%"><p>
</p><p>Verily  my soul which is laden evil did not heed the advice.
</p><p>And I have not prepared, for good deeds, a feast,
</p><p>Due to its ignorance, from the warning by grey hair and old age.
</p><p>For a guest (that) has lodged on (my) head nor did I honour  (him).
</p><p>Had I known that I would not be able to honour him (it).
</p><p>I would have concealed my secret, which is exposed, by dyeing.
</p><p>Who is there that can restrain my wayward-self from its waywardness.
</p><p>Just as unmanageable horses are restrained by resins.
</p><p>Do not try, through sinning, to subdue sensual desires.
</p><p>For verily food, only increases sensual desires.
</p><p>Your self (desires) is like when breastfed.
</p><p>Loves suckling but when you wean it, will stop.
</p><p>Then stop its inclinations and beware that it does not overpower you.
</p><p>Verily lust whenever it overpowers (it  will) kill or maim  (your character).
</p><p>And guard it while it is grazing in (the field of) actions
</p><p>If it enjoys pasture, do not let it roam (graze) freely.
</p><p>How often has pleasure been considered good, whereas it turned out to be deadly.
</p><p>Because he does not know that there is poison in  the  fat.
</p><p>And fear the evil  of (both) hunger and satiation.
</p><p>For most times hungers (poverty) is more evil that overeating.
</p><p>And shed tears from those eyes which have become full.
</p><p>Of forbidden sights and regard it as obligatory (upon yourself) to guard your eyes from forbidden things.
</p><p>And oppose (your) self (nafs) and shaytaan and disobey them both.
</p><p>And if both of them give you sincere advice regard it as lies.
</p><p>And do not obey them both (nafs and shaytaan) as an enemy or as a wise (person).
</p><p>For you know well the deception of (such) an enemy or a wise (person).
</p><p>I seek forgiveness from Allah from such sayings (preachings) which I do practice upon.
</p><p>For verily I have attributed (claimed), through this, offspring from a barren woman.
</p><p>I command you to do good but I do not command  myself to do the same.
</p><p>And I was not steadfast (on deen) so then of what use (value) is my saying to you: "Be steadfast!" (on deen).
</p><p>And I made no provisions before death of voluntary (nafl) worship.
</p><p>And I did not perform salaat nor did I fast except what was obligatory.
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="60%"><p>
</p><p>I transgressed the sunnat of him (Rasulullah) who passed the night (in ibaadat).
</p><p>Until his feet complained of injury due to being swollen.
</p><p>And he tied and folded, on account of hunger, around hi stomach.
</p><p>A stone beneath which is his delicate skin.
</p><p>And high mountains of gold (tried to) tempt him.
</p><p>Towards it, but he was (completely) disinclined due to his high courage.
</p><p>His piety increased inspite of his need.
</p><p>For verily need never prevails (overpowers) the infallible.
</p><p>How can the necessities of such a noble personality incline him towards this world.
</p><p>For had it not been for him this world would not have come out of non existence.
</p><p>And of both groups, Arabs and non Arabs.
</p><p>Our Nabi, the one who commands (good), forbids (evil). There is non (parallel to him).
</p><p>More truthful than him in saying "No" or "Yes".
</p><p>He is (Allah's) most beloved, whose intercession is  hoped for.
</p><p>For every fear (and distress) that is going to come (on the day) of agony (and fears).
</p><p>He called (people) towards Allah, so those who cling to him.
</p><p>Clinging to a rope which will never snap.
</p><p>He transcends the Ambiyaa, physically and in (noble) character. 
</p><p>And (the other Ambiyaa) cannot come near his in knowledge and noble nature kindness.
</p><p>They all obtained from Rasulullah (s)
</p><p>(Like a) handful (of water) from the ocean or (a few) sips from continuous rains.
</p><p>And they all stopped before him at their (assigned) limits.
</p><p>(Either)  of a point of knowledge or to gain one wisdom from (his) wisdom.
</p><p>For he is the on e with whom, ended all outward and inward perfection.
</p><p>And then the creator of all creation chose his as (His) most beloved.
</p><p>He has no equal in his magnificence.
</p><p>The jewel of (excellence) in him is indivisible.
</p><p>Discard what the christians claim about their Nabi
</p><p>Then decide and say what you wish in praise of him (Rasulullah).
</p><p>And attribute towards his personality whatever you wish of excellence.
</p><p>And attribute to his dignified status as mush greatness as you wish.
</p><p>For verily excellence of the Messenger of Allah has no (limits)
</p><p>Bounds, that a speaker might (be able to) express with his mouth.
</p><p>If his miracles were proportionate (according) to his rank, in greatness,
</p><p>Then his name would have, when called out brought decaying bones back to life.
</p><p>He did not try to (test) us with that which would confound our minds.
</p><p> Out of keen interest (kindness) for us, neither were we suspicious 9about the truthfulness of his mission) nor were we confounded (by his doctrines).
</p><p>His perfect inner nature made people helpless from comprehending, so it was not understood.
</p><p>Those near and far, except according to their (helpless) imperfect understanding.
</p><p>Like how the sun is seen by the eyes from far.
</p><p>Verily small, yet hurts (dazzles) the eye (when you stare at it).
</p><p>And can the reality of him be comprehended in this world.
</p><p>A sleeping nation whose description of him are (like interpretations of) a dream.
</p><p>So the extreme depth of (our) knowledge concerning him, is that he is a man.
</p><p>And verily he is the best of all the creation of Allah.
</p><p>Every miracle which all the Nabi?s showed.
</p><p>Verily they have been derived from his noor.
</p><p>For verily he is the sun of virtue (and) they (Ambiyaa) are its stars.
</p><p>Which show their lights to people only in the dark.
</p><p>Until when the sun rose his light spread.
</p><p>Universally  and gave life to all the nations.
</p><p>How noble are the physical qualities of Nabi (s), adorned with good character.
</p><p>(Who) was vested with beauty and disguised by pleasant temperament.
</p><p>(He) is like a blooming flower in its freshness and the full moon in splendour.
</p><p>And the ocean in generosity and time its fearless courage.
</p><p>Even when alone, it appears sue to his grandeur.
</p><p>As though (he is) in the midst of a large army and its retinue.
</p><p>It is like pearls well preserved in oysters.
</p><p>From the two mines, of his speech and his smiles.
</p><p>No perfume equals the dust (earth) which is touching his (Rasulullah's mubarak) body.
</p><p>Glad tidings be to the person who smells it (the dust) and kisses it.
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="60%"><p>
</p><p>His birth distinctly showed his pure origin.
</p><p>O the excellence! Of his beginning and his end.
</p><p>On that day the Persians discovered that they (were going face misfortune)
</p><p>Were warned with the approach of misfortune and punishment.
</p><p>And the walls of the palace of Kisra trembled and crumbled.
</p><p>Like how the army of Kisra was scattered never to be untied again.
</p><p>And the fire (of the Persians) took a cool breath (subsided and died out), out of regret.
</p><p>While the rivers (of Persia) had sleepless eyes (dries up) from excessive sorrow.
</p><p>Saawah (village in Persia) became grief stricken with the drying up of its lake.
</p><p>And the (thirsty) water bearer returned in anger with disappointment.
</p><p>It is as though fire became wet like water.
</p><p>Due to grief, while water was (affected by)  the blazing fire.
</p><p>And the jinn was shouting (at the appearance of Rasulullah) and the NUR was glistening.
</p><p>And the truth (nubuwaat) appeared with these anwaar, and with their voices.
</p><p>(The kaafir) became blind and deaf, to the announcements of glad tidings.
</p><p>Nor did they hear and the lighting of warning was nor seen by them.
</p><p>After their fortune tellers had informed the people.
</p><p>That their false religions would not stand.
</p><p>And even after they witnessed shooting stars on the horizon.
</p><p>Falling, just as (their) idols were (falling) on earth.
</p><p>So much so that  they kept running from the path of wahi
</p><p>The devils (shaytaan),  one after the other.
</p><p>As though in running away the shaytaan were the army of Abrahah.
</p><p>Or like that army (put to flight) upon whom (Rasulullah) threw pebbles.
</p><p>Which he threw after their making tasbih in his (mubarak hands).
</p><p>Like how (Prophet Yunus, p) when he made tasbih (of Allah) was thrown out from the stomach of the swallowing (fish).
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="60%"><p>
</p><p>The trees answered his call, prostrating.
</p><p>Walking towards him on shins (truck) without feet.
</p><p>It is though writing lines that were written.
</p><p>With their branches, calligraphically writing of his perfection.
</p><p>Like the cloud following him wherever he went.
</p><p>Sheltering him from the intense heat, (as that) of an oven in the blazing summer.
</p><p>I take an oath (of truth) by the moon that was split, it bears.
</p><p>A connection with his heart (which shows) the truth of my oath.
</p><p>What excellence qualities and noble deeds the cave contained (in it).
</p><p>While every eye (of the disbelievers) was blind him.
</p><p>The truth (sidq) and the true(siddique) in the cave were not seen (by the disbelievers).
</p><p>And they were satiny "There  is no one in the cave".
</p><p>They thought a wild dove and a spider would not
</p><p>Lay an egg, or spin a web for the best of creation.
</p><p>The protection of Allah (made him) dispensed with double.
</p><p>From armours and high forts.
</p><p>Whenever time caused me any distress and I took refuge in him.
</p><p>I receive shelter from him which was not misused.
</p><p>I did not ask for the wealth of the two worlds from his hand.
</p><p>But I received a great gift the best hand that was ever kissed.
</p><p>Do not deny that his dreams are revelations (wahi), for verily his
</p><p>Heart does not sleep , when eyes sleep.
</p><p>And this was at (the period of) puberty of his prophethood.
</p><p>At that time dreams cannot be denied.
</p><p>Great are the blessings of Allah that wahi is nor earned.
</p><p>Nor was any Nabi accused (of lying when) giving knowledge of the unseen.
</p><p>His miracles are (completely) clear, not hidden from anyone.
</p><p>Without it justice cannot be established amongst people.
</p><p>How often has his hand granted freedom (cure) from disease by (his) touch.
</p><p>And set free the insane from the chains (fetters) of insanity.
</p><p>He revived the starving year (of famine) through his dua.
</p><p>Until it resembled a white spot on black times.
</p><p>By means of a cloud which rained so abundantly, you would think large rivers
</p><p>Gushing forth from the sea or like the torrential flood of Arim.
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="60%"><p>
</p><p>Allow me to describe the miracles of him (Rasuluallah) exposed (performed).
</p><p>Like the lighting of fires on the hillside at night for guests.
</p><p>The beauty of a pearl is further enhanced in a necklace.
</p><p>But its value does not diminish)in the  least when not strung on a necklace).
</p><p>So why should the ambitions of those who praise not increase towards
</p><p>That which him (Rasuluallah)  ha of noble character and good habits.
</p><p>Verses of truth from the Most Merciful (Allah) newly heard.
</p><p>(As well as being) eternal which is quality (of Allah) Who is described with eternity.
</p><p>It is not connected with any period of time, while it informs us.
</p><p>About the hereafter as well as of Ad and Iram.
</p><p>Which remains with us forever, therefore it is superior to every miracle.
</p><p>Of the other Nabi?s (for) when (their miracles) came but did not remain.
</p><p>Absolutely  clear (as evidence) so it did not leave (room for any) doubts.
</p><p>By the enemies nor so they require any judge.
</p><p>No one opposed it ever except for the vehement enemy.
</p><p>(Due to) the enmity of the enemy towards it,(but that he) refrained from it seeking a truce.
</p><p>Its eloquence refuted the accusations of its objectors.
</p><p>Just as a respectable man keeps off the hand of a transgressor from his harem.
</p><p>Its meaning is like the waves of the ocean in helping (one another)
</p><p>And the (Qur?an) transcends the jewels of the sea in beauty and value.
</p><p>Its wonders cannot be counted nor comprehended.
</p><p>Nor would you (be) satiated by its constant repetition (recitation).
</p><p>It cools the eye of  its reciter, so I said to him
</p><p>You have succeeded with the hope of Allah, therefore hold steadfast onto it.
</p><p>If you recite it due to fear of the heat of blazing  fire.
</p><p>Then you have doused the blazing fire with its cool water.
</p><p>It is the Houze-e-Kauthar with which faces are illuminated.
</p><p>Of the sinners even though they came to it (with faces) black as coal.
</p><p>It is like the straight bridge like the scales in equilibrium.
</p><p> Justice, without which, amongst man cannot be established.
</p><p> Do not be astonished if the jealous person rejects it.
</p><p>(Feigning) ignorance while they are shrewd.
</p><p>Verily the eye rejects the ray of the sun due to dust.
</p><p>The mouth rejects the (sweet) taste of water due to sickness.
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="60%"><p>
</p><p>You the best of those to whose court seekers of bounties resort.
</p><p>Running the (mounted) on the backs of fast camels.
</p><p>And O you is the greatest sign for he who takes a lesson.
</p><p>And O you who is the greatest bounty for a  person who avails himself of it.
</p><p>You travelled by night from one sacred place to another.
</p><p>As the full moon travels trough intense darkness.
</p><p>And you continued ascending until you attained a position.
</p><p>At the distance of two cubits length, as has never been attained nor sought.
</p><p>And you preferred due to your position by all the Ambiyaa.
</p><p>And Rasuls just as a servant gives preference to his master.
</p><p>You passed the seven heavens with them.
</p><p>In a procession in which you were the standard bearer.
</p><p>Until you left no gaol (for) any competitor to strive for.
</p><p>In closeness, nor any (room for ascent for any one to advance.
</p><p>You made inferior every position by (your) advance, when.
</p><p>You were invited to his majestic and unique position.
</p><p>So that you may be successful in a reaching the most concealed.
</p><p>From all eyes, and secrets well concealed.
</p><p>So you acquired every (status) worthy of pride unrivalled.
</p><p>And you surpassed every position which none other passed.
</p><p>And extremely excellent are the ranks that were granted to you.
</p><p>And uncomprehensible are those bounties which conferred upon you.
</p><p>Glad tiding be to us o people of Islam. We have.
</p><p>By the Grace of Allah a pillar which is indestructible.
</p><p>When Allah called, the one who invited us  (Rasuluallah, s)  to His worship.
</p><p>Because of the noblest of messengers , we are the noblest of ummats.
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="60%"><p>
</p><p>The hearts of his enemies were struck with terror at the news of his advent.
</p><p>Just as a heedless goat that has strayed the heard becomes scared to a sudden alarm.
</p><p>He never ceased to encounter them at every battle.
</p><p>Until, by the effects of lances they were like meat on a chopping block.
</p><p>They loved fleeing that they would envy.
</p><p>The corpses which were  carried away by vultures and eagles.
</p><p>Nights would pass without them knowing number.
</p><p>As long as it was not nights of the sacred months.
</p><p>It is as though the religion of Islam was a guest that visited their house.
</p><p>With every brave warrior, greedy for the flesh of the  enemy.
</p><p>He used to lead an ocean of an army on galloping horses.
</p><p>They would strike (the enemy) with a massive wave of brave warriors.
</p><p>Of every volunteer, having hope of reward from Allah.
</p><p>Fighting to exterminate the roots of kufr  and to destroy it.
</p><p>Until the religion of  Islam became of them.
</p><p>Reunited after her estrangement, with her family.
</p><p>Always taken care of by an affectionate father
</p><p>And a loving husband, so she did not suffer from orphanhood nor widowhood.
</p><p>They were mountains, so ask about them from him who fought them.
</p><p>What was his experience with them in each contest (battle).
</p><p>Ask (them about the condition of) Hunain, Badr, Uhad.
</p><p>The verdict death for them was more severe than an epidemic.
</p><p>(They made their) white (shinning) swords red (with blood) after they were plunged.
</p><p>Into every black lock of  (hair) of their enemies.
</p><p>And they write (with arrows) in calligraphic writing (on those of the bodies), which was left out.
</p><p>By their pens (lances). Like undotted letters,
</p><p>Completely clad with weapons they had characteristic marks to distinguish them.
</p><p>Like arose is distinguished  by (characteristic) marks  from a thorn tree.
</p><p>The winds of help (from Allah) would guide you to their fragrance.
</p><p>So you would think every brave man to be a flower in the bud.
</p><p>As though they were, when on horse back like the plants on hills.
</p><p>On account of the strength and bravery, not because of the tightness of their saddles.
</p><p>The hearts of the enemies flew into terror (due to their) prowess.
</p><p>So they could not make distinction between a lamb and a mighty warrior.
</p><p>And the person who has the help of Rasuluallah (s) with him.
</p><p>Even if a lion meets him in its den it begins to fear.
</p><p>And you would never see a friend not assisted.
</p><p>By him, nor would you find any enemy, but in pieces.
</p><p>He lodged his ummat in the fort of his religion.
</p><p>Like a lion which lodges with its cubs in a jungle.
</p><p>How many queries did the words of Allah have with defiers.
</p><p>Concerning him, and the clear evidence (of Allah), disputed many a plaintiff.
</p><p>It is sufficient for you as a miracle (to have so vast) knowledge in an unlettered person.
</p><p>In the period of ignorance, and such noble etiquettes in an orphan.
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="60%"><p>
</p><p>I served him with praise, by means of which I ask to be pardoned.
</p><p>The sins of a life passed in poetry and serving (other)
</p><p>As these  two have garlanded me with that consequences which I fear.
</p><p>As though I am due to it (poetry and serving others) a sacrificial animal.
</p><p>I obeyed the misleading passions of youth in both conditions and I  did not
</p><p>I achieved but sin and remorse.
</p><p>O the great regret of my soul in its transaction.
</p><p>It did not purchase Deen with the world, nor had I negotiated for it.
</p><p>The person who sells his future  for his present.
</p><p>His being defrauded in the sale  and its negotiation.
</p><p>If I had committed any sin my covenant is not (likely to be) violated.
</p><p>With my Nabi Rasuluallah (s) and nor is my rope broken.
</p><p>For verily I have a security from him due to my name.
</p><p>(Being) Muhammad, while he is the most faithful of mankind in fulfilling his promise.
</p><p>If at  my resurrection, he should not take me by my hand
</p><p>Out of kindness, then say O the slipping of my foot.
</p><p>I seek the sanctuary (in Allah) that he should deprive one who is hopeful of his graces.
</p><p>Or that his neighbour (follower) returned from him dishonoured.
</p><p>And since I have devoted my thoughts to his praises.
</p><p>I have found him to be best sanctuary for my salvation.
</p><p>His bounty will never escape from (my) hand which has been soiled.
</p><p>For verily rain causes flowers to bloom on rocks
</p><p>And I did seek the flowers (wealth) of the world which were plucked.
</p><p> By the hands of Zuhair through his praises of Haram.
</p><p></p><hr size="1" width="60%"><p>
</p><p>Most generous of mankind, I have no one to take refuge in
</p><p>Except you at occurrence of widespread calamity.
</p><p>And O messenger of Allah, your exalted status will not diminish, because of me (intercession on my behalf)
</p><p>When most Bountiful (Allah Ta?alaa) will manifest (Himself) by the name of the punisher.
</p><p>For verily amongst your bounties is this world, and the hereafter.
</p><p>And part of your knowledge is knowledge of the Preserved Tablet (Lowh), and the Pen.
</p><p>O my soul do not become despondent  due to your grievous sins.
</p><p>Verily major sins when pardoned are minor.
</p><p>Perhaps the mercy of my Lord when distributed.,
</p><p>Would be distributed in proportion to the sins.
</p><p>O my Lord (Sustainer)! Make my hopes, not unfulfilled.
</p><p>By you, and make  my reckoning (of deeds) not destructive.
</p><p>Be kind to Your Servant in both the worlds, for verily his
</p><p>Patience, when called upon by hardships (calamities), runs away.
</p><p>So order clouds of blessings (salutations) from you perpetually.
</p><p>Upon Nabi (s) abundantly and gently 
</p><p>And upon his family, his Sahabah, then upon those who follow them.
</p><p>The people of piety, knowledge, clemency and generosity.
</p><p>(Then) be pleased with Abu-bakr  and Omar.
</p><p>And Ali and Uthman, the people of nobility.
</p><p>As long as the easterly breeze makes the branches of cypress rustle.
</p><p>And (as long as) the camel riders make their camels march with the enchanting songs.
</p><p>Forgive its writer and its reader
</p><p>I ask of you all goodness O You the Most Generous and Most Munificent.
