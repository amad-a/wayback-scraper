Palestine-Net received a request from Mr. Judson Horn (judson.m.horn@us.ahrthurandersen.com) to display the following ad for the Palestinian Expatriate Professional Program. Please check the positions listed below and let your friends know if they are interested. Thank you,<br>
_________________________
<br>
<p>We would like to inquire about the possibility of displaying
an advertisement<br>
link for the West Bank and Gaza Positions for the Palestinian
Expatriate<br>
Program, or PEPP.  The PEPP has a website located at: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020610143658/http://www.aapepp.com/">http://www.aapepp.com</a> that<br>
helps to recruit qualified expatriate Palestinian professionals
for senior<br>
management and technical specialist positions in selected
Palestinian government<br>
ministries and agencies for an extended period.<br>
<br>
We have contacted you because you have a website that is similar
in nature to<br>
our own. Would you be so kind as to provide a link from your site
to ours?<br>
<br>
the link should read:<br>
<br>

(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020610143658/http://www.aapepp.com/">http://www.aapepp.com</a>)<br>
<br>
At this point in time, we have roughly 21 job openings in the
West Bank and Gaza<br>
Strip. I have attached the full advertisement below for your
review with all<br>
changes already implemented.  For more information about the
project, our web<br>
address is &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020610143658/http://www.aapepp.com/">www.aapepp.com</a>&gt;. 
However, pls note that web changes are forthcoming<br>
since some jobs have been filled and others have opened up.<br>
<br>
Let me thank you in advance for your assistance.  I look forward
to hearing from<br>
you at your earliest convenience.<br>
