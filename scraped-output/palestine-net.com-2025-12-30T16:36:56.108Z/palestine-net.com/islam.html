<h1>Palestine-Net: Islam </h1>
<p>Thank you for stopping by! Palestine is home to the three
monothiestic faiths. The pre-colonial and pre-occupation
composition was less than 7% Jewish (reached 8% by 1918) , around
10% (in 1918) Christian and the rest were Muslims. Almost all
spoke, understood and communicated in Arabic (some spoke other
languages as well). Things changed with the British Mandate then
the Israeli occupation in favor of the occupation at the expense
of Muslims and Christians. </p>
<p>This is not a survey of religions in Palestine. If you've been here before, we are sorry, but the links no
longer exist. We suggest you visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020803030443/http://www.arabic2000.com/user/islam/">Islam- The Identity</a>
on Arabic2000.com.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
