The Kinetic Painting Group improvises animated computer painting with sound.  
The moving abstraction is projected onto a theater-size screen while the painter 
plays the keyboard which creates the painting.  Musicians react to the visual signal as 
the painter reacts to the sounds.  Each work is an improvisational jamming of 
sound and image.  The interaction is spontaneous and free within a chosen theme.

This is neither a pictorial accompanyment to music nor a musical accompanyment to 
an animation.  The two media interact to create the new formal ideas.  You may 
read a brief description of the <a href="group/themes.html">themes</a>.  
</p><p>
The computer <a href="group/program.html">program</a> which makes this possible was written by the painter 
Samia A. Halaby.  It converts the computer keyboard in such a way that pressing 
the keys creates the moving images in the similar way as the keys of a piano 
create sounds.  This allows the painter to create an abstract painting intuitively 
and spontaneously in live performance with musicians.
</p><p>
A video was recorded during performance.  The visual material is recorded 
directly from the computer signal while sound is recorded from the sound system.
