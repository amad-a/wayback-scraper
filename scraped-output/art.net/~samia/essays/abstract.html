<h2>Abstraction And Illusion</h2>
<p>
by Samia A. Halaby, April 1995
</p><p><b>
Abstraction is just as connected to nature and reality as is illusionism.
It relies on reality as its only source.  I disagree with historians and  
critics who claim that it is based on purely mental formulations.  
</b></p><p><b>
Even though the representation of nature may seem more direct in an illusionist
painting its presence is not more significant than in abstraction.  While illusionist painters approach nature from a single
point of view, abstractionists seek to extract and depict general 
principles of motion.  Whereas the illusionists paint their subject while 
sitting still in one place, an abstract painter may walk around a subject 
or contemplate how it resembles other things.
</b></p><p><b>
To paint the morning, Monet painted a cathedral bathed in light from one 
point of view.  He captured the morning colors of a specific season and place.
To paint the morning an abstract painter, on the other hand, may select any one of numerous palettes which would describe morning, use the shapes more likely to be seen early in the day, and as much  variation of rhythm and detail of texture as would communicate a flavor of morning.  Thus while the illusionist captures particulars while the abstractionist captures the essence of things.
</b></p><p><b>
Because abstract representations deal with general principles their content 
excludes the imaging of particular objects and specific people.  This frees 
them from the burden of illustrating any one nation's mythological and 
propagandistic agenda.  As a consequence, they transcend national boundaries 
more readily.  It makes sense, then, that in the history of the twentieth century, 
abstraction began with the international spread of Cubism and Constrctivism.
