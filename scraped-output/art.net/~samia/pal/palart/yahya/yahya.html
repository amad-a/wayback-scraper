<blockquote><font size="+1">A Review of the exhibition:&nbsp; From Sabra
and Shatila.. to Indpendence?</font>

The May 1999 show at Darat Al-Funun in Jordan is made up of
sets of graphic works and paintings.&nbsp; The images are variations on
the theme of tyranny and oppression.&nbsp; In one set of nineteen ink drawings,
we see heaps of massacred humanity.&nbsp; At each heap there is a small
event which crowns the horror.&nbsp;  For example a figure in screaming
anguish, or a woman holding a baby and gesturing for help, or an old man
pulling a dead youth out of the heap, or a youth pulling an old man, or
two children walking away, or a face staring out of the pile at the crescent
moon is the event dramatized by the background of horror.

</b></font></font></p><p><font size="+1"><font size="+.5"><b>
In one of them an oversized truck runs over the mass of dead bodies as took place
in the massacre at Sabra and Shatila camps.&nbsp;  Hanging at one end of the set
is one work which is most powerful.&nbsp; In it two old women, etched
like African sculptures in a Picasso-like manner, stand with faces of wild
tigers and arms dangling helplessly over a heap of dead.&nbsp;  Over this
entire scene is a set of thick heavily entwined roots with
nasty fingers probing the dead to suck their juices.

In Yahya’s work there is no nobility.&nbsp;  These are
not specific pictures of particular events.&nbsp;  Rather, these paintings
are expressions of an idea of tyranny.&nbsp;  To create this, Yahya standardized
his forms and indulged in a detailed illusion of distortion, disintegration,
and decay.

</b></font></font></p><p><font size="+1"><font size="+.5"><b>
Most of the paintings are in grays with color reserved
for blood and floral offerings.&nbsp; In these paintings, the martyred dead
lie heavily on the backs of the pathetic crowd.&nbsp;  Two notable sets
of paintings enhance the show,  One is of faces in pain and the other
is of faces of Tyrants in decay.&nbsp;  Yahya creates an illusion of the
mucky color and texture which articulate the giant heads of tyrants.&nbsp; 
His skill is apparent in the totally visual differentiation between the
loathsome faces of the tyrants and the painful expression in the heads
of victims.
</b></font></font></p><p><font size="+1"><font size="+.5"><b>
At first one is frightened at the depressing truth that
seems to be revealed.&nbsp;  An aimless pathetic existence intermingled
with depression and defeat.&nbsp;  Those who find the fright unbearable
will replace it with anger, which then they probably will direct at the
artist.&nbsp;  Others might accept that this is one face of the current
state of retreat in the Arab World and courageously continue their inspection.
</b></font></font></p><p><font size="+1"><font size="+.5"><b>
It is justified to wonder if this is painting at the
leading edge.&nbsp;  The questions to be asked are those of how we see society
and not of how we understand avant-garde painting.&nbsp;  These are painting
of social commentary.&nbsp;  Yahya allows us to decide the precise parameters
of who the tyrant is and who the oppressed. 
</b></font></font></p><p><font size="+1"><font size="+.5"><b>
There are but a few symbols of a national nature to identify
the characters.&nbsp;  But the allusions are clearly to the Arab World and
there is no mistaking the oppression of Palestinians by Israelis in this
work.&nbsp;  We see a consistently depressing scene with only a whimper
of resistance.&nbsp;  The rich heroism of the Palestinian refugee camp is
absent.&nbsp;  Only the pain of life of those who suffer is presented. 
</b></font></font></p><p><font size="+1"><font size="+.5"><b>
Thus, the work is narrowly focussed in attitude and content.&nbsp; 
The graphic work is in all respects more successful
than the painting.&nbsp;  Both rely on the history of painting of social
commentary.&nbsp;  To his credit, Yahya seems to be aware of the historical
currents in social realism. &nbsp; Many such allusions to this history are
visible in his work including particularly the work of Heironymus
Bosch, Francisco Goya, and Kathe Kollwitz.&nbsp;  His references and his
expressive ambitions are international.
