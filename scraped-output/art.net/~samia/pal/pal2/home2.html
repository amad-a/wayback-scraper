My great anticipation is realized.  The hurdle of the Israeli border
is past.  I am in Palestine.  Our path is right through Beisan. 
Ah! Beisan. I search the sights for the reflections my heart.  
The Hebrew sign names it as 'Bet Sheim.'  
to make it antiseptic for its strictly Israeli residents, the Palestinian
villagers have been forcibly evicted to a life of want in refugee 
camps across the border.  Some of the new occupants have skimpy dress and  
bare bellies but many women wear long black skirts and some have white shawls.  
Are they trying to look earthy in imitation of the Palestinian
peasants whom they replace?  Is this a purchase of absolution? I visualize
them struggling through the thickness of their guilt.

The bus continues.  My eyes are wide open doorways.  The land is beautiful. 
I like nothing they did to it but I can see so easily how well they have 
irrigated it with US tax dollars.  Some of them are my own.  Ah the 
contradictory treacheries of privilege and advanced capitalism.  I look 
with chagrin at those poor palm trees which populated my childhood drawings.  
I do not like how they trim them.  They used to possess such 
gracious gestures.
