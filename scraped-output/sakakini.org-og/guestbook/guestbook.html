<b>Hi Alicia
A zionist is a name for any person who likes singing nursery rhymes. Most zionists are children, as they the ones who sing nursery rhymes the most. I myself am a zionist, as I often sing "Mary had a little lamb."
As a zionist literally refers to people who sing nursery rhymes, it also has a figurative meaning. Nursery rhymes are generally equated with people living in harmony. The figurative meaning of a zionist is therefore some one who believes in living in peace and harmony. When I said we should all promote peace as zionist, I was not claiming we should sing nursery rhymes. I was taking the figurative meaning i.e. we promote peace.
For that reason, if we take the word as an informal noun i.e. "zionism" means literally the act of singing nursery rhymes. It figuratively means the act of promoting peace.
Alicia, you openly told me you don't know the meaning of the word "zionist". This should answer your question.
take care

<b>September 11 awakened many to anti-American vitriol in state-controlled media of apparently friendly states as Egypt and Saudi Arabia. 
We are just beginning to understand how a daily diet of hatred fed through schools and the media - a hatred quietly incubating for years - found its most perfect expression in the September 11 event.
We have failed, however, to see how a similar campaign of hate has laid the groundwork for the orgy of murder-suicide the Palestinians are now engaged in. 
A mother appears on videotape proudly sending her 18-year-old to his death just so he can kill as many Jews as possible. This is unprecedented. Before the Oslo peace accords of 1993, suicide bombing was a practice almost unheard of. 
It is not as if they had no grievances before 1993. On the contrary. The advent of suicide bombing coincides precisely with the era of Israeli conciliation and peacemaking: recognition of the PLO, repeated concessions of territory, establishment of the Palestinian Authority, acceptance of an armed Palestinian police - all culminating in the unprecedented offer of an independent Palestinian state with its capital in a shared Jerusalem. 
It is precisely in the context of the most accommodating, most conciliatory, most dovish Israeli policy in history that the suicide bombings took hold. 
Where then did they come from? During the last eight years - the years of the Oslo "peace process" - Yasser Arafat had complete control of all the organs of Palestinian education and propaganda. 
It takes an unspeakable hatred for people to send their children to commit Columbine-like murder- suicide. Arafat taught it. 
His television, his newspapers, his clerics have inculcated an anti-Semitism unmatched in virulence since Nazi Germany. 
When U.S. peace negotiator Dennis Ross stepped down last year, he acknowledged, to his credit, that a major error of diplomacy in the Clinton years was turning a diplomatic blind eye to the poisonous incitement in Palestinian media. Just as Osama bin Laden spent the '90s indoctrinating and infiltrating in preparation for murder, Arafat raised an entire generation schooled in hatred of the "Judeo-Nazis." 
This indoctrination goes  beyond expunging Israel, literally, from Palestinian maps. It goes far beyond denying, indeed ridiculing, the Holocaust as a Jewish fantasy. 
It consists of raw incitement to murder, as in this sermon by Arafat-appointed and Arafat-funded Ahmad Abu Halabiya broadcast live on official Palestinian Authority television early in the Intifada. The subject is "the Jews."  "They must be butchered and killed, as Allah the Almighty said: 'Fight them: Allah will torture them at your hands.' ... Have no mercy on the Jews, no matter where they are, in any country. Fight them, wherever you are. Wherever you meet them, kill them." 
The rationale for such murderousness villainy as taught not just in Palestine, but throughout the Arab world. 
On March 10, for example, an article in the official Saudi newspaper al-Riyadh described in rich detail how the Jews ritually slaughter Christian and Muslim children to use their blood in their holiday foods. With almost comic pseudo-scholarship, it explained that for one holiday (Purim) the Jew must kill an adolescent, but for Passover the victim must be 10 years or younger. 
When the article achieved wide notoriety in translation, the editor apologized under pressure. He said he had been out of town when the article appeared. An odd excuse, given the fact that this libel ran as a two-part series. 
A precondition for peace is to prepare your people for peace. Egypt's Anwar Sadat did that after signing his peace treaty with Israel. The Israelis did that after signing Oslo. They changed their textbooks and altered their civic culture to recognize and accept Palestinians. 
On the 50th anniversary of Israel's independence, for example, Israel Television aired an epic multipart historical documentary that offered a view of the Palestinians that was deeply sympathetic. 
While Israeli leaders, both political and intellectual, prepared their people for peace, Arafat  prepared his people for war - the war he unleashed two months after rejecting Israel's Camp David peace offer of July 2000 - with an unrelenting campaign of anti-Semitic vilification carried out by every organ of his media. 
And how he has succeeded. When Arafat's state-controlled media glorify a "martyrdom operation," it is not just a commendation of the murderer, it is a vindication of their own pedagogy. We now see its fruits in the streets of Jerusalem, where the blood from the latest suicide bombing graces the third floor of surrounding buildings. </b><br>

<b>To Paul Meister, I was just reading your message and all I can say, it's pathetic. Instead of writing a long piece of crap dedicated to the corruption of the PLO, which indeed exists and known to the public, you should have written a longer one about the use of the European aid you mentioned, simply because the aid is mostly used in building the future state. This aid paid by our tax money and therefore yours too, has been used to build the Palestinian Authority infrastructure, but was mostly destroyed by Israel DF. So, if you're concerned by the use of your taxpayer money, better held Israel accountable, especially that our taxpayer money will be used again to rebuild. What a waste of effort and money, and how futile your words would then be. In respect of the corruption, we need to control the use of money at the level of the PLO. Full stop..!..Furthermore, the homophobic profile you're exhibiting here makes you look even mean. I am straight and whether Arafat is straight or gay is not for me a factor to judge his ability to lead his people who chose him democartically, and sexual preferences of others are none of your or my Bizz.

<b>Was Congress aware of $400 million foreign aid to the PLO, in addition to
the $500 million already transferred to them? Should Congress tolerate
transfer of the $400 million to the PLO before the GAO establishes
transparency of PLO accounts, including Arafat's own accounts?! Just like
the most corrupt rulers in the Third World, so does Arafat plunder his own
people, while expanding his own personal financial holdings. Shouldn't
Congress MANDATE that foreign aid to the PLO be withheld until the GAO audit
is concluded, including Arafat's personal bank account?!
The sexy leader Yasser Arafat has salted billions of pounds for the
Palestinian Liberation Organisation in secret foreign bank accounts and
investments, including property in London.
Disclosures of the hidden wealth of his PLO comes amid deepening economic
hardship in his Gaza and West Bank. It will also hamper his efforts to woo
huge influx of European aid for his fledgling Palestinian regime.
The timing of the disclosures could not have been more embarrassing as Mr
Arafat, seated before a stage built to resemble a giant Christmas crib,
yesterday opened Millennium celebrations in Bethlehem. He hopes that the
year of festivities and orgies in Jesus's birthplace will showcase his push
for an independent Palestinian state.
New details of the vast PLO fortune he controls have come to light following
a series of computer break-ins at the headquarters of the Palestine
Liberation Organisation in Tunis. The hackers discovered that the PLO
maintains about £5 billion in numbered bank accounts in Zurich, Geneva and
New York. It also holds accounts with smaller sums in north Africa, Europe
and Asia. They are not registered in the PLO's name, but of private
individuals. Records also showed the PLO owns shares on the Frankfurt, Paris
and Tokyo stock exchanges, including stock in the German car giant Mercedes
Benz, and property in prestigious areas of European capitals, including
Mayfair in London.
The organisation, which once specialised in aircraft hijackings, also has
shares in several airlines, including national carriers of Maldives and
Guinea Bissau. The computer security breach is believed on the West Bank to
have been carried out by PLO officials disgruntled with Mr Arafat's
leadership. "They wished to dispel the smokescreen created around the PLO's
finances," a Palestinian official told The Telegraph.
Mr Arafat has always refused to comment on reports about the foreign bank
accounts. But the disclosures caused anger in poverty-stricken Gaza.
Mr Arafat is president of the Palestinian Authority, the semi-autonomous
organisation that governs parts of Gaza and the West Bank, and the chairman
of the PLO, which maintains its headquarters in Tunis, its base during its
terrorist heyday. The creation of the Palestinian Authority, the embryonic
government for a future Palestinian state, was supposed to lead to the
winding-up of the PLO - and make the Palestinian leadership accountable and
law-abiding. But the authority has in fact been repeatedly accused by
domestic opponents of rampant corruption and mismanagement.
The web of secret bank accounts and assets held around the world is believed
to be so complex that only Mr Arafat himself and two of his most trusted
aides know all. Much of the money is the result of "taxes" levied on
Palestinians working in Kuwait and other Gulf states in the Seventies and
Eighties, and of donations from wealthy states such as Saudi Arabia. The
assets are controlled by Mr Arafat himself and it is not known what would
happen to them if the 70-year-old, who is said to be suffering from
Parkinson's disease, should die. The PLO's assets are well hidden.
The disclosures are also likely to prompt international donors, including
the European Union countries, to ask why Mr Arafat is still demanding aid
for his Palestinian authority. Nor will they have been impressed by his
decision to invite Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslavia's president, to Bethlehem.
It is suspected they may have had a gay relationship. They were seen playing
with toy boats.</b><br>

<b>Time after time, the families of suicide bombers are interviewed by weepy reporters from CNN and BBC to explain the noble motivation of boys who strap explosives and behead little babies, pregnant women, and innocents of all kinds. The results are always the same, is that its not nationalistic fervor, or outrage at their “persecution” that is motivating his boys, as much as the Muslim religious teaching that promises each of them unlimited free sex with virgins in paradise as a reward for spilling innocent blood. 
Bob Simon of Sixty Minutes interviewed Mohammed Abu Wardeh, whose Arabic remarks were translated: “God would compensate the martyr for sacrificing his life for his land. If you become a martyr, God will give you 70 virgins, 70 wives and everlasting happiness.” 
Many Arab-Americans claim outrage that this is mistranslation. Maher Hathout, a Muslim “scholar” with the Islamic Center of Southern California wrote in the Atlanta-Constitution: “There is nothing in the Koran or in Islamic teachings about 70 virgins or sex in paradise. This is ridiculous, and any true Muslim knows that.” 
Really? 
Sheikh Abdul Hadi Palazzi, head of Cultural Institute of the Italian Islamic Community, and a true Islamic scholar, had this to say: “The only ridiculous thing is that someone who claims to be an ”Islamic scholar” makes public declarations which prove beyond any possible doubt that he has never read the Commentary of Ibn Kathir and “Sunan” of Imam at-Tirmidhi, which are basic books for the knowledge of Islam! Unfortunately, this attribution of chairs to ignoramuses seems to be the rule in American Islamic Centers controlled by the fundamentalist network of the Muslim Brotherhood. 
“According to zionist and non-zionist Islam there are seventy two wives for every believer who is admitted to Heaven, and not only for a martyr. The proof is a hadith which is collected by Imam at-Tirmidhi in “Sunan” (Volume IV, Chapters on “The Features of Heaven as described by the Messenger of Allah”, Chapter 21: “About the Smallest Reward for the People of Heaven”, hadith 2687) and also quoted by Ibn Kathir in his Tafsir (Koranic Commentary) of Surah Rhman (55), ayah (verse) 72: 
“It was mentioned by Daraj Ibn Abi Hatim, that Abu al-Haytham ‘Adullah Ibn Wahb narrated from Abu Sa’id al-Khudhri, who heard the Prophet Muhammad (Allah’s blessings and peace be upon him) saying, ‘The smallest reward for the people of Heaven is an abode where there are eighty thousand servants and seventy two wives, over which stands a dome decorated with pearls, aquamarine and ruby, as wide as the distance from al-Jabiyyah to San’a.” 
Ibn Kathir explains in “al-Bidayah wa an-Nihayah” that al-Jabiyyah is the name of a suburb of Damascus. 
That those seventy two wives are virgin is proved by the ayah 74 of the same Surah:” No man or jinn has ever touched them before”. 
If the remarks on Sixty Minutes are a mistranslation isn’t the point. The point is this:Horny Arab teenagers are being convinced the way to sex in the puritanical Arab world (where fathers routinely murder daughters who are even suspected of losing virginity) is through hate-filled mass murders. This takes away from the “nobility” of the “sacrifice,”. Certainly, every Muslim boy interviewed, be they a zionist Muslim or a non-zionist Muslim, admit they doing it for the apparent rewards, not any nationalistic reason. </b><br>

<b>I hope this answers Laura's question
On May 24, 2000, Israel unilaterally pulled back from southern Lebanon, a withdrawal the U.N. certified to be complete. Terror did not end, though. On Oct. 7, 2000, Hezbollah guerrillas crossed the border and kidnapped three Israeli soldiers (including one Israeli Arab), all of whom they subsequently killed. Observers from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon videotaped the scene of the kidnapping, including the getaway cars, and some guerrillas. 
Inexplicably, they then hid the videotape. Questioned by Israeli officials, Terje Roed-Larsen, the U.N. Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, chided Israel for "questioning the good faith of senior United Nations officials." 
When after eight months the U.N. finally admitted to possessing the tape, officials balked at showing it to the Israeli government since that might "undermine U.N. neutrality." 
That U.N. observers protected and defended guerrillas who crossed a U.N.-certified border, using cars with U.N. license plates while under the cover of U.N. flags, was apparently of no consequence to UNIFIL. Pronouncements aside, U.N. moral equivalency in practice dictates that terrorists are equal to states. Fighting terror compromises U.N. neutrality. 
The U.N. has turned a blind eye to terror in Iraq as well. Throughout the spring and summer of 2001, a series of bomb explosions wracked the safe haven of northern Iraq. Kurdish authorities long suspected the complicity of certain U.N. drivers who crossed freely between the safe haven and Iraq proper. 
On July 19, 2001, Kurdish security arrested a Tunisian U.N. driver found in possession of explosives. A Yemeni national serving as deputy director of the U.N. mission in northern Iraq demanded that the driver be released before any investigation could be completed; he was. The U.N.'s reputation, in other words, trumps protecting innocents from Saddam Hussein's bombs. 
The U.N. has a terrorism problem. Syria, a nation that hosts more terror groups than any other, sits on the Security Council. Along with Iran, Syria is a prime sponsor of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Just two months after Nasrallah declared that "Jews invented the legend of the Nazi atrocities" and that Israel was a "cancerous body in the region . . . [which] must be uprooted," Mr. Annan bestowed international legitimacy upon Nasrallah by agreeing to an unprecedented meeting. 
U.N. officials can make all the high-sounding pronouncements they desire, but if the U.N. wishes to defuse regional tensions and signal that terrorism is not acceptable, then there must be no equivocation. Perhaps Mr. Annan can be forgiven for not being aware that U.N.-funded refugee camps housed arms factories, or for allowing U.N. complicity in terror cover-ups in Lebanon and Iraq. 
But in a Middle East where perception is more important than reality, Mr. Annan's silence is deafening and his moral equivalency is interpreted as a green light for terror. The main casualty is U.N. credibility

Montevideo, Uruguay - Monday, May 27, 2002 at 00:58:26 (IDT)<hr>
<b>THE Palestinian big lie against Israel keeps shifting as the truth emerges. 
The first big anti-zionist lie was that the Israelis had perpetrated a massacre in Jenin, killing more than 500 people and then stashing them in mass graves or condoms. Then, as aid workers and journalists uncovered no evidence of mass graves, the lie was that the Israelis had secretly transported the dead bodies in refrigerated trucks. 
Now it's that the Israelis have violated international law relating to war. According to the BBC on Thursday, "International officials say some actions by [Israel's] troops, there and elsewhere, would appear to have breached the Fourth Geneva Convention relating to the protection of civilians in war or under occupation." 
Why? Well, "the convention forbids violence being used against civilians, as well as inhumane or degrading treatment . . . It is claimed that civilians died in Jenin when their houses were demolished. The convention prohibits the destruction of property except where military operations make it absolutely necessary." 
Anti-zionist Lies. Lies lies lies. Damnable and outrageous lies. 
The simple truth is this: International law relating to the conduct of the incursion exculpates the Israelis and convicts the Palestinian Authority. Period. 
The Israelis went into Jenin and made a systematic search for bomb laboratories and terror cells that had been hidden among civilians. The purpose was to destroy the laboratories and take prisoner or kill those who had been building the suicide bombs and directing the suicide attacks. 
The Palestinian intifada describes itself as an armed struggle, an uprising. The word that describes the leaders and planners of such an armed struggle, in legal parlance, is "combatants." 
And international law could not be any more plain. On June 8, 1977, the Fourth Geneva Convention was updated. The document is called "Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts." 
Article 37 outlaws the use of civilian populations as a shield for military actions. It explicitly prohibits "the feigning of civilian, noncombatant status; and the feigning of protected status by the use of signs, emblems or uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict." 
What the leaders of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, Hamas and Islamic Jihad do is hide among civilian populations to make it as difficult as possible for their enemies to attack them. The Geneva Convention denounces this as "perfidy." 
Peter Bouckaert, a researcher at Human Rights Watch in New York who sneaked into Jenin on Thursday, told the Washington Post, "It's been incredibly difficult to tell the difference between fighters and civilians. If a combatant uses the civilian population as a shield in this way, the deaths incurred are the moral and legal responsibility of those who are hidings out in this grotesquely cowardly fashion. 
Previously, Palestinians and their apologists had claimed the Israelis were violating the Fourth Geneva Convention by refusing to allow ambulances operated by the Red Crescent Society to move freely between Israeli hospitals and the West Bank towns in which the incursions were taking place. 
Article 38 specifically addresses the ambulance issue: "It is prohibited to make improper use of the distinctive emblem of the red cross, red crescent or red lion and sun." 
And this is precisely what the Palestinians have done. The Israelis have stopped and searched ambulances emblazoned with the Red Crescent and found suicide belts hidden in them. One of these incidents, on March 27, was captured on videotape. 
Using this internationally accepted symbol as a diversionary tactic - in essence turning ambulances into tanks - the Palestinians thus bear the moral and legal responsibility under international law for the Israeli refusal to allow the free conduct of Red Crescent vehicles. 
Anti-zionist violators of international law - the criminals in this war - are the Palestinians who devised these shameful tactics. </b><br>

<b>Hi Karen and thanks for your input. I may add that Israelis also want to live in peace but the unresonable policies of their own successive governments are pushing them into self destruction. As for my arguments with Peter, I need to remind you and everyone that the first time I came here, I was concerned about the Palestinian cause but I got interested in Peter's logic of pretending working for peace, while doing nothing for. Again, a state based on an ideology, itself based on taking someone else' land, cannot be viewed as seeking peace. Accordingly, if Zionism works for peace as Peter says, it's got to be a one-sided peace that we are talking about, that of Israel. This is why Peter, I cannot put in the same balance a criminal governement and a freedom fighting entity. As a matter of fact, I never considered through my life that Vietnamese, Timorese, Kashmiri, Algerians or Indians among others, were terrorists while fighting in their respective war for independance, because they're the occupied not the other way around...and that's the same view now in Palestine. As for Baseball, my favorite birds (O's) always remind me of Peace and wish they could turn their season around.</b><br>

<b>I agree with all. Let's forget about terminology. Who cares about the meaning of words? I am more interested that suffering should end, whatever name one calls it. I think we should also avoid using words such as "Palestinian", "Israeli" etc. Those are labels which people have different opinions on meaning. We were all once a baby in the womb. How does one define the correct label? What intrests me is that where humans are suffering, that suffering should end. The name we attach to those people or the word for the suffering is secondary. It does not interest me if A is hurting B if it is because A is a zionist, or A is anti-zionist. What interests me is that A should stop. Mutually, if X is giving to the poor and feeding others and promoting peace, it does not interest me if X is doing these good deeds because X is a zionist or an anti-zionist. What does interest me is that X continues and we learn from X. Let's all promote peace and forget about words if we don't know the true meaning. It is humans who invented these words anyway.

<b>Hi Lucid
What interests me (whatever word one wishes to call it) I think every person guilty of crimes should be held accountable. I do not believe one is a pre-requisite to the other. If A and B are guilty, A and B should be held accountable. If one wishes to put one before the other, than it cannot be sincere. It is then to prove a point. If a few people are involved in a crime eg Sabra, they should ALL be held accountable. I never said one before the other. What I do say, is one should not only look at one and not the other, WHICHEVER GROUP IT IS. The one who is arguably responsible and the ones who commited the crime. They should all be held responsible. I don't think one is before the other. My question is why do you only look at Sharon and not those who did the deeds? I am saying they should ALL be tried. I never said one is before the other, or conventiently the ones I don't support. Bringing ALL GUILTY to justice is more important to me than the meaning of words. Let's all promote peace now. This site is about culture. Let us now stop squabbling, fighting over the meaning of a word, which clearly is controversial. (The fact that thousands have lots of opinions) Lets promote peace now!

If Lucid the non-zionist is such an angel, are you also upset about the people who actually carried out the act of Sabra/Shatila or is it only Sharon you want? Zionism is the most peaceful, anti-racist, caring, giving-to-the-poor, promoting understanding movement I have ever known. Ask 99% of Zionists. After 15 years as a staunch zionist, promoting understanding in the middle east, donating to the impoverished, trying to raise the standard of living for all, I'm not going to let some "Lucid" come from nowhere and lecture me what the word zionism means.

I don't think Sharon is an angel. Niether is Arafat. My proof of Arafat is not fraud, as it is directly from his lips. I am proud to be a zionist. zionism = peace. anti-zionism = racism. If no one believes me, go out and interbiew 100 zionists AT RANDOM, not conveniently chosen by me. The fact that 99% of zionists promote peace and hate racism and give to the needy, speaks more volume than anything I write here.

<b>Those people running this site, want cultural contributions. Here is one about culture, or lack thereof.
The following was written by an Arab journalist, Joseph Farah, who seems to 
be the lead man in the Internet-based conservative paper, WorldNetDaily.
******************************
I've been quiet since Israel erupted in fighting spurred by disputes over
the Temple Mount. Until now, I haven't even bothered to say, "See, I told
you
so." But I can't resist any longer. I feel compelled to remind you of the
column I wrote just a couple weeks before the latest uprising. Yeah, folks,  I
predicted it.
That's OK. Hold your applause. After all, I wish I had been wrong. More
than 600 people have been killed since the current fighting started. And for what?
If you believe what you read in most news sources, Palestinians want a
homeland and Muslims want control over sites they consider holy. Simple right?
Well, as an Arab-American journalist who has spent some time in the Middle
East dodging more than my share of rocks and mortar shells, I've got to tell
you that these are just phony excuses for the rioting, trouble-making and
land-grabbing. Isn't it interesting that prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war,
there was no serious movement for a Palestinian homeland?
"Well, Farah," you might say, "that was before the Israelis seized the West
Bank and Old Jerusalem." That's true. In the Six-Day War, Israel captured
Judea, Samaria and East Jerusalem. But they didn't capture these territories
from Yasser Arafat. They captured them from Jordan's King Hussein. I can't
help but wonder why all these Palestinians suddenly discovered their
national identity after Israel won the war.
The truth is that Palestine is no more real than Never-Never Land. The first
time the name was used was in 70 AD when the Romans committed genocide
against the Jews, smashed the Temple and declared the land of Israel would be
no more. From then on, the Romans promised, it would be known as Palestine.
The name was derived from the Philistines, a Goliathian people conquered by
the Jews centuries earlier. It was a way for the Romans to add insult to injury. 
They also tried to change the name of Jerusalem to Aelia Capitolina, but that had even less staying power.
Palestine has never existed--before or since--as an autonomous entity. It was
ruled alternately by Rome, by Islamic and Christian crusaders, by the Ottoman
Empire and, briefly, by the British after World War I. The British agreed to
restore at least part of the land to the Jewish people as their homeland.
There is no language known as Palestinian. There is no distinct Palestinian
culture. There has never been a land known as Palestine governed by
Palestinians. Palestinians are Arabs, indistinguishable from Jordanians
(another recent invention), Syrians, Lebanese, Iraqis, etc. Keep in mind
that the Arabs control 99.9 percent of the Middle East lands. Israel represents
one-tenth of 1 percent of the landmass. But that's too much for the Arabs.
They want it all. And that is ultimately what the fighting in Israel is about
today. Greed. Pride. Envy. Covetousness. No matter how many land
concessions the Israelis make, it will never be enough. What about Islam's holy sites?
There are none in Jerusalem. Shocked? You should be. I don't expect you
will ever hear this brutal truth from anyone else in the international media.
It's just not politically correct.
I know what you're going to say: "Farah, the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of
the Rock in Jerusalem represent Islam's third most holy sites." Not true. In
fact, the Koran says nothing about Jerusalem. It mentions Mecca hundreds of
times. It mentions Medina countless times. It never mentions Jerusalem.
With good reason. There is no historical evidence to suggest Mohammed ever
visited Jerusalem. So how did Jerusalem become the third holiest site of Islam?
Muslims today cite a vague passage in the Koran, the seventeenth Sura,
entitled "The Night Journey." It related that in a dream or a vision
Mohammed was carried by night "from the sacred temple to the temple that is most
remote, whose precinct we have blessed, that we might show him our
signs...."
In the seventh century, some Muslims identified the two temples mentioned
in this verse as being in Mecca and Jerusalem. And that's as close as Islam's
connection with Jerusalem gets -- myth, fantasy, wishful thinking.
Meanwhile, Jews can trace their roots in Jerusalem back to the days of Abraham.
The latest round of violence in Israel erupted when Likud Party leader
Ariel Sharon tried to visit the Temple Mount, the foundation of the Temple built
by Solomon. It is the holiest site for Jews. Sharon and his entourage were met
with stones and threats. I know what it's like. I've been there. Can you
imagine what it is like for Jews to be threatened, stoned and physically
kept out of the holiest site in Judaism?
So what's the solution to the Middle East mayhem? Well, frankly, I don't
think there is a man-made solution to the violence. But, if there is one,
it needs to begin with truth. Pretending will only lead to more chaos.
Treating a 5,000-year-old birthright backed by overwhelming historical and
archaeological evidence equally with illegitimate claims, wishes and wants
give diplomacy and peacekeeping a bad name."</b><br>

<b>Re to Marie-Jo : I'm living in South of France too (on the opposite side of the Mediterranean Sea, near by Perpignan) and I can tell you that we act in a similar way as you. We are very glad to notice that there are more and more persons supporting the suffering Palestinian people. Perpignan is not a very big town, and it was good to see that for the last demonstration, there were more than 600 persons. I hope that the next times there will be more and more to feel concerned ! I wish  you and your action to be successful in all what you are doing. Very sincerely greeting.</b><br>

<b>A combination of Arab rhetoric, threatening behavior and, ultimately, an act of war left Israel no choice but preemptive action. To do this successfully, Israel needed the element of surprise. Had it waited for an Arab invasion, Israel would have been at a potentially catastrophic disadvantage.
While Nasser continued to make speeches threatening war, Arab terrorist attacks grew more frequent. In 1965, 35 raids were conducted against Israel. In 1966, the number increased to 41. In just the first four months of 1967, 37 attacks were launched.5
Meanwhile, Syria's attacks on Israeli kibbutzim from the Golan Heights provoked a retaliatory strike on April 7, 1967, during which Israeli planes shot down six Syrian MiGs. Shortly thereafter, the Soviet Union-which had been providing military and economic aid to both Syria and Egypt-gave Damascus information alleging a massive Israeli military buildup in preparation for an attack. Despite Israeli denials, Syria decided to invoke its defense treaty with Egypt.
On May 15, Israel's Independence Day, Egyptian troops began moving into the Sinai and massing near the Israeli border. By May 18, Syrian troops were prepared for battle along the Golan Heights.
Nasser ordered the UN Emergency Force, stationed in the Sinai since 1956, to withdraw on May 16. Without bringing the matter to the attention of the General Assembly, as his predecessor had promised, Secretary-General U Thant complied with the demand. After the withdrawal of the UNEF, the Voice of the Arabs proclaimed (May 18, 1967):
As of today, there no longer exists an international emergency force to protect Israel. We shall exercise patience no more. We shall not complain any more to the UN about Israel. The sole method we shall apply against Israel is total war, which will result in the extermination of Zionist existence.
An enthusiastic echo was heard May 20 from Syrian Defense Minister Hafez Assad:
Our forces are now entirely ready not only to repulse the aggression, but to initiate the act of liberation itself, and to explode the Zionist presence in the Arab homeland. The Syrian army, with its finger on the trigger, is united....I, as a military man, believe that the time has come to enter into a battle of annihilation.7
On May 22, Egypt closed the Straits of Tiran to all Israeli shipping and all ships bound for Eilat. This blockade cut off Israel's only supply route with Asia and stopped the flow of oil from its main supplier, Iran. The following day, President Johnson expressed the belief that the blockade was illegal and unsuccessfully tried to organize an international flotilla to test it.
Nasser was fully aware of the pressure he was exerting to force Israel's hand. The day after the blockade was set up, he said defiantly: "The Jews threaten to make war. I reply: Welcome! We are ready for war."8
Nasser challenged Israel to fight almost daily. "Our basic objective will be the destruction of Israel. The Arab people want to fight," he said on May 27.9 The following day, he added: "We will not accept any...coexistence with Israel...Today the issue is not the establishment of peace between the Arab states and Israel....The war with Israel is in effect since 1948."10
King Hussein of Jordan signed a defense pact with Egypt on May 30. Nasser then announced:
The armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon are poised on the borders of Israel...to face the challenge, while standing behind us are the armies of Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait, Sudan and the whole Arab nation. This act will astound the world. Today they will know that the Arabs are arranged for battle, the critical hour has arrived. We have reached the stage of serious action and not declarations.11
President Abdur Rahman Aref of Iraq joined in the war of words: "The existence of Israel is an error which must be rectified. This is our opportunity to wipe out the ignominy which has been with us since 1948. Our goal is clear -- to wipe Israel off the map."12 On June 4, Iraq joined the military alliance with Egypt, Jordan and Syria.
The Arab rhetoric was matched by the mobilization of Arab forces. Approximately 250,000 troops (nearly half in Sinai), more than 2,000 tanks and 700 aircraft ringed Israel.13
By this time, Israeli forces had been on alert for three weeks. The country could not remain fully mobilized indefinitely, nor could it allow its sea lane through the Gulf of Aqaba to be interdicted. Israel's best option was to strike first.On June 5, the order was given to attack Egypt.</b><br>

<b>Who really cares about the human rights of Palestinian Arabs?
Syria, Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other Muslim nations have warned Israel, in various ways and with different degrees of intensity, over the Jewish state's alleged mistreatment of Palestinian Arabs.
There's one major problem with these threats. These nations have done less for Arab Palestinians than Israel has. 
The Jordan Times reports that "Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, who have long been denied many civil rights including the right to work, now face a new obstacle in their precarious lives."
Under a bill introduced by parliament earlier this year, Palestinian Arabs will be deprived of their right to own property. Those who already own property will not be able to pass it on to their children. Now just imagine if Israel passed such a law? Can you imagine the international outcry? What would the United Nations have to say about this? How long would it take to equate Zionism with racism again? How would the media establishment in the West view such a draconian ploy? Yet, this is happening in an Arab country virtually without comment - except here.
And take a look at the transparent rationale for this action in Lebanon, as described in the Jordan Times: "The Lebanese parliament passed the law on the grounds that it wants to protect the right of the Palestinian refugees to return eventually to their homes which they fled after the creation of the state of Israel on Palestinian lands in 1948."
Don't you love that? We are protecting your rights by denying your rights. Only in the Arab world could such hypocritical duplicity occur without international ridicule and universal denunciation.
Keep in mind that most Palestinian refugees today were born well after 1948. They never lived in the land called Palestine. And the reason is that their Arab neighbors have been so inhospitable to them. They have not allowed them to resettle because Arab leaders are determined to fan the flames of hate with Israel. They want to keep this scapegoat issue of a Palestinian homeland alive so that the Arab people don't turn their enmity toward their own leadership and begin questioning why they are deprived of their own human rights.
Lebanon, by the way, is a virtual client state of Syria. It is occupied by the Syrian army. No significant political decision is made in Beirut without the approval and direction of Damascus. And it is Damascus, more than any other Arab capital, that supports the Arab terror campaign in Israel, that undermines every attempt at peaceful reconciliation between Arab and Jew and that has orchestrated this strategy of actively denying Palestinians their human rights in the name of Palestinian human rights.
How bad is the situation in Lebanon? Here are more details as reported by the Jordan Times - not exactly a mouthpiece for the vast international Zionist conspiracy:
¤ Under the Lebanese labor law that governs foreigners, Palestinians are denied 74 forms of employment;
¤ Palestinians face tight exit and entry requirements;
¤ Palestinians in Lebanon are not allowed citizenship;
¤ Palestinians are confined to 12 camps with no medical, social or educational services from the government and are barred in some of those camps from building or even repairing homes. 
Some in Lebanon have even recognized the "racist" nature of this anti-Palestinian campaign - policies far worse than anything ever contemplated by Israel. 
Yet, more than half a million Syrians marched earlier this week in support of the Palestinian uprising in Israel, chastising the Jewish state for "Nazi and fascist" practices. Do those Syrian citizens have any idea of what kind of oppression Palestinian Arabs face next door in Lebanon? Do they have any idea that their government is directly supporting such policies? Are they aware that more Syrian troops are headed to Lebanon now to support the Beirut regime that has imposed such repressive measures?
Now any person who knows what zionism means, can tell you zionism is the most peaceful movement ever. The whole concept of zionism is to promote peace, save life and co-exist with others. Many people in the arab world have twisted zionism in to some type of "racist" movement.
Let us say the lie about zionism is true i.e. zionism is about hurting palestinians. In that case, Arab countries are bigger zionists than Israel. In reality, if more people were zionists, it would be a much better world. I plan to go and save as many lives as I can, that is why I'm proud to be a zionist.</b><br>

<b>Stone-throwing Palestinian youths ripped through the town of Ramallah yesterday in the first of two "days of rage" declared by Yassir Arafat's Fatah organisation. It will have been no trouble to recruit this rent-a-mob; there is rage to spare, after nearly six months of futile battling against Israeli occupation. But rage, the most nihilistic of impulses, has done nothing but harm to Palestinians. 
A few powerless people, as they mourn children killed in crossfire or pushed, like human shields, ahead of rioters attacking Israeli troops, are beginning to whisper the truth: that they are being deliberately exposed to danger and death, exploited by their own side's gunmen. 
As The Times reported yesterday from El Bireh, the Palestinian residential area where people's flats are daily used by snipers attacking a nearby Jewish settlement, locals have appealed to the gunmen not to expose their families to returning fire. 
For response, they get official banners acclaiming their dead infants as martyrs. They too hate Israel. But they do not want to be martyrs to an unending, unwinnable confrontation. They want to be left alone. 
These grieving voices should be heard, by their own leaders and by others. They are ignored. 
The European Union has had plenty to say about the damage inflicted by Israel's economic blockade and military roadblocks in the West Bank; But foreign leaders limply shrink from condemning the cynicism with which various Palestinian factional leaders, who themselves are in no firing line, have played upon popular fears and frustration. 
From Hamas and Fatah's increasingly militant Tanzim militia leaders, both out to destroy any chance of negotiated cohabitation in this wracked land, each Palestinian death is a weapon of war. 
But even Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian legislator who was once a moderate, has signed up to the politics of hate. This week she circulated an incendiary "open letter" purporting to be from Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Prime Minister. "To every man, woman and child in the Palestinian territories", it said, "you are my target; you will be made to suffer; and you shall pay for the original crime of being a Palestinian." 
This crude forgery is black propaganda and bad satire. What good can Ms Ashrawi think to do by inciting the most violent to fresh extremes? Six months after it started, the "al-Aqsa intifada" has presented Palestinians with a grim set of accounts. Death has claimed at least 345 Palestinians, 13 Israeli Arabs and 65 other Israelis; hundreds more have been maimed. 
The Palestinian central bank calculates that economic activity, already feeble, has halved.  
There is still a lasting evil, the brutalisation of children of both sexes who are trained and indoctrinated at terrorist boot camps before being used as expendable cover for gunmen. 
"Closure does not frighten us", shouted protesters yesterday. 
It should. Civilians are paying an unendurable price - children first. Tense Israeli troops have too often shot before asking questions; but the harsher truth is that those children should be kept far from trouble, not pushed towards it. 
At his first full Cabinet this week, Mr Sharon promised to ease restrictions on most Palestinians and to punish only those responsible for violence. That must be right. It is easier said than done, certainly while Mr Arafat sticks to the official Fatah line that all Israel understands is violence. 
There are risks for Israel in lifting restrictions around towns such as Bethlehem and Hebron at a time when Fatah is calling on Arabs to join "the beginning of war" and Saddam Hussein is training thousands of volunteers to send. Israel must maintain its vigilance so long as Mr Arafat scorns the compromises that would make for a better, freer Palestine. How can zionist peace prevail?</b><br>

<b>There is overwhelming proof by zionists and non-zionists  of Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat’s direct involvement in terrorism. 
Arafat has always been a terrorist. His Palestine Liberation Organization — founded in 1964 (three years before the "occupation" that supposedly provided the pretext for anti-Israel terrorism) — had terror as its raison d’être from its first day. He pioneered the hijacking of planes and the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians, especially women and children. It is these deeds that contradict everything that zionism stands for.
But once he signed the Oslo peace accords in 1993, all that was supposedly in the past. Since that day, Arafat has been treated like a statesman by the world press.
The following 8 1/2 years provided plenty of reasons to question that status, but nothing seems to have shaken that mindset on the part of most of the world’s diplomatic and press corps. 
But unlike some of its recent predecessors, the current government of Israel has had the bad manners to compile a dossier of damning evidence that shows Palestinian terrorism is not the work of a few extremists, as we have been told. 
Instead, the systematic terror campaign that has taken the lives of hundreds of Israelis in the last 19 months can be traced directly back to Yasser Arafat. He is not just the one who has incited violence with hateful speech or fomented it by encouraging "jihad" and mourning the loss of "martyrs" who murdered Israelis. 
The vast store of documents uncovered in the recent sweep of terrorist offices in the territories show that Arafat is also the paymaster and coordinator of terrorism. 
Unfortunately, the truth is also considered irrelevant when it comes to our Saudi "allies." The same treasure trove of Palestinian records revealed that the Saudi royal family and government has been funneling millions of dollars to the terrorist infrastructure, specifically funding the families of suicide bombers, whom the Saudis prefer to call "martyrs." 
This evidence is also ignored by Washington, which has deluded itself into imagining that it can enlist the funders of terrorism as their allies in a war against its perpetrators.  
The documents also show that the Palestinian Authority, like the Saudis, is directly linked with the Islamic fundamentalist groups — Hamas and Islamic Jihad — that Western leaders have been entreating Arafat to suppress. The P.A. is itself an infrastructure of terror whose full resources were directed toward terror. 
But Washington’s response to this air-tight case against Arafat has been a shrug and a yawn. 
"At the end of the day, Israel cannot choose the Palestinians leaders, and it must deal with the Palestinian Authority." is the American response.
The P.A. is dedicated to terrorism — and a raft of incidents, such as the Karine A arms-smuggling ship and nine years worth of terrorism, do objectively prove this — then what will such dealings with the P.A. accomplish? 
After all, hadn’t Arafat renounced terror every time he signed a peace agreement with Israel. But as Israeli concessions were transformed into more power for him, his violations of the ban on terror only grew more and more brazen. 
Every time he was caught in these lies, he was rewarded with more pressure from the international community on Israel, not him. Zionism would never promote lying. Everything that has happened since 1993 has convinced him that terror pays handsomely. 
To understand this mindset is to reveal the malevolence of those who tell us Arafat’s criminal behavior is irrelevant. 
Because if the original Oslo agreements and Ehud Barak’s zionist offer of a state comprising virtually all of the territory Israel gained in 1967 didn’t satisfy Arafat or deter him from anti-zionist terror, then the inescapable conclusion is that his goal is the elimination of the Jewish state, no matter how constricted its borders might be.
Thus, Israel’s greatest problem may not be in convincing the world to see Arafat as a terrorist but in asking it to think seriously about what his goals really are, whether he pursues them fair means or foul. 
Ignoring the truth about Arafat isn’t just a diplomatic courtesy. It is a statement that murder of innocent, is nothing more than international bad manners — and no crime. 
For the "senior officials" patrolling the corridors of the State Department and the White House — not to mention the United Nations — giving Arafat a "Get Out of Jail Free Card" in spite of the innocent blood that is plainly visible on his hands is just the business of statecraft as they try to eliminate an irritant to their plans for war on Iraq. 
Americans should realize that the cost of this madness won’t be born by Israelis alone. 
As momentum for the next round of "peace" negotiations builds, we are increasingly told that American peacekeeping troops, or "monitors," will be necessary to seal the deal. In the future, it may well be Americans whose lives will be forfeited as Arafat and his criminal band violate their next treaty. Nor can we be sure that future Palestinian or Saudi "martyrs" won’t again target American cities as they push us toward new rounds of appeasement. </b><br>

<b>Examples of Palestinian violations are numerous, but here are just a few examples: 
Failure to hand over Palestinian terrorists to Israeli authorities. 
Failure to amend the PLO Charter calling for the destruction of Israel. 
Open calls for Jihad (Holy War) by Arafat (in Arabic, not in English) against Israel. 
Palestinian Police shooting Israeli soldiers, unprovoked, on a "tunnel pretext". 
Desecration of Jewish Holy Places, such as Joseph's tomb in Nablus. 
Why were USA, Brzezinski, Baker and Company also silent about the Muslim States arming themselves with weapons of mass destruction? Why not condemn their open threats to wipe out Israel? Why be silent about their desire to commit genocide? 
Why not condemn brutal dictatorships in Syria, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Saudi Arabia? Are they not a threat to peace, according to you, Brzezinski, Baker and Company? 
Why are Arab and Iranian missiles (purchased from North Korea and China) armed with Chemical, Biological (and possibly Nuclear) warheads not a problem to you champions of the peace process? 
Don't you, Brzezinski, Baker &amp; Company know that the ultimate goal in the Muslim mind is the destruction of Israel? Don't you know, from their own statements, that the PLO &amp; Hamas don't want peace, they want the genocide of the Jews? 
Didn't the CIA, nor your State Dept. Arabists, tell you what the Palestinians say in Arabic? They say "First we kill the Saturday people, then we kill the Sunday people. Kill the Jews, wherever you find them." 
But with Arab oil wealth propping up weak American banks, what are New World Order buffs like you to do, Mr. President? With Islamic terror spreading to America, what are Trilateral Commission strategists like Brzezinski &amp; Baker to say? 
The list is actually endless. If one went into any mosque at RANDOM, one will not hear about "peace" or "compromise", but "holy Jehad" and "murder every Jew".
and "We will destroy Israel".
This is some of the hate spread by the anti-zionists.

<b>Lucid
1)I clicked "send" a few times by mistake, you may by all means delete two of my entries.
2)This conference is very important, as many of the worst regimes in the world were there to charge Israel.
It just so happens, I will bet that if you took a survey of these "refuseniks", you will see that most see themselves as zionists. I will bet you. Lucid must be a staunch zionist if she supports these soldiers.
Mutually, Lucid quotes anecdotes of soldiers who did not behave accordingly, labelling them zionists. Therefore those who did behave accordingly (the majority) must be non-zionists.
Conclusion?
Most soldiers who participated were non-zionists
Those who refused were zionists.
There many soldiers who refuse. There also many who did not refuse. They say they are prepared to risk their own lives to save Palestinian life to remove the terrorists.
Most did not behave as described by Lucid. 
The "massacre" in Jenin, started off as 1000 people, then dropped to 200, then became 50, of which a few were civilian.

90% of the demonstrations there were about Palestine. The behaviour of the Muslim extremist demonstraters were despicable. They flaunted MANY swastikas.

Most Palestine supporters there were not fighting racism, but promoting it. It was pure hate. Some one would scream out "In the name of Palestine, kill every zionist." Thousands would shout "death death death to zionism". The vulgar hate they promoted were terrible. They were not making any political statement about Palestinian rights, but promoting pure hate. Their behaviour was despicable (in the tens of thousands) far beyond a mere demonstration. Even if I don't agree with you Lucid, you talking like a gentleman/woman (seeing that I can't see you). You not typing in the guestbook "May every zionist be skinned alive, death to them, death death death". That is the difference between how you state your opinion and the thousands of Palestine supporters at that conference.
What was the result of the Islamic extremists rallying there?
Thousands upon thousans of people watching turned against Palestine. Countless people who knew about the conflict but not much sais "if that is what Palestine is about, stuff Palestine". Others said "Now I understand Israel,  Israel is dealing with abnormal people. The Muslim extremists there started unprecedented hate for Palestine. Thousands of little kids have since been taught to hate Palestine.
Many people in the international community who were paying attention to that conference, also lost all respect for Palestine.
Those people who turned towards Palestine, it was from a militant hateful perspective, rather than understanding the situation.

That is the difference between how you state your opinion and the thousands of Palestine supporters at that conference.
What was the result of the Islamic extremists rallying there?
Thousands upon thousans of people watching turned against Palestine. Countless people who knew about the conflict but not much sais "if that is what Palestine is about, stuff Palestine". Others said "Now I understand Israel,  Israel is dealing with abnormal people. The Muslim extremists there started unprecedented hate for Palestine. Thousands of little kids have since been taught to hate Palestine.
Many people in the international community who were paying attention to that conference, also lost all respect for Palestine.
Those people who turned towards Palestine, it was from a militant hateful perspective, rather than understanding the situation.
Naturally, you would not read about it. I am not surprised, an event that startled people all over the world, you would not hear about it, from your reading material. 
By YOUR definition of zionism, to put down Palestine, than many of those Muslim extremist demonstraters were zionists. They did not merely put down Palestine. They actually taught thousands to hate Palestine. I am not Jewish or Moslem. I do know that I have met many South Africans here, Jewish and Christian who told me that after that conferance, they don't want to hear the word "Palestine" again. Naturally, you may think I'm trying to be funny or cute, so why don't you research this conferance in your own time?</b><br>

<b>Well Lucid, every Palestinian leader I have seen admit there was no massacre in Jenin, including the ambassador to the UN. Actually they did say there was a massacre, but they changed their definition of the word massacre to justify their claim. I wont argue with them. And no, zionism is not a propaganda tool. Teaching me to hear every perspective, listen to every side, hear as many views as possible pro this side, pro that side is not propaganda. You the one who seems to have restricted reading/listening.

<b>Peter, the words of a man cannot be taken for being the voice of the government. I could also pick a couple of US senators or congressmen and tell you that they are racist against Palestinians when calling upon deporting them out of their lands (on NBC in one case); yet, it's not the US government's position. Having said that, I do concede that in Europe, France, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland or Belgium among others have a more just view of the conflict than Germany (for historical reasons) or the UK (for being the obeying child of U. Sam policies). The problem is that zionists always accuse people of being against them should they be fair...!!!..another propaganda tool to my opinion. I must here note that the legal case against war criminal Sharon for Sabra &amp; Chatila will be examined today in a Brussels court and we hope that justice will prevail. As for Jenine, it doesn't matter who said what: until a fair investigation is not carried out and a count of the remaining camp population versus the original UN lists is not done, the burden of suspicion will remain on Israel because of it's long record of human abuses and atrocities against Palestinians. Btw, Swiss TV will air in few days a program on Israel hidden nuclear warheads, another face of this outlaw state.

<b>While the world remains fixated on how to revive the "peace process" between the Israelis and the Palestinians, time might be better spent understanding Yasser Arafat's extraordinary blunder in totally destroying his own Palestinian Authority's bargaining position. 
There have been many confrontations between Arafat and his hated Israeli "occupiers." But this time, after rejecting the extraordinary opportunity offered by the previous Israeli government under then Prime Minister Ehud Barak to gain 97 percent of the West Bank territories at the 1998 Wye River conference, Arafat's arrogance caused him to lose his balance. 
The January attempt to use the freighter Karine A to sneak 50 tons of arms from Iran into PA territory and the unprecedented murder of Israeli Cabinet Minister Rehavem Zeevi last fall made it impossible for the current Israeli government of Ariel Sharon to consider the past year and a half of Palestinian terrorist attacks "intifada as usual," as Arafat confidently believed it would. 
And in this new context, Arafat's use of suicide bombers became excessive and intolerable, bringing down a heavy Israel Defense Force response he had clearly not expected. Surprisingly, observers still fail to understand the magnitude of the success of Sharon's military and political assault on Arafat's PA. 
While international observers continued to wring their hands over alleged "war crimes" in Jenin, they missed the point -- again. What was really remarkable was how, once Arafat had been engaged and isolated in Ramallah, his forces were defeated in detail by the IDF with both efficiency and a minimal loss of life. How that happened is worth examining. 
Pre-positioned material that had taken years to accumulate in the PA territories has now been destroyed by the IDF. The speed of modern warfare no longer allows anyone the time to declare war and rearm at their leisure. After all the lack of pre-positioned troops and equipment has delayed the pending U.S. offensive against Iraq, just as it did in the Gulf War in 1991. 
Since the PA is more of a guerilla force it is helpful to recall that the Viet Cong had to infiltrate all the materials they used in their massive engagement in the Tet Offensive in 1968 over many months, just as Arafat's PA had to. Once it was used up, the Viet Cong were no longer a force to be reckoned with and disappeared. 
And unfortunately for Arafat, the PA "civil authority" centers he thought untouchable, like his headquarters at Ramallah where he stockpiled some of his most sophisticated weapons, such as rockets, mines, and heavy weapons, were carefully cleared out by the IDF amid the twittering of Europeaceniks for Israeli desecration of these shrines of democratic government. 
Arafat's Palestinians no doubt have still cached some light weapons and ammunition, they can use for hit-and-run raiding and the occasional funeral fusillade. But the days of a significant threat from the PA are over for now. It will take them years to get back to the supply levels they had before Sharon's troops moved in on them. 
Perhaps most importantly, detailed records at the PA headquarters in Ramallah and district centers provided invaluable intelligence on PA order of battle and arrangements with collateral organizations such as the Hezbollah and al Qaida. And with th ese records in hand, cadres were located, captured, interrogated and their effectiveness destroyed or severely limited. This now leaves the Israelis free to go after the Syrian-supported Hezbollah and their occupied province of Lebanon with little fear of being outflanked by the PA. 
The Palestinians, of course, have been used by Arab powers from the Saudis to the Libyans, Syrians, and Iraqi for 40 years as a way to throw U.S. policy off balance by destabilizing Israel. 
But now this option will not be open to Iraq's Saddam Hussein as the American assault opens on his regime. 
If Saddam wants to send an explosive missile into Israel he will have to make that decision on his own and take the consequences. He has pretty much lost the option of a more sympathetic explosive package delivered by Arafat[Thomas Lipscomb] , like a teenaged girl carrying a bomb . Now there will only be a limited number of Palestinian martyrs suited up with bombs able to make it to their targets in Israel. 
At a meeting at the Council on Foreign Relations this spring, two former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff, Gens. John Vessey and John Shalikashvili snorted with derision at the naiveté of questions about the "terrible casualties" being experienced in Bush's "War Against Terror." And, of course, compared to World War II and Vietnam, the U.S. casualties in Bush's campaign in Afghanistan and Sharon's in the PA territories barely total the crash of a commuter airliner. 
Ironically, both the Bush Administration's detractors and supporters miss the real nature of this war. It is not the war the Left wishes to view as destroying indigenous Islamic regimes in favor of American globalization. Any products in this region like oil were already totally accessible to global markets well before it began and continue to be. 
Nor is it the war the Right hopes will replace tin-pot dictatorships with more democratic governments. America's ally, Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf, just provided a helpful reminder of that as he neatly reinstalled himself with no opposition. 
What the world is seeing is America's first "oriental war." An Antonine emperor of Rome or a British Viceroy of India would recognize it instantly. 
It is not necessary to govern Parthia or Afghanistan or Kaffiristan. It is only necessary to make sure Parthia or Afghanistan do not have the power to disturb areas of strategic importance. 
Always use local troops like the Northern Alliance or the Israelis for the dirty work, so the locals keep focused on the benefits of imperial alliances and the fruits of provincial politics. Only deploy imperial troops in crushing force when a major threat is encountered. And with a lot of lies, the liberal use of bribery, and a surprisingly few soldiers, it is possible to play this game for centuries. 
The Wall Street Journal began to wake up and smell the coffee with an editorial called "The Bush Two Step" in which its editors actually allowed themselves to dare hope what pundits kept calling Bush's "shattered Middle-Eastern policy" might be diabolically clever. There is no better evidence than Secretary of State Colin Powell's so-called "failed trip" to the Middle East. If two of Arafat's suicide bombers had to succeed in killing Israeli civilians, it is hard to imagine a better timing for Israel than while an American secretary of state was waiting patiently to meet with PA President Arafat for "peace negotiations." 
What could poor distraught Powell do but turn away for the cameras, more in sorrow than in anger, unable "under the circumstances" to meet with Arafat? And with all that extra time on his hands why shouldn't he head back for another session with Sharon's government to plan on the next "helpful" IDF withdrawal from some Palestinian town they had been over with a fine tooth comb, and the next "unhelpful" pacification of another, with appropriate cooing and tut-tutting dubbed in? 
But instead of appropriate howls of cynical laughter, the world press indulged in another analysis of their favorite ongoing soap opera -- "Man of Peace" Powell being undercut by "Man of War" Paul Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense at the Pentagon. The Bush policy is no less deceptive than bombing aspirin factories in the Sudan. It is just a heck of a lot more effective. 
The essence of understanding "oriental war" is watching what the participants do rather than what they say -- a talent lacking in journalists and intellectuals with a primary talent for arguing over the parsing of political statements only they take seriously. 
New York Timesman Thomas Friedman's much-debated "message from Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia," Bush's criticism of Sharon's invasion of the PA territory, and threats against Israel from the European Union and the United Nations have one thing in common: they are all irrelevant. And the more irrelevant they are, the angrier journalists and intellectuals get at being ignored in their observations. 
Concerns that Israel might assassinate the imprisoned Arafat in Ramallah show how totally the West misunderstands the nature of oriental war. In this worldview for centuries it was regarded as far more useful to simply blind and castrate an opposing leader and leave him in place as a reminder to his people of their powerlessness. It still is. Arafat was already blind or he wouldn't have blundered into initiating the castration of his own power. 
And why ever would the Israelis want to kill him now? Arafat now is a figure of total ridicule to both his enemies and his allies. What better evidence than the casual ease with which both President Bush and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah had Sharon agree to release Arafat during a meeting in Crawford, Texas, devoted to weightier matters? 
And now, with the cage door of his Ramallah prison wide open, with Arafat "freed" at last, and his "martyrdom" a hollow joke, Arafat still sits inside, a stunned old man. No one knows more than he how irrelevant he has become. </b><br>

<b>Yasser Arafat and his "Palestinian" cohort are among the best liars in the world.  While telling Western press they want peace, Arafat and his people tell Arabs of their vision of conquering Israel and creating (yet) another Muslim state.  This is the ultimate objective of Arafat:
"We Palestinians will take over everything, including all of Jerusalem....All the rich Jews who will get compensation will travel to America....We of the PLO will now concentrate all our efforts on splitting Israel psychologically into two camps. Within five years we will have six to seven million Arabs living in the West Bank and in Jerusalem....You understand that we plan to eliminate the State of Israel and establish a purely Palestinian State....I have no use for Jews; they are and remain Jews. We now need all the help we can get from you in our battle for a united Palestine under total Arab-Muslim domination!" - Yasser Arafat, January 30, 1996, (Speech) "The Impending Total Collapse of Israel", Stockholm, Sweden (1,2)
Is it a wonder why Israelis are so skeptical about making a "just and lasting peace" with the Yasser Arafat, the "president" of the Palestinian authority?  Having signed the Oslo Accords, one would assume that Arafat is a man committed to peace.  However, he has shown that this is far from the case - he has rejected peace proposals, he propagates hatred against Jews in his media and he keeps his "Palestinian gunmen" well armed and trained.  Mr. Arafat has not only discussed his goals in closed meetings, but he has enshrined these goals in the Constitution of the his Fateh faction:
Some of Yasser Arafat's goals, as per the Constitution of the Fateh faction, which he leads:
Article (12) Complete liberation of Palestine, and eradication of Zionist economic, political, military and cultural existence.
Article (19) Armed struggle is a strategy and not a tactic, and the Palestinian Arab People's armed revolution is a decisive factor in the liberation fight and in uprooting the Zionist existence, and this struggle will not cease unless the Zionist state is demolished and Palestine is completely liberated. 
But that's not it!  Have you seen Yasser Arafat's goals, as per the PLO's 1974 Phased Plan?  Never having been revoked, this Phased Plan calls for declaration of independence on any land given over by Israel.  The new independent state would be used as a launching ground for attacks against Israel.  Sound familiar? 
Israeli Complicity in Arab Terror
Of course, in this situation, Israel is not innocent.  The left-wing political parties in Israel and organizations like "Peace Now" support Arab terror.  Don't believe it?  Read "Feeding the Mouth that Bites" to understand. 
Had enough?  There's still more...
Jihad for Kids, NBC News Commentary and Hatred Now are three poignant videos showing that the Palestinians are not working for peace.  These are "must see" videos, which will help you understand why most Israelis don't see Arafat and his cronies as partners for peace.  
Also, in case you missed it, the Palestinian National Authority State Information Service had a map on their website, depicting their version of Palestine.  You may be surprised what you see.  The map indicates the real Palestinian goals, but since it was a little too provocative, it was taken down days after it went up.

<b>I am a zionist. This means I listen to every side equally. After listening to ALL the evidence, the fact remains, there was no massacre in Jenin. Nothing even close, nothing anywhere near approaching "atrocities," the term used more universally — not limited to events in Jenin — as it appears in the resolution drawn up by Arab nations and presented for approval to the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, urging a condemnation of Israel's conduct during its military deployment in the West Bank over recent weeks. 
Because the 189-country assembly has regularly, routinely, passed such resolutions aimed squarely at Israel, there's no reason to believe this overture will be squelched, resulting in yet another Arab-centric swipe at a nation that continues to stick in their collective craw; a nation they can't crush by conventional military means, by terrorist tactics, by oil embargo or by diplomatic bullying.
Although the Jenin conclusion was formulated in a published report from Human Rights Watch that sounds downright ticked about having to exculpate Israel of crimes against humanity in the Palestinian refugee camp (and Palestinian terrorist haven)  its contents have been only grudgingly circulated by an international media that must bear much of the blame for rushing to indictment, having been completely suckered by second-hand accounts of what had transpired.
For weeks, Israel's military had been condemned, portrayed as no better than the Lebanese Christian Phalangists who committed mass murder in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in 1982, or the ethnic-cleansing militias in Kosovo. 
It is always tempting for some elements to believe the worst of Israel and to throw themselves into convincing the rest of the world, whilst masquerading as objective correspondents or activists who claim, piously, no more than a just resolution for Palestinians.
According to many non-zionist reports, hundreds upon hundreds were said to have been killed in Jenin, buried in mass graves by Israelis who were scrambling to hide the evidence of their depravity. No such graves were ever uncovered.
Now even the U.N. has confirmed only 52 died during the eight days of fighting inside Jenin. Human Rights Watch puts the civilian toll at 22, though most of those probably lost their lives when buildings crumbled during the assault.  Buildings demolished after Israeli troops repeatedly called upon those inside to come out — or when booby mines planted by Palestinian militants were tripped.
Some of those hidden bombs contained as much as 110 kilograms of explosives. 
This predictable admonishment of Israel further justifies its refusal to allow a U.N. fact-finding inquiry into Jenin, after originally expressing support for such an investigation, one which had been strongly advocated by the United States.
In sifting through the ruins of Jenin, everybody had got it wrong, save for the Israeli commanders who insisted throughout that they had done all they could to limit Palestinian casualties.
Indeed, the Israelis themselves lost 23 men, with an additional 75 wounded. Yet Human Rights Watch, while conceding that Palestinian gunmen "did endanger Palestinian civilians in the camp by using it as a base for planning and launching attacks, using indiscriminate tactics such as planting improved explosive devices within the camp, and intermingling with the civilian population during armed conflict," still essentially blames Israel for all that ensued.
On the subject of a U.N. inquiry, Israel had worried from the get-go that its operations in Jenin and elsewhere in the West Bank would not be scrutinized within the obvious context of a military manoeuvre — army versus gunmen, many of whom were hiding behind the skirts of Palestinian women — but as a bullying tactic by an assailant bristling with modern weaponry against a cowering civilian populace. Nowhere in the inquiry as envisioned by the U.N. would there have been a contextual acknowledgment of the umpteen suicide bombings that had preceded the military incursions, nor of the terrorist cells operating with impunity inside Jenin, nor of the broader anti-terrorism crusade that is being led by the U.S., which has not been subjected to a review or U.N. investigation for the continuing military campaign in Afghanistan.
If Israel had originally behaved like a country with something to hide in the rubble of Jenin, not allowing swift access to the camp by reporters or human rights agencies, it was precisely because Israeli authorities understand they will always be held to a higher, even unobtainable, standard. This is simply Israel's reality and always has been so. By the same philosophy, those who weep for Palestinian lives can barely squeeze out a tear for Israeli civilians blown to bits by homicide bombers serving their ultra-righteous anti-zionist cause. Another bomber struck recently in the Israeli town of Rishon Letzion, reportedly killing 15 people at a nightclub.
The basic operating premise of those who would judge Israel starts from this central tenet: justifiable Palestinian grievances, which mitigate all crimes and inherently support — despite the requisite disclaimer — violent means to achieve political ends.
Richard Falk, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, was a member of a human rights inquiry launched a year ago by the U.N. Human Rights Commission to examine the escalating violence engendered by the second intifada. Falk writes, without apology, that the resistance gradually ran out of military options as it faced Israel's "sophisticated weapons of warfare," and thus ultimately was left only with the recourse of suicide bombers: "Our report fully supported this line of interpretation in its study of the second intifada, as did the overwhelming majority of the security council membership. The basic conclusion of these efforts at impartial understanding was that Israel was mainly responsible for the escalations, and that its tactics of response involved massive violations of international human law."
This is the "impartial understanding" that Israel resisted in Jenin.
I, for one, do not blame Israel or for their refusal or for Jenin. I would never continually favour one side as that contradicts what zionism stands for. This time however, I cannot blame Israel.</b><br>

<b>- YEHIDA MASSACRE: 13 December 1947: men of the Arab village of Yehiday (near Petah Tekva, the first Zionist settlement to be established) met at the local coffee house when they saw a British Army patrol enter the village, they were reassured espeically that Jewish terrorists had murdered 12 Palestinians the previous day. The four cars stopped in front of the cafe house and out stepped men dressed in khaki uniforms and steel helmets. However, it soon became apparent that they had not come to protect the villagers. With machine guns they sprayed bullets into the crowd gathered in the coffee house. Some of the invaders placed bombs next to Arab homes while other disguised terrorists tossed grenades at civilians. For a while it seemed as if the villagers would be annihilated but soon a real British patrol arrived to foil the well organized killing raid. The death toll of 7 Arab civilans could have been much higher. Earlier the same day 6 Arabs were killed and 23 wounded when home made bombs were tossed at a crowd of Arabs standing near the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem.

<b>Palestinian Television continued over the weekend to re-broadcast excerpts from a Friday sermon in the Zayed bin Sultan Aal Nahyan mosque in Gaza. Translation supplied by The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI): 
"The Jews are Jews, whether Labor or Likud... They do not have any moderates or any advocates of peace. They are all liars... O brother believers, the criminals, the terrorists are the Jews, who have butchered our children, orphaned them, widowed our women and desecrated our holy places and sacred sites. They are the 
terrorists. They are the ones who must be butchered and killed, as Allah the Almighty said: 'Fight them: Allah will torture them at your hands, and will humiliate them and will help you to overcome them, and will relieve the minds of the believers... The cost and the dowry of this bride, the dowry of this paradise, is that we fight in the path of Allah, and kill and be killed. 
"Allah has purchased from the believers their persons and their property in return for the promise that they shall have paradise, for they fight in the cause of Allah, and they slay the enemy and are 
slain. This is a promise that He [Allah] has made incumbent upon Himself, as set out in the Torah, the Gospel, and the Koran. The 
Jews are the allies of the Christians, and the Christians are the allies of the Jews, despite the enmity that exists between them. 
The enmity between the Jews and the Christians is deep, but all of them are in agreement against the monotheists against those who say, 'There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger,'that is they are against you, O Muslims. 
"Even if an agreement of Gaza is signed - we shall not forget Haifa, and Acre, and the Galilee, and Jaffa, and the Triangle and 
the Negev, and the rest of our cities and villages. It is only a matter of time... Have no mercy on the Jews, no matter where they are, in any country. Fight them, wherever you are. Wherever you meet 
them, kill them. Wherever you are, kill those Jews and those Americans who are like them!"

<b>All my life I was very much a zionist. As zionism teaches tolerance and understanding for all, I was keenly supportive of the Palestinian cause. No more. Maybe nevermore.
It has become impossible to separate Palestinian society — beggared as it has become over three generations of statelessness — from Palestinian diabolism, driven by a leadership that's embraced and aggrandized the terrorist tactics and contempt for human life in which the Palestine Liberation Organization was forged. And if the ultra-militant descendants of the PLO have now gone beyond the criminal bounds of what even Yasser Arafat can stomach — so that he appears enfeebled and compromising to hate-engorged Palestinian youth, the gullible idealists willing to sacrifice their own lives at the behest of their recruiters — the chairman has only himself to blame. Arafat, a man defined by duplicity, cannot now offer unconvincing sympathy for the victims of homicide bombers.
These are empty words and incredulous sentiments, spoken at this juncture to salvage his own devalued currency as extremists — or what we, non-Palestinians, consider extremists — contrive to torch any peace negotiations with Israel, as they did so grotesquely on Tuesday by sending out yet another human bomb to do his wretched business even as President Ariel Sharon was sitting down with President George W. Bush in the White House, together groping toward some starting premise for compromise.
Message taken.
The massacre at Rishon Letzion was as much about discrediting Arafat as it was a reminder that organizations such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Al Aqsa Brigades have absolutely no interest in securing a Palestinian state if it means also the survival of Israel. Arafat had his chance, numerous chances, to ensure the interminable conflict would not come to this. He rejected those opportunities, in the process stoking ever-more unacceptable objectives, warped visions, for the Palestinian populace. How can he now be taken aback by the pipe dreams he encouraged and the environment of terror he fostered?
"I have issued my orders ... to confront and prevent any terror attacks on Israeli civilians no matter which Palestinian factions stand behind them," Arafat said Wednesday night. "We all condemn these attacks completely."
He does no such thing, and apparently nor do a great number of Palestinians. And because they are willing to accept murders upon murders on their behalf, these Palestinians have proven themselves unworthy of the state they covet. They can't see beyond the paramount imperative of their own cause, have become utterly coarsened to the villainies inflicted on Israelis, have reached such heights of deranged righteousness that they danced in the streets of Ramallah when the World Trade Center collapsed and took Osama bin Laden to their breast for having the gumption that Arafat lacked.
No pretence of dialogue for bin Laden, no supplicant's diplomacy — just a fist in America's gut, the kind of reeling blow Palestinian militants would dearly love to deliver to Israel. Alas, for the present they must satisfy themselves with scatter-shot suicide bombings. An unwise undertaking, however. The Rishon Letzion strike, committed by a suicide bomber who'd apparently set out from Gaza, will now probably provoke Israel to aim a military thrust that way. More military reserves were called up yesterday and a retaliatory mission is expected.
Evoking an old Hebrew adage, Sharon made this vow before hastily departing Washington: "He who rises up to kill us, we will pre-empt him and kill him first."
Palestinians may have been victims of clumsy geopolitics once. But victimhood has settled in their bones and metastasized in the more than half-century since the creation of Israel so that it has become their singular and only identity. For evidence, one need only look at Bethlehem, where Palestinians — and foolish self-proclaimed peace activists rushing to give them moral succour, initiating a round of cellphone interviews with accommodating journalists — have made heroes and darlings out of gunmen holed up in the Church of the Nativity.
On the streets of Bethlehem, there was dismay that Arafat had approved a scheme that would have seen a sizable clutch of those gunmen exiled to Italy. The very notion of exile sticks in the Palestinian craw, reinforcing figuratively as it does their own regional exodus while seeming also like an alarming first step toward the forcible relocation of all Palestinians from Greater Israel — a cleansing scenario supported by ultra-right Israelis.
When Israeli troops began clearing up some of the garbage from Manger Square on Tuesday in preparation for what was believed to be an imminent end to the siege, a 15-year-old boy looked on with disgust and remarked to a reporter: "They're collecting garbage because they are garbage."
Among the gunmen inside the church is Ibrahim Abayat, known leader of the Al Aqsa Brigades, the armed wing of Arafat's Fatah movement. But the Palestinian community in Bethlehem is enraged by the prospect of Abayat being exiled. Indeed, many of us are similarly enraged — because exile is far too charitable a resolution. He should be tried for murder, deserving of nothing more than a lifetime in prison.
It feels as if all the word has been held hostage for far too long to the hardening vision of Palestine. So fixated has become this preoccupation that none of the principles that generally apply to criminals — no negotiation, no amnesty, vigorous prosecution — have been promoted by the international community for dealing with the gunmen and militants who've carved terrorist fiefdoms out of the West Bank. 
How galling that the negotiators — nay, supplicants — seeking to end the siege at the Church of the Nativity had concocted a scheme incorporating exile to Italy for the most odious of the gunmen involved, yet never even bothered to consult with the Italian government. This contracicts everything zionism stands for. To the surprise of no one, the Italians wanted no part of this. Goodness, why would they accept 13 Palestinian militants (26 others would have been sent to the Gaza Strip, a further 84 Palestinians released), particularly since it was so unclear what Italy was expected to do with the militants once they got there? 
Late yesterday, it appeared the two sides had reached a deal, which would see the 13 transported first to Cyprus and on from there. Earlier, one suggestion was to have the Palestinians travel on "study visas," kept in Italy for three to five years under supervision and "academic instruction," according to one negotiator. This would have provided Arafat with the public wiggle room to claim the militants had never been exiled, merely gone off to study. What a scam.
Meanwhile, the protesters and activists — having already run the military gauntlet to align themselves with the militants — had been demanding immunity from arrest or deportation, threatening to remain in the church if such assurances weren't received. Now, that's precious. The gunmen get airlifted to cozy exile and their silly activist devotees initiate Siege: The Sequel inside the church.
You couldn't make this stuff up.
Yesterday, Bush reiterated his support for a Palestinian state. That remains the overarching goal and a central non-negotiable principle in the Mideast crisis. But nationhood demands basic principles, too: respect for law (what zionism is about), protection of citizens, a transparent system of justice, domestic security.
As a zionist, I really wish to see peace. When I realized Arafat is not the person I thought he was, it upset me. It means peace is less likely. As a zionist, I do not like seeing any person suffer, be that person Palestinian or Israeli.</b><br>

<b>Lucid, your claim of "pretext" is nonsense re: the Golan. Thousands of Israelis fled for their lives from the sniper. No one in the world came to help Israel. You right, the Israeli army did help. It captured the Golan as a last resort. Lucid, calling it a "pretext" is an insult and lacks humanity. How would you like it if people were firing bullets at your home. Your family had nightmares and ran for dear life. You called on the international community for help, to no avail. Finally, your police go and remove the people firing those bullets at you.  Another party comes and condemns those police saying they greedy and occupiers etc.
Golan is not occupied. It is desperation, as a last resort from an implacable enemy that fired directly on civilians. The claim of "pretext" is absolute, total trash and nonsense. The Israeli government did not teach us that Golan is part of Israel. We ran to the government. We the people of Israel said to the government "Help us, life is unliveable". Only Syria convinced us, not Israel. I am very thankful the Golan was captured. When I still have nightmares from those snipers, it's an insult to call it a pretext. No international force offered to help.  </b><br>

<b>
"This has nothing to do with Islam," British P.M. Tony Blair recently told a delegation of Muslims at a meeting at 10 Downing Street, referring to the Sept. 11 [terrorist] attacks. 
Mr. Blair was echoing a view, popular both in Europe and the U.S., that it is impolite, not to say impolitic, to subject Islam to any criticism. Yet to claim that the attacks had nothing to do with Islam amounts to a whitewash. It is not only disingenuous but also a disservice to Muslims, who need to cast a critical glance at the way their faith is taught, lived and practiced. 
Even worse, the refusal to subject Islam to rational analysis is a recipe for further fanaticism. Unless we believe those who claim that the Sept. 11 was organized by Israel, we have to assume that Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda were responsible. And since there is no mechanism for excommunication in Islam, bin Laden and his gang have every right to describe themselves as Muslims. 
Al Qaeda did not materialize out of thin air. Nor have they been operating in a vacuum. Bin Laden belongs to a prominent Yemeni-Saudi family that makes much of its Islamic credentials. He began his militant career in 1984 as a fund-raiser for Afghans fighting the communist regime in Kabul in the name of Islam. He had offices in a dozen Muslim countries, none of which regarded his activities as un-Islamic. 
In 1993 bin Laden was divested of his Saudi passport but was warmly welcomed in Sudan where a fundamentalist regime is in power. Later, bin Laden was the star of an international conference of Muslim fundamentalists organized in Khartoum by the then-strongman Hassan al-Turabi. He was elected a member of the Supreme Council, whose task is to promote a radical brand of Islam throughout the world. 
That gave him the right to call himself a "sheik" and issue religious fatwas, or edicts. Again, since there is no clerical hierarchy in Islam, there was no reason why bin Laden could not claim such authority. 
Once bin Laden was forced to leave Sudan (under U.S. pressure), he was welcomed in his ancestral homeland of Yemen, another Muslim country. From there he went to Pakistan, the world's second most populous Muslim nation, where he was welcomed not only by the army but also by virtually all of Pakistan's Islamic parties, which continue to support him. 
From Pakistan, bin Laden shifted to Afghanistan, where the Taliban had established what they claimed to be "the only truly Islamic government." The Taliban continue to shelter bin Laden to this day, even in the face of U.S. attacks. 
To say that bin Laden has nothing to do with Islam and Muslims, therefore, requires a big leap of imagination. 
There is more. All but one of the world's remaining military regimes are in Muslim countries. 
With the exception of Turkey and Bangladesh, there are no real elections in any Muslim country. 
Of the current 30 active conflicts in the world no fewer than 28 concern Muslim governments and/or communities. Two-thirds of the world's political prisoners are held in Muslim countries, which also carry out 80% of all executions each year. 
Anyone familiar with textbooks in most Muslim countries would know the twisted view of the world they propagate and the hatred they promote. 
Anyone who follows the media in the Muslim world would know that the verbal version of the Sept. 11 attacks is an almost daily fare. Go to the Internet and check the editorials of virtually any Muslim paper on Sept. 10 and see what they were saying about the West in general and the U.S. in particular. 
Anyone listening to a sermon in virtually any mosque, including many in the West, would be shocked by the vehemence of the anti-Western, especially anti-American, sentiments expressed. 
It is both dishonest and dangerous for Muslims to remain in a state of denial. And yet a state of denial is what we have. 
When Iran's Khomeinists burned 600 people alive in a cinema, the whitewashers said that it had nothing to do with Islam. When the same gang took the American diplomats hostage in Tehran, again the whitewash party insisted that had nothing to do with Islam. And when the suicide bombings bloodied Beirut we were told that Islam had nothing to do with them. 
The Muslim world today is full of bigotry, fanaticism, hypocrisy and plain ignorance -- all of which create a breeding ground for criminals like bin Laden. 
The principal victims of these criminals are Muslims, who are prevented from developing a modern political culture without which they cannot reform their societies and rebuild their economies. 
What I am saying is not meant as critique of Islam as a belief system; that's an issue for theologians. What is needed is a critique of Islam as an existential reality. The Sept. 11 tragedies should trigger a rethink of the way Muslims live Islam. We should start with condemning those attacks without "ifs" and "buts." 
Sadly, the way we Muslims live Islam today is a far cry from the way our ancestors lived it in the golden age when Islam was a builder of civilization, not a force for repression, terror and destruction.

<b>Brief assessment of the Palestinian Authority's (PA) record on compliance with its commitments under the October 23, 1998 Wye River Memorandum
Source:
"Society of dialogue of Zionists and non-Zionists of North America, based in Chicago" 
Press Office, February 2, 1998
1. Fighting Terrorism 
=== Obligation === 
The Wye agreement requires the PA to "take all measures necessary in order to prevent acts of terrorism" and to wage a "comprehensive... continuous and constant" campaign against the "terrorists, the terror support structure, and the environment conducive to the support of terror." The PA must also submit a security work plan detailing the measures they intend to take against terror organizations. 
=== Status of Compliance === 
The PA has refused to wage a comprehensive campaign against terror groups and their infrastructure:
* No steps have been taken to disarm and disband terror groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad. PA Minister and senior Palestinian negotiator Dr. Nabil Shaath recently acknowledged, "There are no provisions for dismembering Hamas or the Islamic resistance or their offices... or any of the things Israel considered the infrastructure of terrorism." (quoted in the Palestinian weekly The Jerusalem Times, December 18, 1998). 
* The PA submitted only a partial security work plan for November lacking in detail, and they failed to submit a work plan for December. 
* Terrorists detained by the Palestinian police are rarely interrogated on matters relating to Israel, and little effort is made to glean information from them. 
* In recent weeks, some 60 terrorists have been released from prison by the PA, including senior members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, as well as terrorists who have been involved in attacks in which Israelis and Americans were killed. Among those released: Ziad Abu al-Ghal, head of the Islamic Jihad's military wing in Gaza; Mehdi Inbatawi, one of Islamic Jihad's leading figures in Judea and Samaria; Abdallah Shami, an Islamic Jihad leader in Gaza who publicly called for the murder of President Clinton prior to the latter's December 1998 visit to the region; Hassam Alimani, a senior Hamas terrorist and arms dealer; and Jihad Suwiti, a senior Hamas terrorist who served as deputy to Hassan Salameh, the mastermind of the February-March 1996 wave of suicide bombings in Israel. 
* The PA has re-instituted its "revolving door" policy of detaining terrorists for brief periods, only to release them quietly shortly thereafter. 
Conclusion: The PA is violating its obligation to combat terror and detain fugitives. 
2. Confiscation of Illegal Weapons 
=== Obligation === 
The Wye agreement obligates the PA to establish a legal framework for the collection of illegal weapons held by civilians and to implement a comprehensive campaign to confiscate such weapons. The PA agreed that the Israeli-Palestinian Joint Security Committee would convene to formulate the modalities for issuing weapons licenses to civilians. Additionally, the PA must collect and dispose of weapons used by its own security forces which are prohibited by the Oslo Accords. 
=== Status of Compliance === 
The PA did issue a decree on the subject of weapons possession, but: 
* There has been no campaign undertaken to confiscate illegal weapons. Tens of thousands of unlicensed arms and munitions are circulating freely in PA-controlled areas, and uncontrolled smuggling and illicit manufacturing have added to the numbers. 
* The PA has refused to discuss the modalities for issuing weapons licenses in the Joint Security Committee with Israel. 
* The Palestinian security forces possess various weapons prohibited by the accords such as mortars, land-mines and grenade launchers, and the PA has refused to dispose of them. 
* The PA also has quantities of weapons exceeding the limits permitted by the agreements. 
Conclusion: PA is violating its obligations regarding the confiscation of illegal weapons. 
3. Reducing the Size of the Palestinian Police 
=== Obligation === 
The Wye agreement requires the PA to reduce the size of its police force to the number permitted under the Oslo Accords and to transfer to Israel a list of recruits. Under Oslo, the PA is permitted to deploy no more than 30,000 policemen in the areas under its control. 
=== Status of Compliance === 
* The PA has refused to transfer the list of its police recruits to Israel, and it continues to employ dozens of Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists as policemen. 
* At least 12 wanted fugitives, including several who have killed American and Israeli citizens, are known to be serving in the Palestinian Police. 
* By its own admission, the PA has some 40,000 policemen on its payroll, which is 10,000 over the limit under the accords. 
Conclusion: PA is violating its obligations regarding the size of the Palestinian police. 
4. Inciting Violence and Organizing Riots 
=== Obligation === 
The Wye agreement requires the PA to "take all measures necessary in order to prevent acts of terrorism, crime and hostilities directed against the Israeli side... and to prevent incitement." 
=== Status of Compliance === 
In November and December 1998, Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO planned and organized mass riots in Judea, Samaria and Gaza to pressure Israel to release Palestinian terrorists from prison. Rioters clashed with Israeli security forces and attacked Israeli civilians. One of these riots evolved into a near-lynching of an Israeli soldier, a passerby in the area. Senior Palestinian leaders have openly called for the use of violence against Israel, as the following examples illustrate: 
* On January 24, 1999, Fatah Central Committee member Saher Habash delivered a speech in the name of Chairman Arafat in which he declared, "The agreements will not liberate the land. Every centimeter requires a struggle, and the land requires blood... We must continue the struggle for which the martyrs fell..." (quoted in the official PA newspaper, Al-Hayat Al-Jadeeda, January 25, 1999) 
* On January 11, 1999, official Palestinian Authority television broadcast a 4-year old girl chanting, "My rights - I shall taken them. I shall take them with a machine gun and a knife. I shall return soon..." 
* On December 1, 1998, Abu Ala, the speaker of the Palestinian parliament, told a rally of Palestinians: "The leadership that threw stones is ready to return and use stones to free the people and the land." (quoted in The New York Times, December 3, 1998) The next day, a Palestinian lynch mob attacked an Israeli vehicle near Ramallah, stoning the car and nearly killing its passengers. 
* On November 15, 1998, Yasser Arafat addressed a rally in Ramallah, where he said, "Our rifles are ready and we are ready to raise them again if anyone tries to prevent us from praying in holy Jerusalem... There are agreements and they better be carried out, because the 'generals of the stones' [i.e. intifada rioters] are ready..." (quoted in the Palestinian daily Al-Ayyam, November 16, 1998)
Conclusion: The PA is violating its obligation to prevent anti-Israel incitement and violence. 
5. General Incitement and Hostile Propaganda 
=== Obligation === 
The Wye agreement obligates the PA to issue a decree prohibiting incitement and to establish a mechanism which would "act systematically against all expressions or threats of violence or terror." 
=== Status of Compliance === 
On November 19, 1998, the PA published a decree against incitement. The decree contains inconsistencies and makes no reference to terrorism, as required by the Wye agreement. The PA has failed to implement the decree. Senior Palestinian officials and the Palestinian media continue to engagein anti-Semitic and anti-Israel incitement, as the following examples illustrate: 
* On December 25, 1998, PA Minister for Refugee Affairs Abdallah Hourani said he expects, and is looking forward to, the demise of the State of Israel. He told the Palestinian weekly The Jerusalem Times: "I don't see Israel surviving much longer and people shouldn't be quick to lose faith regardless of the difficulties, because I can't imagine a country's rise and fall taking only 50 years. People have to be patient... Our day is coming. Crusaders ruled our land for 242 years, and Israel is like a tree planted in improper soil. It will never thrive." 
* A November 7, 1998 article in the official PA newspaper Al-Hayat Al-Jadeeda, said, "Corruption is part of the nature of the Jews... the Jews were subjected to losses and expulsion as a result of their wickedness and their despicable acts." 
* A November 3, 1998 religious program broadcast on official Palestinian Authority television asserted, "the Jews are the seed of Satan and the devils.... The Jews do not believe in God...They have distorted the faith and exchanged the gift of God for heresy, rebellion and prostitution, and distorted the Torah...." 
Conclusion: The PA is violating its obligation to halt incitement and hostile propaganda. 
6. Bilateral Security Cooperation with Israel 
=== Obligation === 
The Wye agreement requires the PA to engage in "full bilateral security cooperation" with Israel that is "continuous, intensive and comprehensive". 
=== Status of Compliance === 
The PA has refused to allow its security services to cooperate fully with Israel. The cooperation that does exist is spotty. The PA has restricted itself to primarily responding to Israeli tips on planned terrorist actions and it refrains from volunteering intelligence, sharing information, taking the initiative against the terror infrastructure and interrogating detainees. 
Conclusion: The PA is violating its obligation to maintain full bilateral security cooperation with Israel.
7. Refraining from Unilateral Measures 
=== Obligation === 
The Wye agreement reaffirms the commitment undertaken in the Oslo accords to refrain from steps that would alter the status of Judea, Samaria and Gaza (such as a declaration of statehood or annexation). Both sides are obligated to negotiate the final disposition of the territories. 
=== Status of Compliance === 
Palestinian leaders have repeatedly stated their intention to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state on May 4, 1999, when the Interim Period ends. Addressing a rally in Nablus on November 14, 1998, Yasser Arafat said, "We will declare our independent state on May 4, 1999 with Jerusalem as its capital, yes Jerusalem, the eternal capital of our state, whether they like it or not. Now we are on our land and we are regaining this holy land inch by inch until we set up our state in 1999." 
Conclusion: The PA is violating the Wye agreement by threatening to adopt unilateral measures. 
8. Amending the Palestinian Charter 
=== Obligation === 
The Wye agreement required the PA to convene the Palestinian National Council (PNC) and other Palestinian bodies to reaffirm the letter sent by Chairman Arafat to President Clinton detailing the changes to the PLO Charter which called for Israel's destruction. 
=== Status of Compliance === 
On December 14, 1998, in the presence of President Clinton, the PNC and other bodies reaffirmed Chairman Arafat's letter by a show of hands. 
Conclusion: The PA fulfilled its Wye agreement obligation regarding the Palestinian Charter. 
9. Reactivating the Interim Committees 
=== Obligation === 
The Wye agreement provided that Israel and the PA would reactivate the standing committees established by the Oslo Accord to address various issues. 
=== Status of Compliance === 
Several of the committees have been meeting on a regular basis, but the PA has refused to convene the Joint Legal Committee and the Standing Cooperation Committee despite repeated Israeli requests. 
Conclusion: The PA is violating its obligation to convene the Interim Committees.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<b>Dear Lucid
Firstly, you say "you zionists" How do you know I am a "zionist"? Have you met me? Do you know what I believe in? Where in my paragraph did I say I am a zionist? You say you would if it's a just cause. What these Muslim extremists are doing (which anyone there can testify) is making children have nightmares everytime they here the word "Palestine". There many people here, who did not know much about the Middle East, except aware that there is a conflict there. After watching Muslim extremists behaving worse than animals at the WCAR(and this is common knowledge) turned against Palestine. Thousands who watched their behaviour said "My goodness, is this what Palestine is about? In that case, tough nuts to Palestine" Thousands upon thousands of people said that.
Well Lucid, if you think teaching thousands of people to hate Palestine is a just cause, you should have joined in with that group. I personally was taught to hate Palestine. No Jewish group ever taught me to. Muslim groups did. As a child, having nightmares hearing the word "Palestine" by continually growing up seeing thousands of people screaming fanatic curses through megaphones like "in the name of Allah, death to...." and fanatic fists waving. I lived with this constantly as a child. No other group taught me to hate Palestine. Lucid, if you think Muslims teaching Jews to hate Palestine is a just cause, good luck to you.
Does this mean you a zionist by your definition of the word? By your definition of the word, does it mean the Muslim demonstraters are zionists, as they taught thousands to hate Palestine. More than any Jewish group in this area.</b><br>

<b>I am a zionist. As a Zionist, I always wanted to negotiate with Arafat, as zionism taught me to always hear the other side. I am still prepared to speak to him, as a zionist,even though I since know of the  report documenting the two faces of Palestinian Authority chairman Yasir Arafat--how he claims
to Western audiences that he wants "peace," while simultaneously urging
Arab audiences to continue their terrorist war against Israel.
        Writing on the op-ed page of the New York Times on Feb. 3, 2002,
Arafat claimed that he opposes violence against Israel.  Yet to Arab
audiences, Arafat continues to urge war.  Addressing  a crowd in Ramallah
on Feb. 7, 2002, Arafat declared, "We will make the lives of the infidels
Hell!" (Videotape of the speech was broadcast on Israel Television.)  In a
speech in Ramallah on Feb. 6, 2002, which was broadcast on Israel
Television, Arafat led the crowd in a chant of "A million martyrs marching
to Jerusalem!" In a speech to Palestinian Arab leaders from Hebron, which
was broadcast on official PA Television on January 26, 2002, Arafat urged:
"Jihad, jihad, jihad, jihad, jihad!"   
        At the same time, Arafat's official PA media continue to praise and
glorify terrorists who murder Jews:
        ...After an Arab terrorist murdered three Israelis in the town of
Hamra on Feb. 6, 2002, the PA's official "Voice of Palestine" Radio praised
the attack as "istish-haad" --an act of "heroic martyrdom."   Anchorman
Nizar Al-Ghul commented: "The man carrying out the operation became a
heroic martyr after killing two ettlers and a soldier and wounding at least
four." (The two "settlers" were an unarmed woman and her 11 year-old
daughter.)  During the morning news program, a song was played that
repeatedly  called for "martyrs" and for acts of "heroic martyrdom" inside
Jerusalem.
        ...When an Arab suicide bomber seriously wounded two Israelis on
Jan. 30, 2002, the PA's official "Voice of Palestine" Radio hailed the
attack as "amaliya istish-hadiyya" --"an operation of heroic martyrdom."
        ...When female suicide bomber Wafa Idris struck in Jerusalem on
Jan.29, 2002, killing one Israeli and wounding over 150 others, the
PA-sponsored newspaper Al Ayam published a front page photograph of the
terrorist with three sympathetic death notices calling her a "heroine" and
a "martyr."  On Jan. 31, 2002, Arafat's Fatah movement held a rally for
elementary school girls in honor of Idris.  A photo in Al Ayam (Feb. 1,
2002) showed the girls carrying posters reading "The Fatah
Movement...proudly eulogizes their heroine Martyr, from the Alamari refugee
camp, the martyr Wafa Idris."

        The ZOA's new report, Arafat Glorifies Murderers, reveals how
Arafat and the PA encourage terrorism against Israel by:
*  Publicly praising terrorists as "heroes," "martyrs," and "righteous
prophets."
*  Naming streets and public squares after prominent terrorists.
*  Publicly bestowing awards, such as the PA's "Jerusalem Decoration," to
terrorists.
*  Giving dead terrorists a hero's burial, accompanied by uniformed PA
policemen and eulogies delivered by PA leaders.
*  Holding memorial rallies for terrorists at PA schools.
*  Paying salaries to imprisoned terrorists.
*  Offering scholarships to the children of terrorists who are killed while
trying to murder Israelis.

<b>While Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat yesterday renewed his English-language bid to be seen as a peacemaker in a New York Times opinion piece, two compelling new video documentaries produced in France using footage from Palestinian television and other sources suggest he is employing a strategy of saying one thing while doing another. 
"Israel and the War of Images" and "The Trojan Horse," both produced in France with English and French dubbing and subtitles show Arafat and his spokesmen, clerics and negotiators revealing that peace negotiations with Israel are part of a strategy leading ultimately and inevitably to the destruction of the Jewish state. 
The video documentaries include clips from 1994 through 1999 of the top Palestinian spokesmen all candidly explaining this strategy to Arabic audiences. All of the comments were made after the signing of the Oslo Accords in which Arafat pledged to renounce violence against Israel and to promote mutual respect between the negotiating parties. 
"All these elements will push us continuously toward our goals," explains Nabil Sha'ath, Arafat's chief negotiator, in 1999. "We still haven't lost hope (of achieving the ultimate objectives.) We are not waiving our rights. Who told you we are waiving our rights? On the contrary, we demand more. We have moved from demanding limited autonomy, and later we said we would not accept less than an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital. Have our expectations decreased. No, they have increased." 
Arafat himself explains the ploy in a 1994 speech in South Africa. 
"I don't consider the agreement any more than the agreement which was signed by our prophet Mohammad and the Qurayish," he said. 
Mohammad signed a peace agreement with the Qurayish Jews who lived in Mecca, until his Islamic warriors were strong enough to conquer them. 
Over and over again, Palestinian leaders explain that their ultimate goals remain a Palestine from "the sea to the river" – meaning from the Jordan to the Mediterranean. 
The documentaries, which are now being distributed in the U.S. exclusively through WorldNetDaily's online store, ShopNetDaily, also show Arafat calling for jihad and total victory over Israel, his spokesmen denying the reality of the Jewish Holocaust, the training of Arab children as young as 4 years old in commando-style warfare and the indoctrination of the young in martyrdom. 
"Jews are Jews," shouts one of Arafat's clerics in a Friday sermon broadcast on Palestinian television. "Amongst those are no moderates, nor peace partisans. They are all liars. They must be massacred; they must be killed. Allah the Almighty said, 'Fight them. That's what the Jews are. Have no pity for them, wherever they are, in whatever country. Fight them wherever you are. Wherever you meet them, kill them." 
The documentaries combine these powerful images and words with confrontations never before seen between reporters questioning Arafat on his deliberate use of children in his uprising or "intifada" against Israel. 
"Can you prove it?" he demands. "Can you prove it?" 
Palestinian children are shown getting summer camp demonstrations in assassination techniques and firearms training. 
The children explain themselves what they are taught – that the Jews are the enemy and must be killed. 
Yesterday the New York Times published an opinion piece by Arafat in which he claims he condemns the recent terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens. He also maintains his goal remains a Palestinian state living side by side with Israel as an equal and peaceful neighbor.

<b>I was one of the Israeli soldiers who were not a "refusenik". I admit, the Israeli Defence Force did on numerous occasions violate human rights on this operation. There was definitely not a "massacre" as fabricated by the Palestinian side. Every survey confirmed that. I am totally against those who violated rights. I am however, not against Israel's invasion of the Wesbank. The collections of explosives/ammunition/bombs I saw with my own eyes, no one on this planet can convince me it is purely from desperation. Half those weapons came from Arab lands, particularly Saudi Arabia. We found enough to literally destroy entire Israel. To have that many bombs is by another source fueling the Palestinian camp. One cannot accumulate all those bombs from desperation. The thought of the Israeli army not going in is what scares me. Other armies would bomb these areas. We lost 23 of our men, to avoid this, to spare Palestinian civilian life. I know I contradicted myself saying there were violations. Certain elements did bad things. The aim of sending tanks, not bombs from above however, was to keep down civilian deaths. No, I'm not a "refusenik" and proud of it. I saw the evidence why with my own eyes.</b><br>

<b>Dear Lucid
Here is a question for you.
What would happen if you were a typical middle class Christian and knew little about Palestine except aware there is a conflict there. You then saw a few thousand people marching down your city. They were flaunting the Palestinian flag and swastikas. Some one was screaming through a megaphone “In the name of Allah and Palestine, may every Zionist be cursed in their graves” in return, you see thousands of fists waving and thousands screaming “death death death”. What would go through your mind? 
What would happen if you were forty years old and you saw this constantly for forty years since being a baby? That is the real reason so many South Africans are turning against Palestine.
I am a South African Jew, my parents were born in East Europe. When I was 5 years old, I would have nightmares where Palestine was a monster trying to chase me. Why? Not from any Jewish organization. I grew up continually watching Islamic extremists screaming curses through a megaphone in the name of Palestine.
When I was a teenager, I realized this paranoia to Palestine is an emotion and actually proves nothing about the Middle East. If I wish to reach peace, I must fight against it. What’s more important, peace or my own emotions?
This became more and more difficult. The fanaticism just continued. I tried negotiating  with the muslim population here. Some were happy to talk. Others refused. My university years were filled with pure hate in the name of Palestine. If I showed you the brochures I read, you would not be able to give an opinion of agree/disagree. Eg “may every Zionist die  in hell. Death to every Israeli supporter. Death Death Death”. 
Ironically, if I as a Jew, wish to understand Palestine, I have to fight against Islam in this country. The extremists here are doing everything to make it difficult for me.  Another time at the university, I approached the Muslim Student Federation about talks about the Middle East so we can understand each other. They refused but responded five days later. How did they respond? About five thousand people marching on the university campus screaming curses through a megaphone such as “Allah Akbar, in the name of Palestine and the Holy Koran, may Allah torture every Zionist to death.” Thousands of people waved their fists. All my years on campus, every single time I ever saw the Palestinian flag, there was some curse under it. The most mild being “death to Zionism”.
Long before even the Durban conference, I watched one of the many horrific rallies. This was the one where all my emotions from childhood that I tried to suppress (for the sake of peace), came back tenfold. Since then, I have nightmares every time I hear the word Palestine. I wish to cry whenever I see the Palestinian flag.
Believe it or not, the Muslim extremists here have not made me turn towards Israel. They have made me lose all interest in the Middle East. I don’t even see myself as being Jewish anymore. I just want nothing to do with the Middle East.
Ironically, in all my years in South Africa, no other group ever taught me to hate Arabs, Moslems or Palestinians. Not the previous government, not the new government. No Jewish group taught me either. (be that group Zionist or not).
The only group that taught me, not to specifically hate Palestine, but to develop a paranoia and hate wanting to help or be involved, is the Islamic extremists here. 
The disgusting, despicable behavior at the Durban conference alone, taught thousands of people to hate Palestine. There is no need to try prove me wrong re: the behavior. This is common knowledge. To south Africans, watching Islamic extremists behaving like this in the name of Palestine is old news already. This was however, the first time it made the news and the world found out about the Islamic extremism here. At the WCAR one even had thousands screaming "Heil Hitler" and worse curses. We had some one screaming fanatic curses and thousands shouting "murder the evil zionist infidels" etc. Of all the other oppressed people in the world, no other demonstration came even a molecule compared to the Palestine one. The starving tortured people of Africa also, did not behave like this. The Palestine delegation were the only ones whose behaviour was despicable and left people feeling sour in the mouth.
Here in South Africa however, it is really difficult to help. There too many extremists who light up my childhood nightmares. 
Lucid, you wish to judge zionists by what they "do" not what they "say". In that case, here is a question for you about non-zionists' behaviour. Can you explain the disgusting, reprehensible, despicable, unacceptable behaviour of the Palestine supporters at the WCAR conference in Durban? Their behaviour was beyond a mere demonstration.</b><br>

<b>This Lucid says we should judge zionists by how they behave, not what they say. I will say the same thing about non-zionists. I lived six months in Gaza. Usually when one lives with people, one gets to know them and feel sorry for them. With Palestinians, it's the opposite. Living there turns one against them. They behaved like animals. They publicly tortured a suspected (not proven) collaborater. In their prayers they taught their children to murder Jews. Their will to murder Jews was in the name of Allah nad the Quran, nothing to do with desperation. When I saw how they behaved, I could not blame Israel for using an iron fist. Lucid's claims of Israel might be true. When I meet these people, I cannot blame Israel.</b><br>

<b>July 13, 2001 -- A videotape that appears to show terrorists
impersonating U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon should send shivers
down the spine of any nation that offers up its troops for U.N.
missions.
The 30-minute tape was made near the site where three Israeli
soldiers were abducted by Hezbollah thugs in October. The taping
took place 18 hours after the abduction, and what it reportedly
shows is downright alarming:
* As U.N. soldiers try to tow vehicles used in the kidnapping to
save as evidence, individuals who "seem to belong to the
Hezbollah" arrive and forcibly swipe the vehicles and their contents
right out of the hands of the soldiers.
* The tape shows "blood stains, U.N. uniforms and forged license
plates on the vehicles," according to the official in charge of the
Lebanon mission, Jean-Marie Guehenno. Guehenno admits that
the footage indicates the kidnappers impersonated peacekeepers.
Incredible!
Only 18 hours after being duped by imposters, the peacekeepers
are again caught with their pants down as they try to secure
evidence.
Makes you wonder: Are these soldiers - or Keystone Cops?
It gets worse.
For months, the United Nations denied the tape existed. Now it
admits it's got it, but won't hand it over unless faces - likely
belonging to Hezbollah terrorists linked to the attack - are
obscured.
Why does the U.N. want to hide the tape and protect terror
suspects? To preserve "neutrality," it claims.
Which is, of course, ridiculous.
What good, after all, are peacemakers if they're going to aid and
abet one side in the conflict (that of the terrorists, no less!) by
withholding evidence of their attacks?
Oh, by the way, Hezbollah has hinted of reprisals if the video is
released.
The terrorists say they'd view all U.N. soldiers as "spies" for Israel
if the tape gets out.
Could it be that the United Nations is running scared? That it won't
release the video because it's afraid that it can't protect itself from
the terrorists?
If so, then what's it doing putting troops in harm's way in the first
place?
Rather than appease thugs, the U.N. ought to be aiding in their
capture and releasing the tape - if for no other reason than to
protect itself. After all, if the thugs get away with this, they'll be
pushing the United Nations around forever - or until it cries "uncle"
and leaves with its tail between its legs.
Meanwhile, U.N. soldiers will become targets, not only of the
Hezbollah, but of Israeli - and even other U.N. - troops who might
mistake them for terrorist imposters.
If America already is thinking twice about participating in such
peacekeeping missions, it may soon need to think three and four
times. And, maybe, pull out altogether, rather than send its own
troops off to poorly run operations.
Then, too, there are the efforts to locate and rescue the abducted
Israelis.
Prime Minister Sharon demands the tape be released, unedited.
Properly, the United States has backed him. Lawmakers, including
New York Sens. Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer, have gone
even further.
"I am outraged that the United Nations would withhold evidence of a
criminal act," said Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-Brooklyn), threatening
to block U.S. funds to the world body. Schumer called the U.N.
behavior "a desecration of its peacekeeping mission." How true.
Meanwhile, the Palestinian whom the United Nations (and
America) treats as a legitimate player in the Mideast, Yasser
Arafat, has been out praising terrorists.
Arafat even called the Tel Aviv disco bomber, who killed 20 Israeli
teens last month, "the model of manhood and sacrifice," German
TV reported.
It's only more proof of the folly of remaining "neutral" when it comes
to terrorists and victims</b><br>

<b>I for one, am sometimes zionist and sometimes non-zionist depending on the issue. I agree with zionism for 50% of what it stands for, but definitely not everything.
I often hear the phrase “The West Bank is occupied Palestinian land.” 
(I hear it from zionists and non-zionists)
Yet, it is, in fact, the greatest lie ever perpetrated on the whole of humanity. 
If you think this is an outlandish statement please read on and decide for yourself.
Palestinians claim that Palestine is their land, and that Jerusalem is their capital, and that Israel is occupying their land. To resist occupation they have the right to send suicide bombers into crowded bus stations, pizza parlors, etc., and kill innocent men, women, and children. And all Arab and Muslin countries support them in their claims and actions against Israel.
Because of this occupation of Palestinian land by Israel, because of this crime committed against their Palestinian brothers, all Arabs hate Israel and want to destroy it.
To anyone who is familiar with the facts, and has an objective eye, all this must be fascinating. Because never before has a complete lie, on such a large scale, been so successful.
First, if Arab animosity toward Israel is based on their love and support for their Palestinian brothers, and in wanting their Palestinian brothers to have their own state, where was that love and support before the Jewish state existed? Where were they when the Kingdom of Jordan ruled Palestine? Why were they not accusing Jordan of occupying Palestinian land? Why did not the Arab world and the United Nations call on Jordan to stop occupying Palestinian land? 
Second, where were the Palestinians themselves, with all their grievances and claims, when Jordan occupied the whole West Bank, including Jerusalem? Did you know that? Did you know that for 19 years Jordan occupied and ruled the whole West Bank, including Jerusalem? Why didn’t they clamor for a Palestinian state then?
All this time, did we hear a word about Palestine being occupied by the Kingdom of Jordan? Did we hear anything about a Palestinian state? Or about Jerusalem being the capital of Palestine? No, we did not.
Why not?
Because their never existed a Palestinian state.
In the entire history of nations, Jerusalem was never the capital of any country other than that of ancient Israel and modern Israel. So how can there be a claim on Jerusalem as the capital of a state that never existed?
Lies and more lies, repeated often enough, are assumed to be facts.
I have heard many scholars, including an Arab journalist, question the very notion of a Palestinian people. What, they ask, makes a people?
Well, there are four elements that define a people: language, religion, culture, and cuisine. For example, the Chinese and Japanese are both Oriental. Still, they are two different peoples, because they each have a different language, a different religion, a different culture, and a different cuisine.
The Palestinians speak the same language, follow the same religion, manifest the same culture, and eat the same cuisine as all the other Arabs. They are really Arabs who happen to live in a region called Palestine.
Palestine is not, and never was, the name of a country, or the name of a people.
It is the name of a region – just like Siberia is a region, not a country. There is no Siberian country, nor is there aSiberian people. It is a region. Just like the Sahara is a region, not a country. There is no Saharan country, nor is there a Saharan people. The Arabs living in that region are Libyans, Moroccans, etc., etc. It is a region. 
Because Palestine is a region, not a country, England was able to carve out half of it and give it to the Arabs living on the other side of the Jordan River and call it the Kingdom of Jordan. Because Palestine is a region the United Nations was able to divide the rest of it between the Jews and the Arabs living there. 
Had the Arabs accepted the United Nations resolution there would have been a newly created Arab state called Palestine. Instead they rejected the United Nations compromise and went to war to destroy Israel. They lost the war. Hence, no Palestinian state.
Here are some cold facts.
King David built the city of Jerusalem, and King Solomon, David’s son, built the holy temple. This commonwealth of Israel lasted for a thousand years. There was only one break, when, 400 years after King David, the Babylonian invaders occupied the land for 70 years. Then, with the help of Cyrus the Great of Persia - yes, Persia - Israel came back to the land, rebuilt the temple, and ruled for another 600 years.
Then the Romans came and ruled the land, then the Crusaders ruled the land, then the Ottoman Empire ruled the land, then the British Empire ruled the land, then Israel returned to its homeland and built a modern Jewish state. 
It was never - repeat, never - a Palestinian state. So what is all this talk about occupied Palestinian land?
They certainly have a right to live there freely and happily. Nobody wants to move them away from their land. But from where comes the right for a Palestinian state? Is it because they live there?
Imagine, if the Mexican-American community in California, whose numbers are greater than the number of Palestinians in the West Bank, decides tomorrow to claim that the United States is occupying their land, because they live there and they want their own Mexican state. Imagine, if when the U.S. government says, “No, you can live here but you cannot have sovereignty, you cannot have your own state,” they start sending suicide bombers, shooters, mortars, etc., etc. into the rest of the country, what do you think would happen?
This is precisely why there was never any suggestion of a Palestinian state; not under the Romans, not under the Crusaders, not under the Turks, not under the English, and not under the Arab Kingdom of Jordan, not until after Israel was again established in its homeland.
I believe it is the big lie of our generation and we are all buying into it.</b><br>

<b>This Lucid character claims that zionists should be judged by what they do, not what they say. Great, I will do the same about non-zionists. I was at the WCAR in Durban. The behaviour of the Palestine supporters was disgusting. There were plenty other groups there. None behaved like the Palestine suppoters. They went in their thousands, with banners like "death to zionism" or "zionism = nazi" or "slaughter every zionist infidel". They went screaming "death death death". No other group there, from the most oppressed in the world, from the worst regimes, behaved in this disgusting way. After witnessing this with my own eyes? STUFF PALESTINE. The irony of this conference, is we had Muslims teaching Jews, Christians and Hindus to hate Palestine. After that disgusting behaviour, I don't want to every hear the word "Palestine" again. </b><br>

<b>Lucid
I agree with you, holding land from biblical claims is illegal. Israel's claim to Golan is defending it's very existance from sniper fire. It has got nothing to do with zionism or anything biblical.
I dislike seeing any person put in jail for not trial or puppet trial. That is why I'm proud to be a zionist. Zionism is not immoral. You the one who twisted the meaning. You have the Chomsky twisted view of Zionism. I want peace. I want suffering to end. I get no pleasure of Palestinian or Israeli suffering. I plan to go there and bring the sides to understand each other. For example, if the Arabs in the Wesbank could have more freedom and higher standard of living, one of the many things I strive for, I will be much happier. That is why I'm proud to be a zionist. To me and 99% of Zionists, zionism means love, caring, helping, rights for all, understanding etc. When I see people come and twist what zionism means, I feel sick.

<b>To Peter &amp; Yaron. 
Peter, I repeat what I said earlier: the concept of occupying land as a "compliance" with biblical claims is illegal. Consequently, Zionism has an immoral basis. Now, you keep highlighting your efforts for peace but as I questioned before without getting an answer, your militancy for peace does not seem it helped so far a just peace. I would therefore conclude that your view of peace is one-sided, that is, peace for Israel and "let others go to hell", basically the view of war criminal Sharon. So, if you have contributed in a way or another to a just peace, I would be curious to know how. To Yaron, I understand the situation you've faced in 67, a situation also faced by many others in times of war and I am sorry for that, but I believe "almighty" Israel or any international force would have protected you if allowed to do so. I think what you faced was another good pretext by Israel to grasp more land, using that same pretext to remain since there. As a proof, it has been now more than 35 years since it happened, so if Israel was really willing to deal security against the return of the land as you said, first it would have had enough time to come up with a proposal, which it never did and second, it would not have built settlements there. The thing is if you build settlements, you intend to stay. Listen guys, when we really want peace, we strive for peace..Israel does not want peace, Israel wants to keep occupying land...I can only remind you that war criminal Sharon has never approved any peace deal, including those made with Egypt and Jordan...that's the face of Zionism the world see, not your kind words that only feed the numb minds. I am proud of those Europeans who have lately spent time as human shields against agression throughout the occupied territories and came back to us European population with unbiased horror counts of the IDF behavior under the orders of Sharon. Anyway, how could someone trust this criminal who had been already convicted by his own country's court for crimes against humanity, facing the same accusations again now in Brussels, and still here to "finish the job"...he's the shame of your Zionist cause as were many before him throughout the history of Israel....so what did you do for a just peace and what did you do to get rid of your war criminal...?..I am graciously listening...!!!..Btw, if you're still thinking of something to do about him, you may wish to sign this petition which has already been signed by 800K+ people around the world: www.petitiononline.com/warcrime/petition.html...another petition to release palestinian kids from Israeli prisons where they receive a harsh treatment, could also be signed at:  www.petitiononline.com/dcips/petition.html.

<b>It has become unequivocally clear from the questioning of senior Fatah figures  (Marwan Barghouti, Nasser Aweis, Nasser Abu Hamid and Ahmed Barghouti) that Yasser Arafat personally approved funding for Fatah operatives, with the knowledge that it would be used to finance terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians. In addition, it was revealed that explosive charges used by the terrorists were supplied from the Palestinian Authority's own weapons depots. 
During the course Operation Defensive Shield, numerous high-ranking West Bank operatives of Arafat's own Fatah organization were apprehended. Their questioning has revealed a clear picture of the direct link between PA Chairman Yasser Arafat and the terrorist attacks carried out by Fatah members. It has become apparent that Marwan Barghouti, who maintained direct communications with Arafat, transferred money to Fatah operatives, who then used the money to carry out terrorist attacks targeting Israeli civilians. In these operations, numerous civilians were killed. These disclosures render absurd the public and international debate over whether Arafat is 'doing everything possible to prevent terrorism'. These revelations plainly demonstrate that Arafat did indeed do 'everything possible' - but in the realm of 'terrorism promotion' rather than 'terrorism prevention', especially within his own Fatah organization. 
1. Marwan Barghouti, the head of the Fatah in the West Bank, stated when questioned that he was personally involved in directing terrorist attacks which resulted in the killing and injuring of scores of Israeli civilians. Barghouti described in detail the transfer of funds to the terrorist operatives. As the Secretary-General of the Fatah, Barghouti was responsible for providing the funding for weapons acquisition and armed operations. Every operative requiring financing was made to fill out a detailed requisition request. Barghouti then added his recommendation and signature, and relayed the requests to PA Chairman Yasser Arafat. Barghouti stressed that every expense - even the smallest sum - required the approval of Arafat himself. After receiving Arafat's approval, the funding was transferred to the operatives according to the instructions of Hakem Bil'awi, the Secretary of the Fatah Central Committee, who was responsible for disbursements. 
In addition to Barghouti, other senior Fatah figures, who were subordinate to Barghouti, provided details about Arafat's role in the execution of terrorist attacks. 
2. Nasser Aweis, the head of the Fatah infrastructure in Samaria, was responsible for the recruiting, arming and handling of terrorist cells. He stated in questioning that he personally, together with other Tanzim terrorist operatives under his command, received funding directly approved by Yasser Arafat. He explained that the names of the Tanzim terrorist operatives were sent to Marwan Barghouti, who would then present their requests for funding to Arafat for his signature. The operatives would subsequently receive checks corresponding to the approved sum. 
Nasser Aweis admitted to having been behind numerous terrorist bombings and shootings in Israel, among them: 
17 January 2002 - A bombing attack at a banquet hall in Hadera, in which 6 Israelis were killed and 26 wounded. 22 January 2002 - A shooting attack in downtown Jerusalem, in which two Israelis were killed and 36 wounded. 25 February 2002 - A shooting attack in Neve Yaakov, Jerusalem, in which an Israeli policewoman was killed, and 10 civilians wounded. 5 March 2002 - A shooting attack on the 'Seafood Market' restaurant in Tel Aviv, in which three Israelis were killed. 9 March 2002 - A gun and grenade attack in the Margoa Hotel in Netanya, in which two Israelis were killed and 50 wounded. 3. Nasser Abu Hamid, one of the commanders and founders of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, was responsible for numerous shooting attacks, explosive charges and suicide bombings. He revealed during questioning that he and his men received funding and weapons from Marwan Barghouti, through Marwan's aide, Ahmed Barghouti. Abu Hamid stated that Marwan Barghouti was informed of the details of every operation carried out by himself and his men. Marwan Barghouti was also involved in the decision regarding the procurement of weapons for the terrorist cells, and even provided the payment approval for these weapons. 
Abu Hamid and his men were responsible for the following terrorist attacks: 
24 November 2000 - A shooting attack near Akrabeh, in which an Israeli civilian was killed. 21 December 2000 - A shooting attack on Route 443, in which an Israeli civilian was killed 31 December 2000 - A shooting attack near Ofrah, in which the Kahane couple was killed and their five children wounded. 19 May 2001 - The planting of an explosive device in the Biancini Pub in Jerusalem 27 January 2002 - The suicide attack on Jaffa Road in Jerusalem, in which one Israeli was killed and dozens wounded. 27 February 2002 - The murder of the owner of the Bashkevitz factory in Atarot, Jerusalem, and the premature detonation of suicide bomb near the Maccabim roadblock in which the female terrorist was killed. During questioning, Abu Hamid also revealed the involvement of Force 17, Arafat's Presidential Guard, in the execution of terrorist attacks. Abu Hamid stated that his men would receive the explosive devices needed for their terrorist operations from the Force 17 weapons depots. Similarly, terrorist operatives subordinate to Abu Hamid also described Force 17's complicity in attacks. They stated that Force 17 members would regularly assemble explosive devices, which they then provided to Fatah operatives to use in their terrorist operations. 
4. Ahmed Barghouti, the personal aide to Marwan Barghouti, personally dispatched suicide bombers to their terrorist missions, in which dozens of Israeli civilians were killed and hundreds wounded. When questioned he provided details about the numerous attacks in which he was involved, including: 
25 January 2001 - A shooting attack against an Israeli van near the Atarot industrial park in Jerusalem, in which one Israeli was killed. 25 February 2001 - A shooting attack against an Israeli vehicle, west of Bir Zeit, in which an Israeli was critically wounded in the head. 25 August 2001 - A drive-by shooting near the Bet Horon service station, in which three Israelis were killed and two infants wounded. 3 October 2001 - A drive-by shooting on Route 9 in Jerusalem, in which two Israelis were wounded 15 January 2002 - A shooting attack against an Israeli vehicle near the Givat Zeev service station, north of Jerusalem, in which the driver was killed and her companion wounded. The picture that emerges from the questioning of those apprehended during Operation Defensive Shield reveals the direct involvement of Yasser Arafat in the terrorism carried out by his Fatah organization. Noteworthy is the fact that the particulars of this terrorist connection, described by the senior Fatah/Tanzim figures themselves, were supported and corroborated by the numerous documents captured in the offices of the various Palestinian Authority security organs in the course of the operation. </b><br>

I go to Palestinians to tell me their side and what they lived through. They refuse and walk away. 
When I goto them to tell me their side and they walk away and then you come and tell me that I don't care about them, that is when I get angry. I am not a racist. You the one who is only upset about one side, not me. It is me the zionist who cares about both sides vere much.

<b>I cannot agree with Lucide over the Golan Heights.
I was 27 years old in 1967. There was awful firing from the top of the Golan. We had to run for our lives. Many went into shelters. No governement body taught us that Golan is part of Israel or the "Zionist dream". It is the other way round, we told the government we cannot take it. When the shelling would not end, Israel captured the Golan Heights as a last resort. Those bullets and running for my life is what taught me, not any government body. Thank God a million times over Israel captured the Golan. Many Syrians are taught "What claim does Israel have to Golan? Where is it in Jewish history?" Well they correct, Israel does not claim it according to Jewish history. Israel never did. The Golan was captured as a last resort to end the terror on the Galilee. It is well recorded that Syria gave the 3 no's "no peace, no recognition and no negotiation". How would Lucid feel if people were firing live ammunition on his home and when the police removed the source, others labelled the police "occupiers". It is Syria that taught me to take the Golan, not the Israeli government. I have no question in my mind, if I can be guaranteed safety, by all means, I would give it back tomorrow. From an ideological or Zionist perspective, the Golan means nothing to me. It only means I had to run for my life. If Lucid is lucid enough to worry about humanity as he claims, can't he spare a thought for the thousands of Israelis who had to run for their lives from the sniper fire from Syria? I am not fabricating this, I still have nightmares from it.
No one can tell me it's untrue. If after what I had to live through, with continuous bullets flying at civilians, be told it's untrue and "zionist fabrication", then lucid carries no respectability. 
To repeat what was said below, I will bet if Lucid took the trouble to contact those who did not wish to serve in the Wesbank, I will bet that everyone of them sees themselves as Zionists.
If Lucid supports them, it means that Lucid is a Zionist.
Yes I am a zionist. Like Lucid said, Zionists should "do" rather than "talk". That is why, despite running for my life in 67, I have done plenty to help. I encourage dialogue, I have sent groups to Hebron to speak to Arabs who live there to find out what their lives are like etc. That is why I'm a proud Zionist. I don't need a pipsqueak like Lucid who invented his own version of Golan to lecture me on zionism.</b><br>

<b>Hi Peter, I will try to answer your questions. If in the world, at each time a sniper shoots at his neighbors (with very low casualties in our case), a whole country has the right to invade territories of the neighboring country, look at the world map, and you may find 100s of such situations, with higher casulaties, which did not involve grasping land. In fact, agression was so obvious that the IDF needed to kill around 30 navymen on board of a US navy ship to get the job done without any hurdles...!!!..and I beg you pardon, it doesn't look that Sharon has ever offered to return the Golan to Syria. On the subject of suicide bombers, I would use the response of a famous French Jewish lawyer, Maitre Gisèle Halimi, who replied to the same question saying quote: "give Palestinians weapons and check then if suicide bombing continues."..I think the answer is more than self-explanatory. Swiss do not condemn Arabs because they condemn agression, and it's Israel which occupies land, builds settlements, restricts free circulation, restricts water access, destroys buildings financed by Europeans' taxpayers, and acts with Palestinians in a highly racist and inhumane manner...So, what do the Arabs have to be condemned for..?..supporting the just cause of their fellow Arab palestinians...?..Besides, because it's occupation, handing over land should not be considered as a way of reciprocity; it's just compliance with international law..and speaking of land, did you check the link I provided earlier to see what Israel had proposed to Palestinians, a proposal viewed by Israel as being more than "fair"...you're kidding me...!!!!. No need Peter to tell you again that desperation pushes people to kill themselves and that this desperation is the result of years of occupation and frustration.. I may be sentimental but don't fool me with mere details while you keep ignoring the big picture of occupation...add to it that one may even treat you as a racist when you stress lost lives of Israelis while the number is 10x bigger on the other side...Peter, entire families have been rooted from their land and entire families have been killed and you only tell me about the few who died on the other side...the only thing I am proud of Peter, is that I still pertain to a community of humans who have their sights pretty intact to observe the hypocrisy of the world.

<b>Peter, full points for perseverence. I don't even bother debating the anti-zionist fabrications.
Samuel, I prefer your view, I also gave up. All I know, is whenever I say something in public or on internet that people don't aprove, they label me a "zionist". They don't even know who I am. They don't know who taught me. They automatically call me a "zionist" as they don't like what I say. With that reasoning, I am sure they can prove how bad zionism is. If every time some one says something I don't like, I call them an "elephant", I can make elephants look bad.
I am proud to be a zionist.
It is the non-zionists that fabricate. I am sick and tired of listening to the non-zionist fabrications and anti-zionist propaganda. I agree, zionist don't split hairs in their reasoning. Let zionism be forever. I am proud to be a zionist. The fact that virtually every zionist promotes peace, is a fact not an opinion. It was Peter who said goto ANY zionist conventions or stop ANY zionist on the street. Not one conventiently chosen by us. It is the non-zionist who says read THAT book. I am sure I can also scrape out other individuals who pervert a peaceful movement. It is time the zionists stopped being pacifists.

<b>Hi Lucide
Firstly as a zionist, it upsets me to know there is suffering anywhere.
Why do I support the Golan? Israel took it in self defence. If you ask any of the thousands who live in the Galilee. They do not support the Golan because some one taught them to. they do it from nightmares from running away from Syria sniper. Israel tried everything. Israel asked UN, USA for help. Capturing the Golan was a last resort. I do not consider a last resort to protect your citizens, occupation. Especially when you willing to give it back provided you guaranteed of peace.
Secondly, I don't believe the suicide bombers are from desperation. I have seen lots of suffering people throughout the world, ten times worse. (I hate suffering of any group, that is why I am a zionist) Find me another group who produce suicide bombers.
AS for Jerusalem, every single ruler in history, bashed down Jewish temples and denied Jewish entry. This included even modern history. Did Jordan allow Jews to pray there? NO. The condemnations in your area, do they also condemn Arab countries? Arab countries do no justify Israel. However, if they only choose to condemn one and not the other, they cannot be sincere. It also happens that each time Israel hands over territory to the Palestinian authority, they use it for Hizbollah to launch attacks onto Israel. p.s. I have caught on video and many movies (WITH PLEASURE I WILL SUPPLY YOU WITH THE NAMES OF THE MOVIES IF IT INTERESTS YOU) Arafat praising suicide bombers, calling them heroes. These were independently made movies. In public he condemns them. As for the Wesbank? It is well known that Israel begged Jordan to not join in the war in 67, to no avail.
Also, the amount of cross-border incidents on Israel and attacks on Israel and Ketooshas, bombs etc (even long before 67) are endless, there isn't a single person there who hasn't lost a brother/sister/parent/child so you cannot put the same rules like on Switzerland that hasn't suffered.  Every independent source say the PA is doing nothing to help it's people, nothing to do with Israel. I am nevertheless glad I am debating you and welcome your opinions. I am a Zionist and zionism says I should always go out of my way to hear others. The more different sources I listen to the better. If I only listened to one source, it would contradict everything that zionism stands for, that is why I'm proud to be a zionist. The fact that when I goto Arabs here and ask them to explain why they against zionism, and they refuse to and walk away, substantiates my point.

<b>Hi Peter,
I accused Israel of "forgery" because it's Israel that is providing so-called written facts..Palestinians are not putting forward documents to show something, but horrifying pictures and the evolving settlement activity we have been seeing for decades speak for themselves. Everyone knows that occupation and all its consequences are leading hopeless and helpless Palestinians to blow themselves up before those who are occupying their lands, and it's not the words of war criminal Sharon, who just repeated yesterday that Jerusalem is the unified capital of Israel, that will ease the suffering of people in the region. Another example of mean ways used by Israel in its propaganda is the case of the 6 palestinians wanted by Israel as a condition to remove the blocus on Arafat, while everyone knows that those guys were escorted few days back by the IDF from the place of their arrest to Ramallah's court, before suddenly becoming wanted people for another juridiction trial...for a pretext, you cannot find better than that..!!!..As for the Golan heights, I am amazed that you find "normal" to occupy and return a land whenever it pleases the interests of a side, while it would be unbelievable happening elsewhere..!.Israel is indeed above any law. Speaking of Geneva, if you keep counting all these going unheard resolutions and condemnations of Israel by the international community and human rights groups here in Geneva, you may re-think your support for this renegade state....yep, that's beautiful Geneva with its UN Organizations and the Lake of Léman....It's btw the long standing neutral face of Switzerland that makes Swiss look at events with a clear mind, despite all the efforts put forward by Israel to hide the truth...and yes, CH-states are called Cantons.</b><br>

Geneva, Switzerland - Tuesday, May 07, 2002 at 10:29:37 (IDT)<hr>
<b>Within the Palestinian Authority (PA) there is an office entitled General Control (GCO). In May it issued a report that included a startling claim: because of corruption $326 million, roughly one fourth of the PA’s budget, disappeared in 1996. The Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC), which is elected by the people, commissioned nine of its members to check these findings. On July 29 they presented their report. (PLC Report on the Findings of the General Control Office, August 9, 1997. Citations are from the English version, translated by the Jerusalem Media &amp; Communication Center.) In a stormy Council session, which Arafat did not bother to attend, the legislators called on the president to dissolve his government by September, form a new one based on experts, and bring those suspected of corruption to trial. Some of the gravest suspicions concern two of Arafat’s senior ministers, Nabil Sha’at and Jamil Tarifi. I asked Dr. Kamal Sharafi, who headed the committee of nine, why the Council found it necessary to check the report of the PA’s comptroller. Sharafi: "The GCO report was an important contribution toward correct administrative procedures, but it had flaws. There were simple arithmetical errors. In many cases the GCO inspectors had written detailed accounts which did not make it into the final version. Many violations were ignored or left hanging. The main problem, though - which we have tried to correct - was the lack of conclusions. The GCO report failed to accuse persons by name, whether directors or ministers. You might have thought it was the Palestinian people that had stolen the money! The GCO did not ask the Attorney General to formulate indictments. The result was a series of wishy-washy, toothless recommendations, calling weakly for reform and delivering a few hazy warnings, whereas what was needed was a cry for legal action." 
The PLC Committee’s "report on the report" notes further flaws. (1) The GCO failed to check important companies and public institutions that receive funding from the PA. These include the Petroleum General Commission, the al-Baher Company, the Tobacco Company, and the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation. (challenge has reported on the corruption in several of these; see Issues 39 and 43.) (2) The GCO confined itself almost exclusively to Gaza. Its report covered less than a tenth of the ministries, institutions, municipalities, and non-governmental organizations receiving benefits from the PA. (3) It stayed clear of the many security forces, although the Council turned up evidence that they are full of illegal practices, meddling where they have no business. The GCO also kept away from President Arafat’s office. (PLC Report, pages 3,4, and 30.) 
The PLC Committee’s mandate restricted it to checking the GCO report. It could not undertake an independent investigation into areas which the latter had not touched. Despite this limitation, and despite lack of cooperation on the part of the PA comptroller as well as several ministries, the findings are chilling. The overall picture is one of a mafia-style government, where the main point of being in public office is to get rich quick. The Palestinian citizen, after thirty years of neglect under Israel, has fallen into the hands of a ruling class whose motto appears to be, "Eat, drink and be merry." The PA budget and the funds from the donor nations flow around and around within the closed circle of the few, who live a life of luxury while the people they are supposed to serve go hungry. In matters of health care and basic commodities, says the PLC Committee, the little person is a victim of dubious deals between the Palestinian and Israeli ruling elites. This conclusion may seem sweeping, but it arises from every page of the Committee’s report. Except for the Ministry of Education and that of Statistics, even the few untainted offices are described as inefficient and unprofessional. The report notes excessive duplication of tasks and overlapping of responsibilities, especially between the West Bank and Gaza. The PLC Committee cites many kinds of corruption. There are ministers who violated their responsibilities to the point of endangering lives. There are unsupervised bank accounts containing what are supposed to be public funds. There are cronyism and nepotism, monopolies, releases from customs. Wherever greed can get its foot in, the space appears to have been filled. In this article we shall concentrate on three ministries where corruption is especially rife. We shall then briefly survey most of the others. 
1. The Ministry of Health (Minister: Riad al-Z’anoun) Bad or expired drugs were used to treat cancer patients in ministry medical centers. With regard to other medicines as well, the Gaza branch of the ministry used drugs which the West Bank branch had rejected because they failed to meet specifications and had not been registered. Suspicion: Health ministry officials were (and are) in cahoots with a company called Al-Shifa, which imports medicines into Gaza. The report names Dr. Ziad Sha’th, general director of the ministry’s pharmaceutical division, who allowed Al-Shifa to bring in the unregistered drugs on the pretext that registration was underway. On another get-rich note, Al-Shifa imported several drugs as donations from Egypt: exempt, therefore, from customs and value-added tax (VAT). It then turned around and sold them to the Health Ministry including customs and VAT. Suspicion: Al-Shifa was aided in this exercise by one Khamis Najjar, a director of the ministry in Gaza, and by the Minister of Civil Affairs, Jamil Tarifi, a name we shall soon encounter again. The Committee recommended that Arafat direct the PA Attorney General to prosecute the three men named above. In addition, a fifth of the Health Ministry’s budget went to medical expenses abroad. ("Abroad" includes Israeli hospitals.) The Council found this figure rather high. In some cases it was Arafat who ordered the transfer of patients abroad; he had the Finance Ministry deduct the money from the Health Ministry’s budget without notifying the latter. There is also the case, still pending, of Dr. Ibrahim Abu Hmeid, who was appointed to coordinate the distribution of patients among hospitals in Jordan. Several Jordanian hospitals have accused him of receiving bribes and embezzling funds. The Committee asserts that he had accomplices. Its report also raises the inevitable question: Where in all this was the Minister of Health? (PLC Report, pp. 7-8.) 
2. The Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (Minister: Nabil Sha’at) Nabil Sha’at is known to millions as one of the chief Palestinian negotiators. The council found many offenses. For example, any ministry is supposed to open a separate account with the Ministry of Finance for each of its projects. Thus Finance holds the money given by funders for the project, and it can supervise expenditures. Sha’at’s ministry, however, opened separate accounts. Thus ministry officials could conspire with officials of a donor country, open an account together, and manipulate the funds without the knowledge of Finance. This practice has also opened the door for ministry officials to appoint themselves to jobs in the ministry’s projects, giving themselves fat second salaries. The private account gives rise to another perk as well: You hire someone to a project for a large salary, but by prior agreement you pay the person less. The difference goes into what is called a "black box." Sha’at and his director-general control the black box. They hid it from the GCO, but the Council Committee found it. Other ills in the Ministry of Planning: 
Tenders were granted under suspicious circumstances to companies with family connections to people in the ministry. 
Within the ministry’s projects, there was often no regard for budgets; purchase prices were high; there was a lack of competition and a lack of transparency.
The ministry used project funds to cash personal checks for the Minister. These practices have damaged the PA’s credibility with the donor nations. The Committee has called for an investigation of Nabil Sha’ath together with three of his deputies. (PLC Report, pp. 15-16.) 
3. The Ministry of Civil Affairs (Minister: Jamil Tarifi)
The Committee devotes four closely-written pages to this ministry, to which the GCO had given only scant attention. The largest area of offense concerns the granting of exemptions on import duties, especially in the matter of automobiles. This can be a lot of money: the duty can amount to half the price of the (pre-duty) car. The right to grant customs exemptions is vested in the Finance Ministry, not in Civil Affairs. The latter was able to get a foot in, however, in the following manner: All imported goods must enter through Israel. Israel collects the customs on goods which are destined for the Palestinian areas and then transfers this money to the PA. Someone from the PA had to be present at the Israeli gateways, therefore, to tell the Israelis which goods to exempt. Logically, this should have been someone from Finance, but in fact it was Civil Affairs Minister Jamil Tarifi who got the task, perhaps because of his many Israeli connections, which date from before the Intifada. Infringing on the prerogatives of Finance, Tarifi personally exempted cars, furniture, and other goods, including the medicines mentioned above. The paperwork was slipshod or nonexistent. Many cars, after receiving Tarifi exemptions in the name of this or that governmental body, were converted to private ownership. This was the case, for example, with a certain Mercedes, which wound up belonging to none other than... the Coordinator of Customs Exemptions in the Ministry of Civil Affairs. 
At Oslo Israel permitted a few thousand PLO members to return. The PA granted them exemptions from customs. This opened the door to abuse: many a car was exempted on the fictitious claim that it belonged to a returnee. Such a one is Ibrahim Awad Abdel Qader Salameh, 75 years old, supposedly the proud owner of a brand new Jaguar. He does not get to use it much. The family members of Minister Tarifi are always taking it out for a spin. A country without industry or natural resources depends heavily on customs duties. The loss of money through false exemptions amounts to a serious blow. Tarifi’s list goes on. Israel issues work permits, and the PA’s ministries of Labor and Interior are supposed to distribute them. But here too Civil Affairs got a foot in -- again, it seems, thanks to Tarifi’s connections with Israel; his ministry gets work permits and hands them out without telling anyone. Unknown to the Ministry of Finance, Tarifi illegally imposed fees on trucks bringing goods to and from Jordan. At one point, says the Committee, he got the Israelis to close the Jordanian border for two weeks to all trucks bringing cement except those of a company called al-Karmel, which belongs to his eldest son. The Committee sums up Tarifi’s offenses by calling them "a blatant attack on public funds." It asks that the Attorney General bring the Minister to justice. (PLC Report, pp. 17-21.) 
4. Exam
Agriculture (Minister: Abdel Jawad Saleh): The Committee found evidence of many violations, but it did not go into detail. (Ibid.,p.9.)
Public Works (Minister: Azzam al-Ahmad): Most purchases were made by direct order, always from the same importers, rather than by tender. Mr. al-Ahmad states that the violations took place before there was a minister for Public Works. (Ibid.)
Social Affairs (Minister: Intisar Wazzir): This office failed to use proper procedures in the handling of large donations and in distributions to the needy. (Ibid., pp. 9-10.) 
Post and Communication: Among various offenses, this stands out: Many telephones which are supposed to be in government offices have found their way to the private homes of officials and employees. The PA pays their phone bills. (Ibid., p. 10.)
Housing (Minister: Abdel Rahman Hamad): The earlier GCO report noted serious administrative, legal, and financial violations, most of which occurred during the term of the former minister, Dr. Zakarieh al-Agha. The violations include (1) a housing project which was carried out in defiance of regulations, using materials that did not match specifications; (2) questionable allotments of land; and (3) the plunder of sand, one of Gaza’s few and nonrenewable resources. The Committee made inquiries, but the ministry failed to cooperate in response. (Ibid., p. 12.)
Interior. The GCO report exposed the manipulation of state funds. The ministry gave the Council Committee a "positive and reliable response." (Ibid., p. 13.)
Culture (Minister: Yasser Abed Rabo): The minister charged the public $7,671 to install a central heating system in the house he is renting. Almost 90% of the ministry employees are in administrative positions, although many lack educational qualifications. (Ibid., p. 14.)
Information (same minister). Large sums are budgeted for purposes not connected to the ministry’s work, including a $10,000 personal allowance for the minister. (Ibid.)
Supplies (also called Rations) (Minister: Ali Shaheen): This winter people in Nablus got sick because they ate flour whose date had expired. A PLC member, Khussam Khader, exposed the case, showing that old flour had been repackaged. The Council laid the responsibility on the Ministry of Supplies and passed a law redefining its role. Yet the ministry continues to interfere in the sale of flour. It worked in cahoots with a Finance Ministry official, Muhammad Jaradah, using public money to import flour through a company which Mr. Jaradah heads. The Supplies Ministry also blocked the border to other companies, so that Mr. Jaradah’s would have the monopoly. (Ibid., p. 21.)
Transport (Minister: Ali Qawasmeh): Because of slipshod office procedures the PA has lost control over the use of government cars, though it pays all the costs. The Transport Ministry illegally converted some government cars to private ownership without notifying Finance, which is supposed to oversee public property. (Ibid., pp. 22-23.) 
Youth and Sport: Ministry officials used donated money, intended for renovating playgrounds, to cover private expenses. (Ibid., p. 23.) 
Local Governance (Minister: Sa’eb Erakat) This ministry supervises municipalities and village councils. The GCO report covered only thirty of the latter, but it exposed administrative, financial and legal violations. The Committee demanded a response to the GCO findings, but the ministry has refused to cooperate. (Ibid., pp. 25-26.)
Monetary Authority. The committee found excessive and unjustified expenses, as well as discrepancies between financial files and daily books. (Ibid., p. 26.)
TV and Radio Broadcasting Agency. Purchases and tenders are not subject to supervision. As in the case of all ministries and agencies, income is supposed to be transferred to the Finance Ministry for supervision and control, but this is not done. (Ibid., p. 27.)
All nations suffer from corruption, but who would have expected so much so soon? One reason, the Committee report makes clear, is the chaos that prevails in rules and regulations, in defining spheres of authority, and in norms of financial management. (Ibid., p. 28.) All beginnings are difficult, and this is no exception. But other beginnings have a grace which this one lacks. Such widespread corruption could not take hold if the leaders had any national feeling, or sense of community, or higher purpose. These things were surrendered at Oslo. The PA is the creature of Oslo, where a national hope was betrayed for the sake of personal power. That was the arch-corruption. The present examples are its offspring.
Amid the gloom there remains a spark of light: the fact that the PLC Committee report could appear at all. Once again the legislative council has proved, despite its limitations, that there are those who seek to establish a new Palestinian society on foundations of sound administration and public rectitude. We spoke, for example, with Ali Girbawi, a professor in Political Science at Bir Zeit University and head of the Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens’ Rights. In response to the Committee report, he said, "I think that the Palestinian Legislative Council has found its own strength. I don’t think they were aware that they could do what they have done. Now they have realized that they have an impact. If they will hold the executive to account, the people will support them." 
The Committee report exposed the alienation, even hostility, between the PA’s executive and legislative branches. The entire Council approved the report, including PLO supporters close to Arafat, whereas most cabinet ministers took it as a declaration of war. Soon after its publication, sixteen ministers gave letters to Arafat signaling their readiness to resign if he wished. (The sixteen did not include Nabil Sha’ath, Jamil Tarifi, and Yassir Abed Rabu.) Public opinion in the West Bank saw this collective performance merely as a ploy aimed at taking the sting from the report. Kamal Sharafi, head of the Committee, told Challenge: "We didn’t ask anyone to resign. We only demanded that Arafat disperse the cabinet, bring in the Attorney General, and put the guilty on trial. As far as we’re concerned, any ministers who are cleared can become part of the new cabinet." In the meantime an additional factor has emerged. Even as the PLC Committee was conducting its investigation, Arafat appointed Taib Abed al-Rahim, General Secretary of the Presidential Office, to make a detailed inquiry into acts of corruption. The result has been yet another report, 200 pages long, which Arafat is keeping to himself. There are, then, three studies of corruption: that of the GCO, that of the PLC, and now this. The bevy of reports may reduce the overall impact. If Arafat refuses to deal with that of the PLC and ignores its recommendations, the Council will be exposed in all its impotence. Kamal Sharafi, however, counsels against despair. "Let’s wait till September," he says. Meanwhile, corruption is thriving.

<b>
It is not America's moral responsibility to create or foster "free
societies" in the Muslim world. This is the responsibility of Muslims
themselves. A whiny, self-pitying, narcissistic Muslim victimology characterizes
most of the dialogue emanating from the Muslim world today. This is what I
usually hear when I listen to Muslims discuss the problems within their
societies as well as with the West.
Muslims are always the victims, never the perpetrators. They bear no
responsibility for their predicaments. The world is a morality play, in
which Muslims have been cast as the victims, and the West, particularly
the U.S. and Israel, as the villains. This victimology mentality, not U.S.
foreign policy or Israel, is the root cause of the backward, oppressive condition the Muslim world finds itself in
today.
Since September 11th, countless people have argued that American foreign
policy mistakes caused the terrorism and hatred toward America emanating
from the Middle East. This is simply a cop-out. It is hogwash. American
foreign policy has had many flaws around the world. Yet other parts of the
world, particularly Southeast Asia and Latin America, have suffered far more
from U.S. foreign policy than has the Middle East! Even during the Vietnam
War, however, it was rare to find a Vietnamese who hated America itself, as
it is clear many Muslims do today. If U.S. foreign policy toward Muslims
caused the terrorism of September 11th, why didn't U.S. misdeeds in Vietnam,
Cambodia, Nicaragua, etc., cause any terrorism?
Over and over again, Muslims put U.S. support of Israel at the top of their
grievances. There is much to criticize in Israel's treatment of the
Palestinians -- particularly the greedy, provocative building of Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories. Yet there is much to criticize the
Palestinians and their Arab neighbors for as well.  Many Palestinians were
expelled from their homes in 1947-8 (although many others chose to leave).
Yet why couldn't their Arab neighbors take them in -- just as Israel took in
Jews forcibly expelled from Arab countries?
The Arab states cynically chose to have the Palestinians be perpetual
"refugees" as a pawn to use against Israel. People are often expelled or
displaced from their homelands during war, and politically sympathetic
countries take them in all the time -- witness the immigration of many South
Vietnamese to America after the fall of South Vietnam.
The Palestinians now have a national identity of their own. Yet what are
they doing to gain their independence? Instead of skillfully using diplomacy
as well as nonviolent resistance, like Gandhi did in India, they commit
themselves to a hopeless struggle against Israel. They send their children
out to blow themselves up in pointless suicide bombings that have set back,
rather than advanced, their cause. They
demand a "right of return" that no Israeli government could ever possibly
grant.
Don't the American Indians have an equal right to return to their old homes
across the U.S.? Yet the U.S. government would never grant this in a million
years. American Indians don't stay at war with the U.S. government, vow to
demolish the U.S., and strap explosives to themselves to kill innocent men,
women, and children!
To the West, Palestinians and their sympathizers have no moral credibility
to condemn Israel if and when they publicly celebrate the suicide bombings
of women and children! This is murder, not freedom-fighting!
The Palestinians need to accept Israel's basic existence. They do not need
to accept the Zionist idea that Jews have a "birthright" to Palestine. This
is a philosophical position, not a factual one. The Palestinians, however,
along with the rest of the Muslim world, needs to "come to terms" with
Israel's existence, even if they believe Israel should never have been
established in the first place, and stop the teaching of mindless hatred for
Israel that is all too common in the Muslim world today.
Furthermore, the whole Muslim preoccupation with Israel reeks in hypocrisy.
While Muslims condemn Israel incessantly for the Palestinian issue, they
usually totally ignore the massive human rights abuses in Muslim
countries. In 1988, Saddam Hussein murdered 5,000 Kurds with nerve gas.
Shi'a Muslims, who comprise 60 percent of Iraq's population, are harshly
persecuted. Yet where do you here Muslims protesting all this?
As M.A. Muqtedar Khan noted, "In many Persian Gulf countries, laws and even
salaries are based on ethnic origin. This is racism..." Yet why didn't we
hear Muslims protest these practices at the Durban conference on racism?
Instead, all of the focus was on condemning Israel as a "racist state."
Muslims frequently argue that the U.S. is hypocritical because it supports
"repressive regimes" in the Middle East, particularly Egypt and Saudi
Arabia. Yet how is the U.S. supposed to "stand up for democracy" in
dealing with countries that have never had any democratic traditions? Where
are the democrats in Egypt and Saudi Arabia? As Fouad Ajami notes, the Arab
world has "...had authoritarian regimes since the dawn of its history." If
the Egyptian and Saudi governments were toppled, we would likely see
Taliban-style regimes take their place. They would be more oppressive than
the existing order, not less.
It is not America's moral responsibility to create or foster "free
societies" in the Muslim world. This is the responsibility of Muslims
themselves. In addition, American leaders have a right and a duty to put
their nations' self-interest first in formulating foreign policy -- as do
the leaders of every other nation. This does not mean that nations should
only care about themselves, but it does mean they can't do what others
want without looking out for their own interests.
Until the Muslim world looks within and stops the "blame game" of
scapegoating the U.S. and Israel for its problems, it will never reclaim the
greatness it once enjoyed. A thousand years ago, the Muslim world led
humanity in scientific achievement.
Today, Israel alone has nearly twice as many scientists as all Muslim
countries put together. This cannot be explained by American foreign policy
or Israel. Rather, it is a clear signal that Muslims must look inward in
order to reclaim their societies.

<b>Hi Lucide
Firstly, I did not say Bin Laden supports Palestinian authority directly, I said he is funding suicide bombers directly. So is the Saudi government.
AS for your claim of "forgery". How do you know where the truth is?  Maybe the other side does forgery too? Can you honestly say you know for sure? My proof is that I have seen a movie with my own eyes, not a document, where Arafat clearly admits that he supports terror, not as a lost resort from occupation. He clearly says one thing to CNN and another to his people. This is Arafat directly, not some one quoting him. If you wish to see the movie, I WILL WITH PLEASURE FIND OUT AND LET YOU KNOW.  Anything is possible. If this movie is a forgery, there was a genius at doing Arafat's voice and synchronizing it perfectly, better than any movie I have seen.
No, Personally I do support taking the Golan. The sniper fire from Syria is 100% recorded. The Israelis who had to run for their lives were not fabricating it. Israel never once claimed Golan is part of Israel. Even the fundamentaliests who believe in a greater Israel stretching to Iraq, do not. They see it as a buffer of security. It can be returned, pending a peace settlement from Syria. It also just so happens of all the Arab countries Israel was at war with, Syria had the worse cruelty. eg Egypt kept to geneva conventions with POWs. Syria, the torture was too terrible eg the dead Israeli soldeirs found had scrotums down their throat and torture on their bodies. I do not see Golan as occupied. The Isralis who oppose giving it back are not from any "zionist teachings" it's from nightmares of running for their lives. Can you give me more examples of "Israeli forgery" that it's a speciality. eg The Palestinians claimed a massacre. Every independent survey showed Israel did violate rights, but agreed there was no massacre.
AS for the soldiers who refuse to serve in the territories, I will take any bet, that if you went to them and said "Are you a Zionist", I will bet 99% if not 100% will say "Yes, I'm a Zionist".
Just for the records:
1)I do support Israel taking Golan. Not forever, returning pending security.
2)I do support Israel having captured Wesbank.
3)I do not support Israel having kept the Wesbank.
4)I do not agree with how Israel ruled the Wesbank
Ironically, you can debate my opinions, but they have nothing to do with me being a Zionist. Seeing that you know about Jays, let me try impress you. If I remember correctly, Geneva is near the border, it's the French speaking area of Switzerland. I remember a long river/lake with pretty large ships, pontoons and bridges over it.
The station is in walking distance from this long lake.
Is my memory correct? Also, the provinces are called Cantons!

<b>Hi Peter,
I hope you had a little prayer for those suffering in Palestine while watching your Sunday's ballgame. I can cite many interesting things you said that we agree upon: 1. you're against settlers. 2. you hate Sharon. and 3. you do not support the latest invasion. I share these 3 points simply because occupation is NOT right, force will not serve trust but keep tensions alive, and justice will soon or later prevail. However, I cannot agree with the occupation of the Golan Heights because what you advanced is a "pietre" excuse and because it's also an occupation...!..I do not see a link between Bin Laden and the Palestinian authority because forgery of facts and proofs has always been an Israeli's specialty. Finally, I stick with the fact that Israel is the lone renegade state in the world, thanks to the lone support of the US. I do however believe it will change one of these days, as powers end up falling. All Jews supporting occupation are acting against the basic foundations of human rights, so I praise those 460 or so IDF soldiers who refuse to serve in the occupied territories (see IDF refusnik site which also include pretty interesting statements). As to go back to baseball, I am a O's fan...O's like birds, birds like a symbol for a JUST peace. </b><br>

<b>While Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat yesterday renewed his English-language bid to be seen as a peacemaker in a New York Times opinion piece, two compelling new video documentaries produced in France using footage from Palestinian television and other sources suggest he is employing a strategy of saying one thing while doing another. 
"Israel and the War of Images" and "The Trojan Horse," both produced in France with English and French dubbing and subtitles show Arafat and his spokesmen, clerics and negotiators revealing that peace negotiations with Israel are part of a strategy leading ultimately and inevitably to the destruction of the Jewish state. 
The video documentaries include clips from 1994 through 1999 of the top Palestinian spokesmen all candidly explaining this strategy to Arabic audiences. All of the comments were made after the signing of the Oslo Accords in which Arafat pledged to renounce violence against Israel and to promote mutual respect between the negotiating parties. 
"All these elements will push us continuously toward our goals," explains Nabil Sha'ath, Arafat's chief negotiator, in 1999. "We still haven't lost hope (of achieving the ultimate objectives.) We are not waiving our rights. Who told you we are waiving our rights? On the contrary, we demand more. We have moved from demanding limited autonomy, and later we said we would not accept less than an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital. Have our expectations decreased. No, they have increased." 
Arafat himself explains the ploy in a 1994 speech in South Africa. 
"I don't consider the agreement any more than the agreement which was signed by our prophet Mohammad and the Qurayish," he said. 
Mohammad signed a peace agreement with the Qurayish Jews who lived in Mecca, until his Islamic warriors were strong enough to conquer them. 
Over and over again, Palestinian leaders explain that their ultimate goals remain a Palestine from "the sea to the river" – meaning from the Jordan to the Mediterranean. 
The documentaries, which are now being distributed in the U.S. exclusively through WorldNetDaily's online store, ShopNetDaily, also show Arafat calling for jihad and total victory over Israel, his spokesmen denying the reality of the Jewish Holocaust, the training of Arab children as young as 4 years old in commando-style warfare and the indoctrination of the young in martyrdom. 
"Jews are Jews," shouts one of Arafat's clerics in a Friday sermon broadcast on Palestinian television. "Amongst those are no moderates, nor peace partisans. They are all liars. They must be massacred; they must be killed. Allah the Almighty said, 'Fight them. That's what the Jews are. Have no pity for them, wherever they are, in whatever country. Fight them wherever you are. Wherever you meet them, kill them." 
The documentaries combine these powerful images and words with confrontations never before seen between reporters questioning Arafat on his deliberate use of children in his uprising or "intifada" against Israel. 
"Can you prove it?" he demands. "Can you prove it?" 
Palestinian children are shown getting summer camp demonstrations in assassination techniques and firearms training. 
The children explain themselves what they are taught – that the Jews are the enemy and must be killed. 
Yesterday the New York Times published an opinion piece by Arafat in which he claims he condemns the recent terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens. He also maintains his goal remains a Palestinian state living side by side with Israel as an equal and peaceful neighbor.

<b>The person below says to read books by Noam Chomsky. There we go, it's always the non-zionists who must scrape out individuals to prove a point, unlike the other person who says "goto ANY zionist convention". Look at the difference of evidence!!
Noam Chomsky is shunned by nearly every Zionist I have ever met. I would not believe that person with a grain of acid. He is the one who perverts Zionism. I am sure anyone who reads his writings will get a perverted picture of Zionism. I prefer the Zionist approach, goto RANDOM Zionist meetings/people, not ones conveniently selected.</b><br>

<b>`ILLEGALLY OCCUPIED Palestinian territories." That is the mantra that is repeated with such regularity by Arab spokespersons. Even U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, speaking on March 12, called upon Israel to "end the illegal occupation." The term brings to mind what was often labelled the "Holy Roman Empire," which was neither holy, Roman nor an empire. Similarly, since the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, much has been made of Israel's alleged "illegal occupation" of the West Bank of the Jordan River, territory often referred to erroneously as "Palestinian lands." This fallacy remains in use notwithstanding the reality that Israel's administration of these disputed lands commencing in 1967 was neither an "occupation" as the term is understood legally, "illegal" under well settled international practice, nor exercised over "Palestinian lands." Still, the language of "illegal occupation" remains prominent and forms an integral part of a highly misleading discourse on the continuing conflict. More disconcerting is that this story continues to be uncritically received even in the period following Oslo, which witnessed an end to the Israeli military administration and the creation of a Palestinian Authority that was given complete administrative control over the most densely populated parts of the disputed lands. Long before the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising in 2000, 98 per cent of the Palestinian population in the West Bank and Gaza Strip was under the administration of the Palestinian Authority. This caused legal counsel to the International Red Cross to conclude that the Red Cross had no reason to monitor Israeli compliance with the Fourth Geneva Convention, which only applied to an occupying power. Under Article 6 of the Fourth Geneva Convention (1949), for territory to be considered "occupied," one state must first exercise legally recognized sovereignty over the territory and it is only when that territory has come under the control of a second state through force that the territory can properly be considered occupied. Once occupation has been established, it may be legal or illegal depending on the circumstances. For example, it is well settled international practice that territory taken in a defensive war may be legally occupied until suitable arrangements, such as a peace treaty, are made to terminate the hostilities on a permanent basis. In cases where mere de facto control of territory has been taken away from a state whose sovereignty over the territory was never recognized (such as Jordan's rejected claim to sovereignty over the West Bank between 1948 and 1967), the territory is not properly described as occupied, but rather is disputed territory until its status is resolved through negotiations.  The present conflict involves disputed rather than occupied territories  
In most recent international conflicts over land, the term occupied territory has not been employed. Examples include Kashmir, Nagorno-Karabakh, the Western Sahara, Zubarah, the Kurile Islands, and Abu Musa. Therefore, applying correct legal principles, it is fair to say that the present Israeli-Palestinian conflict involves disputed rather than occupied territories. Respecting the true legal situation, U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, still the operative formula for peace, does not require a complete Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 borders, but rather a withdrawal "from territories" to "secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force." Implicitly the Security Council acknowledged that to enhance its security, Israel is entitled to retain part of the territory that came under its control during the Six Day War in the context of a permanent peace settlement. Jordan's grab of the West Bank during Israel's 1948 War of Independence was never recognized internationally. Then in 1967, Israel, defending itself against an attack from Jordan, gained control of the territory. The nature of Israel's position in relation to the territories taken from Jordan in that war was accurately described by former U.S. State Department Legal Adviser Stephen Schwebel in 1970 when he stated: "Where the prior holder of territory had seized that territory unlawfully, the state which subsequently takes that territory in the lawful exercise of self-defence has, against that prior holder, better title." While the term "occupation" is generally recognized legally as applying to territory and not to populations, if the Palestinians are indeed "occupied" in this latter sense, the culprit since at least 1995 is the Palestinian Authority and not Israel. Indeed the notion that the Palestinian people are "illegally occupied by Israel" is a smokescreen to divert attention from the shameful neglect of their interests by a Palestinian Authority that has encouraged terrorism, pursued policies that inhibit economic growth and social development, and which evaded a commitment to hold elections in 1999. In fact, since its establishment in 1994, the Palestinian Authority has been the greatest oppressor of the very people it was supposedly intended to liberate. It has redirected funds from outside donors that were destined for humanitarian purposes into the development of a terrorist infrastructure. Corruption is rampant with funds from the international community often ending up in private bank accounts. Kangaroo courts and summary executions are used to punish those suspected of co-operating with Israel. The spectacle of several victims of Palestinian justice being dragged through the streets recently was widely observed. The egregious policy of deliberately locating terrorist installations and personnel in densely populated urban areas is a Palestinian Authority practice that not only exposes its own people to grave risk but also violates the 1977 Geneva Conventions. This practice is referred to as "perfidy" under the laws of war and is considered a war crime by authorities on international law. In sum, the Palestinian people have been suffering terribly at the hands of the Palestinian Authority.  Why are so many so eager to accuse Israel of humanitarian violations  
This begs the question: Why are there so many in the international community who are so eager to accuse Israel of humanitarian violations but who would never consider such accusations against the effective occupier, the Palestinian Authority? One reason is the widely held false belief that at the root of the conflict is an "illegal occupation" — a term that resonates with an almost surreal power given its association with the evils of the Nazi occupation of Europe and with European colonialism. Indeed, the unrelenting misuse of the term as an accusation to describe Israel's actions has served the ends of those who would seek to isolate Israel.

<b>Hi Lucid
Well done for knowing about the Jays. One up on you.
I agree with you, it's easy to talk here in TO. Luckily we do not suffer like other people. That is why I'm a Zionist, else I will continue life here and forget about others.
I am happy to discuss all the issues you mention. There many things Israel did which I agree with and disagree with. eg in my opinion, I am very much against the settlers. I see them the biggest obstacle to peace. They may disagree, but they believe it's the word of God. I met one and he honestly believes it's the word of God to that he should live there.
On the other hand, I do believe Israel was right to capture the Golan Heights. I met many peole who lived in the Galilee who had to flea from sniper fire from Syria. Capturing the Golan was a last resort.
There is plenty I do not agree with Israel. In my opinion, I hate Sharon with a passion. Mutually, I hate Arafat with a passion too.
We can discuss everything. You welcome to disagree with my opinions, however, MY OPINIONS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ME BEING A ZIONIST. My political opinions are exactly that, my opinions.
I have never done a survey what percentage of Zionists agree/disagree with all the many issues. That however, is their own personal opinion.
My claim about going to conventions AT RANDOM, not specifically chosen by me, I do not see as splitting hair reasoning. Here in Toronto, just as other parts of the world, at the Zionist conventions, there is no specific political opinion.
You are taking what you disagree with and calling it Zionist.
Just for the records, Israel's present invasion of the Wesbank, I do not  support it, but not 100% against it either, given that Israel is up against a regime being funded by Bin Laden's group who encourage suicide bombers, well documented. Here again, it's a personal opinion, nothing to do with me being a Zionist.
If Zionism means land confiscation and hurting others as you purport, then in that case, most Arab leaders are Zionists. The rulers of Australia are Zionists. Practically most countries in the world are ruled by Zionists.
What about the Blue Jays? I guess I will get a specialist to analyze them. The bad ones I will call Zionists. Peter</b><br>

<b>Dear Peter,
I judge what people do not what they say. The reality is that the state which was created on the basis of a doctrine called Zionism has since its creation, under various governments using all available means, followed the same path of killing, destroying and occupying. So, if 99% of Zionists in the world are pro-peace as you said, it looks like only 1% have ruled or supported Israel since 1948, which would be very doubtful..!!!...having said that, I do not think we will ever agree since I am siding with the oppressed, like those who are hosting this great web site and whom I pay respect for their dedication and courage, and support their just cause, while you tend to excuse if not support those responsible for their miserable fate...So, while enjoying comfortably numb a Jays' ballgame this WE, have just a second prayer for living in peaceful Toronto, and another one for those hungry and wounded survivors in Jenine or Ramallah for whom, the doctrine you support has left them with no land, shelter, food and future, begging the world to tell them why for the eternity they'll have to suffer the loss of their beloved ones.

<b>I was reading the dialogue below. I tend lean slightly towards Peter.
Firstly, a characteristic of both Arabs and Jews, is that they only find out the wrongs done by the other leader, not their own. They only attend meetings or be on the emailing list (the new way of sending info) that shows up the other side. That is not so much an Arab/Jewish issue, it is a characteristic of humans. I don't agree with it, it's human nature. I can have excellent evidence to show up one side, if I only listen to the speakers who promote that side. Very seldom have I been to a meeting anywhere where they invite a speaker to explain why their own side is in the wrong.
I will say this. Here in Sidney, I have met numerous Zionists. Most are pro-Israel and believe Israel's present actions are justified given the situation. I will admit though, it's most, not all. Their opinions in general differ.
The reason why I tend towards Peter is I find those who dislike Zionism, attach the word "Zionism" to what is bad or the word "Zionist" to a person they disagree with. For example, me personally, I agree with some things Israel does and disagree with others. Whenever I write into a guestbook where I agree with Israel, the next person labels me a "Zionist". I guess if my opinions are split, I'm a semi-Zionist.</b><br>

Zionist Leader Says Peace Not Possible with Shamir 
There can be no peace for Israel "as long as Yitzhak Shamir and his Likud party control Israeli foreign policy," wrote Menachem Rosensaft in an op-ed piece appearing in The New York Times Feb. 28. Rosensaft, president of the Labor Zionist Alliance and founder of the International Network of Jewish Holocaust Survivors, was one of five American Jews who met with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat last December in Stockholm. He and the others in his delegation were branded as "dupes" by some leaders of the US Jewish establishment and Rosensaft was almost ousted from the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. 
"Israelis like Prime Minister (Yitzhak) Shamir and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens believe that the Jewish people have a God-given right to all of the biblical 'Land of Israel,' which they define as including the West Bank and Gaza Strip, " Rosensaft wrote. Likud leaders "understand that the very act of talking to the PLO implies an acknowledgment of precisely those Palestinian nationalist aspirations that are incompatible with their absolutist vision of a 'Greater Israel."' Shamir is unlikely to "present a credible peace proposal when he visits Washington this spring," Rosensaft argued, since unlike Labor leaders Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, Shamir does not support the principle of exchanging territory for peace.

<b>I support Zionism. I was watching the debate below and cannot believe how many people are subject to anti-zionist propaganda.
Why is it that 99% of every Zionist I have ever met promotes peace? 
Zionism is a peaceful movement saying "Jews will establish a homeland in Palestine". Look in ANY DICTIONARY.
If any person wishes to pervert Zionism or commit atrocities in the name of Zionism, it is reprehensible, but it is THEIR INTERPRETATION. Zionism does not stipulate where the borders should be eg
Some Zionists say pre-67 borders.
Fundamentalists say Biblical definition.
Other Zionists say 1948 borders will suffice. Some Zionist don't really believe in establishing the state of Israel, but Zionists in principle i.e. seeing the homeland there but not really doing it. 
It is the same analogy of the person who wrote in before me. We can agree/disagree over everything of the Israeli government historically or presently. That is however just that, decisions of the government. There many things done by the government that I agree with and disagree with. My opinions with all those issues though, have nothing to do with me being a Zionist. P.S. I also went to university in Canada and asked many Arab students to give me a reason why they hate Zionism. Not one responded. </b><br>

Firstly any history book can tell you Zionism started long before the Holocaust. It cannot therefore use the Holocaust.
Secondly, the claims of uprooting etc has nothing to do with zionism. Let us say the Paletinians want a homeland. It just so happens they get one. The ruler happens to be a brutal dictator. Does that mean Palestinian nationalism is racist? No, it means the leader happens to be like that. We can discuss and agree/disagree about Israel's policies. It has nothing to do with Zionism. Zionism says establish a homeland. It does not say how. eg anti-abortionim means no abortions. If some one decided to murder to fight abortion, that is his/her interpretation.. What about the millions of Zionists who promote peace and help the poor? I believe many of your claims are out of context, as I don't know if you know how many injustices were committed on Israelis.

<b>Hi Peter,
I think you said it all: Zionism says that "Jews establish a homeland in Palestine"...I would add: "by all means even if this requires to kill or expell native people, destroy trees and houses,seize water resources and land by force, massacre people, hide facts and behave like a renegade state which doesn't care about the world as long as US taxpayers continue to finance expansion". You see, everything starts from taking for granted the right to estblish this Jewish state on a land that pertains to others. Even the initial partition of the land was not fair: the fertile big shunk of it to a small number of immigrants (settlers), the less fertile and smaller shunk to a large number of inhabitants. So, is this enough for you to understand why "they" are against Zionism?..Now arguing whether Israel is defenceable (To Greg too)seems to me a mere joke when you've got the 4th military build up in the world, nuclear capabilities in the Neguev that no one could inspect (remind me of Iraq!), and the full support of the 1st military power in the world...all this, against rifles at best, stones at worst..you make me laugh...!!?!..Regarding the Arabs and your insinuation that they may pose a threat to Israel, I think it's another laughter....it's one of the 2 best propaganda tools Zionists have been raising up to continue their crusade on the land (the other is the Holocaust): My dear, Arab rulers are more concerned about containing their people and assuring a long stand in power with the US help, that Israel can sleep without any worry...The only danger facing Israel will be over the long-term, a fall of the US and/or the awakening of the Muslim conscience and this shall happen but not soon. Some Jewish extremists against Israel will add another possibilty: settling in one land will lead to total destruction. AS for Chomsky, I was referring to the fact that you said having read Fateful Triangle "many times" not whether you agree or not (I am smart enough to guess you don't agree!). Regards. PS: thanks Colin and Greg for your comments although from what I just wrote, I cannot agree....Btw Colin, I wish if NY Zionists allocate some of their huge wealth dedicated to charity to the kids of Jenine..it would be a hell of a charity gesture, don't you think so...?</b><br>

Israel believes with an 8 mile width at the thinnest point is indefensible, especially when every 2nd person in the country has lost a child/brother/parent from war. It is easy for me to argue with the Israelis here in Toronto, as I have not lived through a war.
We can discuss as much as we wish about the 8 mile width if it is defenceable or not.
What has that got to do with Zionism though???
Zionism is a movement that says "Jews establish a homeland in Palestine". Look in ANY DICTIONARY. How the Jew wishes to then interpret it is his/her decesion.
eg person A might say by force
person B might say in a passive way
We can discuss agree/disagree the peace plans, what's that got to do with Zionism???

All the Palestinian hospitals have open fronts, the outside-walls have been destroyed. So one can see all what happens inside, not any intimacy between the doctor and his patient. Maybe that Dr. Zangen was too occupied by saving the palestinian population that he did not see the demonstrations of Palestinian hospital-staff who were forbidden to enter and to work. So - all the foreigner persons who were admitted to visit the destroyed sites - they all are telling lies  -  nothing wrong to see, nothing wrong to smell ?

<b>I noticed all this discussion about Zionism. I agree with Peter. Every Zionist meeting I went to, promoted understanding and hearing all views.
A perfect example, was in Summer of 1991 I attended a Zionist conference in Arad in Israel/Palestine. Who was one of the guest speakers at the Zionist conference? It was Ahmed Tibi, who is chief advisor for Yasser Arafat. Not every person there supported Tibi, but that was their opinion. The Zionist convention itself, was niether for or against Tibi. The convention had no specific political opinion. It invited as many speakers as possible, to be a proper Zionist meeting. By all means, if anyone knows Tibi, contact and ask him.</b><br>

<b>My dear Mr Lucide, I have read Chomsky's book many times. I think you fell for the same propaganda as him.
Thousands upon thousands of Zionists promote peace. That man writes a book, so I must now conclude otherwise.
Why is it that every single Zionist meeting I have ever attended, in many major city of the world eg LA, New York, Montreal, Toronto, in Europe too, does every person promote peace, understanding, welcome analytical debate. Zionist ideology is about welcoming many opinions (unlike many countries in the Middle East). Saying "look what those Zionists did" is like saying "Islam promotes flying planes into buildings".
This promoting peace is not just Toronto. When I was in Europe, every single Zionist I met, promoted understanding and abhored human suffering.</b><br>

I do agree with you Sir...Most Zionists promote peace, but THEIR peace...evasively, they will tell you they're pro-peace..that kind of peace that would guarantee their own security only and who cares about those "dirty Palestinians"..!..I said "most", because there is indeed a minority which cares about the rights of the oppressed and I praise their high moral standards. Look Sir, try to trace the Zionist ideology back from the early years and you'll see it's always been based on racism, crualty and immorality. I take this opportunity to invite everyone to read "Fateful Triangle" by Noam Chomsky, which gives historical facts about this.

<b>Dr.  David Zangen, a senior paediatrician at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, who received his mobilization order for army service in Jenin, did not think that he would also be recruited for Israel's information campaign. Normally, he is a calm person, but the accusations made by the UN Special Envoy to the Middle East, Terje Larsen, regarding a "massacre" supposedly carried out by Israel in Jenin have infuriated him.  Dr.  Zangen could not restrain himself, and called the Israel Army Radio service, to protest Larsen's charges.
Dr.  Zangen's comments are particularly significant, because he treated both wounded Israelis and Palestinians with great dedication.  In this way, Dr.  Zangen became a spokesman for the IDF, for one day. His account sheds a little light on what really happened in the refugee camp.
"I was incensed by Larsen's remarks.  He must not be allowed to continue with these lies," stated Dr.  Zangen to Ma'ariv.  "I was there during the fighting, and I saw close up what was happening.  I know that the IDF did everything it could to prevent civilian casualties.
It is clear to everyone that if the IDF had resorted to aerial bombardment or heavy artillery, we would have completed [our mission] in the refugee camp within half a day, without suffering any casualties on our side.  We did not adopt that policy, and we took risks in the fighting, in an attempt to rescue those innocent civilians that were caught up in the battles.  Anyone who says that Israel carried out a massacre is lying and inciting the Arabs.
Instead of acting to bring about reconciliation and peace, Larsen is creating hatred."
Dr.  Zangen continued, "IDF soldiers did not enter the Jenin hospital, and ensured that the hospital could operate without disruption.  No IDF soldier set foot in the hospital.  The Palestinians hid there in the knowledge that we would not enter.  Everyone knows this, and anyone who says otherwise is lying and inciting.  The descriptions of the smell of the bodies in the refugee camp are also exaggerated out of all proportion.  A week after the fighting, I walked around the camp without a mask, with journalists from all over the world, and there was no smell.  The journalists knew this, but all of a sudden, they claimed that there was a stench in the camp from bodies that had not been evacuated.  Twenty-five bodies were found altogether, and most of the bodies were those of the terrorists.  There may have been one area in the entire camp in which there were a number of bodies buried under the rubble, and this would explain the smell.  However, aside from this case, there was no smell in the refugee camp - this is just a crude lie."
Dr.  Zangen, who found himself in the eye of the storm, is appalled at the attempt to portray the IDF as an immoral army.  "There are those who say that the events in Jenin were like a holocaust.  However, if you were to enter the camp, you would find that only a few dozen homes were destroyed.  These were homes that were booby-trapped for the purpose of killing soldiers.  This was a fortress of terrorism.  200 terrorists wired up the camp with booby-traps, they took control of it and recruited suicide bombers at every opportunity.  In recent years, a third of the suicide bombers have come from the Jenin refugee camp.  We found photo albums with pictures of children wearing explosive belts; studio photographs of future shahidim [martyrs], children aged between 16 and 18, who want to kill Israelis in suicide attacks.  All the homes in the refugee camp are covered with wall-to-wall pictures of martyrs.  It is unbelievable.  These [martyrs] are their heroes.
Their aim was to carry out suicide attacks against the IDF soldiers.
If there were innocent civilians in the area, they were either the hostages of the terrorists or collaborators.  In any case, during each stage of the fighting, we called out to all those who did not want to fight - to leave the homes.  The terrorists exploited the departure of these people, and they were shooting at us."
Dr.  Zangen is a doctor of the brigade that fought in Jenin, and treated many of the wounded.  "The soldiers fought without harming civilians", he stated.  "This was noticeable in every place and on every level.  I was moved by the sight of soldiers conducting themselves in such a dignified and moral manner.  Most of us are reserve soldiers; we are not hot-headed people, and we were all very careful.  I was impressed by the great care exercised by the IDF in avoiding civilian casualties - especially with regard to children.
The resolve and volunteering spirit also impressed me.  They were all ready to fight, and no one shirked their duties.  The Unit and Divisional Commanders who fought there are the crème de la crème of the Israeli people, and it is thanks to them that we are still alive.  They did not lose their humanity."
"I am infuriated by the claims of a massacre in Jenin, for another reason.  The paramedics and I risked our lives to treat the wounded Palestinians.  As well as the wounded, we also treated the sick.  The Palestinian doctors did not come to their aid, and we could not leave them without medical treatment.  The Palestinian doctors were unable to reach a girl who had an attack of appendicitis.  The soldiers brought the girl over to us and we treated her.  In another case, a youngster came to us with a neck wound.  We saved his life, in spite of his Islamic Jihad tattoo.  We tried to provide full treatment for every Palestinian, and I am proud of it.  I am in no doubt: the Americans would not have taken such risks, and would have acted differently.  We acted in this way, simply to avoid civilian casualties."
Hodi Broker from Haifa, a thirty-year-old teaching assistant from Technion university, who served as a paramedic in a field hospital, also talks about the treatment of the Palestinians: "an elderly person who was wounded in the refugee camp came to us.  We treated him, and we wanted to send him back to Jenin, but there was nowhere for him [to receive treatment].  The 'Red Crescent' refused to take him.  We took pity on him and we transported him to a hospital in Israel.  I hope he is well."
Dr.  Zangen, the father of four children, fought in Lebanon, and this is the first time that he is on the battlefield serving as a doctor. "When you are serving as a doctor, your perspective is completely different.  It was difficult for me to witness soldiers being hit by mass murderers who have no red lines, and who are even prepared to exploit children.  I saw pictures of children who were ready to carry out suicide attacks.  As a paediatrician, it was terrible to see such a thing, and I am appalled by the very thought of a killing machine that exploits innocent children.  For instance, soldiers encountered a six year-old boy who ran into the street with a bag.  They wanted to check the contents of the bag, and he threw the bag at them.  There were three pipe bombs in the bag.  One other difficult problem is the treatment of wounded fellow-soldiers from the unit.  It is a traumatic experience."
As the senior doctor on the ground, Zangen was forced to make difficult decisions - who should be treated on the ground?  Who should be evacuated?  When should treatment be abandoned, and be provided to another wounded [soldier]?  "These are difficult moments, in which the fate of friends is determined.  All the time, you are also aware that these people are reservists, with families, who were among the living, and all of a sudden, they are killed or wounded.  And then, you are not only thinking about them, but also thinking about the widow and the orphaned children left at home."
Dr.  Zangen has returned to Hadassah hospital, but the images of the battlefield are still fresh in his mind.  He talks of the courage and the steadfastness of the wounded soldiers.  "Some of these wounds were so severe, that I thought that they would be unable to withstand the pain.  The soldiers suffered in silence, displaying true courage.  They knew why they were fighting.  I remember a soldier who was hit by a bullet in the stomach, and who suffered excruciating pain.  Yet he wanted to know when he was going back into battle.  The Israeli people need to know that we have a noble generation that we can all rely upon."</b><br>

<b>Dear all of you. I am very impressed by this site, and your culture. I read that the IDF has plundered the culture center. I cant express my feelings, how can they do that? I am not impressed the way things are goin, with their aparheidsystem, with their constant oppressing, humiliation, killing. This has gone too far, UN has to force themself into Jenin, to every city and camp in palestinian areas to do a research. I have never seen a socalled democracy are keeping a political leader in prison (Arafat) in exchange for other prisoners, that is illegal in other democracys, i tell you, that could never happen in a real DEMOCRACY! And i am living in a REAL democracy. All the acts of war and crimes committed by IDF is faaar beyond a democracy, as far behind as it can be. Please Israel, and your government, please do not abuse the dear word: "democacy" about yourself, when you show that you are a democracay - then you can come back if you have something reasonable to say.

<b>It is not America's moral responsibility to create or
foster "free societies" in the Muslim world. This is the responsibility of Muslims themselves
A whiny, self-pitying, narcissistic Muslim victimology characterizes most of the dialogue emanating from the Muslim world today. This is what I usually hear when I listen to Muslims discuss the problems within their societies as
well as with the West.
Muslims are always the victims, never the perpetrators. They bear no
responsibility for their predicaments. The world is a morality play, in
which Muslims have been cast as the victims, and the West, particularly the U.S. and Israel, as the villains.
This victimology mentality, not U.S. foreign policy or Israel, is the root
cause of the backward, oppressive condition the Muslim world finds itself in
today.
Since September 11th, countless people have argued that American foreign
policy mistakes caused the terrorism and hatred toward America emanating from the Middle East. This is simply a cop-out. It is hogwash.
American foreign policy has had many flaws around the world. Yet other parts
of the world, particularly Southeast Asia and Latin America, have suffered
far more from U.S. foreign policy than has the Middle East!
Even during the Vietnam War, however, it was rare to find a Vietnamese who
hated America itself, as it is clear many Muslims do today. If U.S. foreign
policy toward Muslims caused the terrorism of September 11th, why didn't
U.S. misdeeds in Vietnam, Cambodia, Nicaragua, etc., cause any terrorism?
Over and over again, Muslims put U.S. support of Israel at the top of their
grievances. There is much to criticize in Israel's treatment of the
Palestinians -- particularly the greedy, provocative building of Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories. Yet there is much to criticize the
Palestinians and their Arab neighbors for as well.
Many Palestinians were expelled from their homes in 1947-8 (although many
others chose to leave). Yet why couldn't their Arab neighbors take them
in -- just as Israel took in Jews forcibly expelled from Arab countries?
The Arab states cynically chose to have the Palestinians be perpetual
"refugees" as a pawn to use against Israel. People are often expelled or
displaced from their homelands during war, and politically sympathetic
countries take them in all the time -- witness the immigration of many South
Vietnamese to America after the fall of South Vietnam.
The Palestinians now have a national identity of their own. Yet what are
they doing to gain their independence? Instead of skillfully using diplomacy
as well as nonviolent resistance, like Gandhi did in India, they commit
themselves to a hopeless struggle against Israel.
They send their children out to blow themselves up in pointless suicide
bombings that have set back, rather than advanced, their cause. They demand
a "right of return" that no Israeli government could ever possibly grant.
Don't the American Indians have an equal right to return to their old homes
across the U.S.? Yet the U.S. government would never grant this in a million
years. American Indians don't stay at war with the U.S. government, vow to
demolish the U.S., and strap explosives to themselves to kill innocent men,
women, and children!
To the West, Palestinians and their sympathizers have no moral credibility
to condemn Israel if and when they publicly celebrate the suicide bombings of women and children! This is murder, not freedom-fighting!
The Palestinians need to accept Israel's basic existence. They do not need
to accept the Zionist idea that Jews have a "birthright" to Palestine. This is a philosophical position, not a factual one.
The Palestinians, however, along with the rest of the Muslim world, needs to
"come to terms" with Israel's existence, even if they believe Israel should
never have been established in the first place, and stop the teaching of
mindless hatred for Israel that is all too common in the Muslim world today.
Furthermore, the whole Muslim preoccupation with Israel reeks in hypocrisy.
While Muslims condemn Israel incessantly for the Palestinian issue, they
usually totally ignore the massive human rights abuses in Muslim countries
In 1988, Saddam Hussein murdered 5,000 Kurds with nerve gas. Shi'a Muslims,
who comprise 60 percent of Iraq's population, are harshly persecuted. Yet
where do you here Muslims protesting all this?
As M.A. Muqtedar Khan noted, "In many Persian Gulf countries, laws and even
salaries are based on ethnic origin. This is racism..." Yet why didn't we
hear Muslims protest these practices at the Durban conference on racism?
Instead, all of the focus was on condemning Israel as a "racist state."
Muslims frequently argue that the U.S. is hypocritical because it supports
"repressive regimes" in the Middle East, particularly Egypt and Saudi
Arabia. Yet how is the U.S. supposed to "stand up for democracy" in dealing
with countries that have never had any democratic traditions? Where are the
democrats in Egypt and Saudi Arabia?
As Fouad Ajami notes, the Arab world has "...had authoritarian regimes since
the dawn of its history." If the Egyptian and Saudi governments were
toppled, we would likely see Taliban-style regimes take their place. They
would be more oppressive than the existing order, not less.
It is not America's moral responsibility to create or foster "free
societies" in the Muslim world. This is the responsibility of Muslims
themselves. In addition, American leaders have a right and a duty to put
their nations' self-interest first in formulating foreign policy -- as do
the leaders of every other nation. This does not mean that nations should
only care about themselves, but it does mean they can't do what others want
without looking out for their own interests.
Until the Muslim world looks within and stops the "blame game" of
scapegoating the U.S. and Israel for its problems, it will never reclaim the
greatness it once enjoyed. A thousand years ago, the Muslim world led
humanity in scientific achievement.
Today, Israel alone has nearly twice as many scientists as all Muslim
countries put together. This cannot be explained by American foreign policy
or Israel. Rather, it is a clear signal that Muslims must look inward in
order to reclaim their societies.

<b>To the person who wrote about the Saudi Embassador concerning his poem....you're opinions do not belong on this site. Your attacks are not welcome here. You do not wish to understand anything, you just want to lecture your point of view without discussing anything with others. You cannot and should not expect people, especially Arabs, to listen to what you have to say without opening their hearts, their minds and their souls to respond to your viciousness.
No one condemned Johnny Cash when he wrote his song saying that he "shot a man in Reno". No one condemned Tupac Shakur when he wrote about using an automatic machine gun to kill people, no one condemned Marilyn Manson for writing his song "Get your Gun" in which he talks about beating housewives and raping women, as well as naming himself after your own Charles Manson, a failed rockstar-wannabe turned psycho killer.
No one condemned Pat Robertson for calling the Muslim religion evil and hate-filled in an attempt to start another Crusade in America against Arab and Muslim Americans. No one condemned Dr. Laura Schlessinger for claiming that Muslims are trying to take over the world much like Hitler tried to do.
So when you want Arabs to take repsonsibility for their own actions while pointing your finger at them, look at yourself first. There is a saying in Christianity that says, "Let he without Sin, cast the first stone". America and Israel have committed many sins against humanity and yet they continue to cast stones against the Middle East.

<b>IMAGINE, if you can, that the British ambassador to Washington wrote and published a poem praising the September 11 mass murderers. 
Or that the American consul in, say, Sydney paid public tribute to the Omagh bombers.
How long do you think they’d stay in their jobs? The US and Australian governments would put them on the first plane out.
They’d be drummed out of the diplomatic service pronto.
So why the hell is the Saudi ambassador to Britain still here?
Ghazi Algosaibi, Riyadh’s man in London, has just penned a poem eulogising the Palestinian bomber who blew herself up outside a supermarket, killing two Israelis and maiming many more.
He lavishes praise upon her and other Palestinian terrorists and rubbishes America and a “White House whose heart is filled with darkness”.
Algosaibi’s comments were published in a London-based Arab newspaper.
Why do we continue to give house room to these vile, seditious anti-Western, anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic publications and the terrorist supporters who produce them?
Ghazi ... penned poem 
Why have none of the mad mullahs in this country preaching death to the Jews and death to the Americans been prosecuted?
Why has that ridiculous E J Thribb character from the BBC’s arts review show not been charged under anti-terrorism laws for saying that Israeli settlers all deserve to be shot?
If he’d made similar remarks about blacks, or gays, or Moslems, he’d be sharing a cell with Jeffrey Archer at North Sea Camp.
Why do the race hate laws apply only to the knuckle-scraping scum of the BNP and not to those who peddle hatred and preach murder against the Jews, the Americans and the British?
The Foreign Office says it plans to “rebuke” Algosaibi.
Big deal.
But the pro-Arab FO will only tick him off for saying it in public, not for believing it.
If Jack Straw had any spine he would order Algosaibi out of the country. But we’re not talking Lord Palmerston here, are we?
It’s time we stopped sucking up to the Arab world and Saudi Arabia in particular.
Their oil wealth gives them a stranglehold. But it’s time the West weaned ourselves off the Saudi teat, used our own oil resources better, persuaded the Americans to downsize their monster SUVs and cut some deals with the Russians and Venezuela.
The Saudis are corrupt and duplicitous and serious sponsors of terrorism.
They even held a telethon to raise money for the families of Palestinian terrorists. (Can we please stop calling these murderers “suicide” bombers? I prefer the label given to them by Fox News in the US — “homicide bombers”.)
The majority of the September 11 terrorists were Saudi Arabian, as is Osama bin Laden. Saudi money funds al-Qa’ida and other terror networks.
The Saudi “peace plan” for the Israeli/Palestinian dispute is a sham. The same kind of deal was on offer a couple of years ago at Camp David.
Ehud Barak gave the Palestinians 95 per cent what they wanted and Arafat spat in his face, stomped off and ordered a fresh intifada.
Arafat is and remains a terrorist. He was hijacking planes when the September 11 killers weren’t even a twinkle in a virgin’s eye.
He is happy to send brainwashed young people to their deaths. Life is cheap in the Arab world.
The Palestinian Authority doesn’t want peace. In common with all other Arab countries it wants Israel wiped off the face of the Earth and all Jews killed.
That’s the reality that Israel is having to contend with. That and the grotesque wave of anti-Semitism once more engulfing the world.
Straw ... should order Algosaibi out of the UK
Picture: REUTERS/Thierry Roge 
Everyone with a shred of decency wants peace in the Middle East, but demonising and isolating Israel is not the way to go about it. The Colin Powell peace mission was well-intentioned but misguided.
Let’s agree that the West Bank settlements are a bridgehead too far.
But now explain how Israel is supposed to combat terrorism. The attacks in Jenin and elsewhere are not acts of aggression, they are acts of self-defence.
If civilians are getting killed that is because the terrorists use civilians as human shields. It is a deliberate ploy.
Why is the world so ready to denounce Israel and accept the Palestinian version of events?
Why were those who demanded an end to the bombing in Afghanistan for the Muslim religious festival of Ramadan silent over the Palestinian outrages during the Jewish Passover?
We expect no better from our European “partners”. Germany has plenty of previous. So does the Vatican. France is probably the most anti-Semitic nation on Earth outside the Arab world.
If France wasn’t responsible for the Holocaust it’s only because the Germans thought of it first. And there were plenty of willing collaborators queuing up to load the trains to Auschwitz.
Apres vous, monsieur.
But I don’t get the anti-Semitism in Britain, especially on the Left.
The Jewish community in this country is an enormous asset, punching way above its weight in business and the arts.
British Jews are well assimilated, contribute hugely and ask for nothing from the state. 
The Jews are a model for all other ethnic minorities.
They are right to be alarmed at the virulent anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic feeling growing in this country and elsewhere.
And they are entitled to the same safeguards and protection as anyone else.
Which means cracking down on those who peddle hatred against them and against Israel, their spiritual homeland.
It’s time friends of the Jewish community and of Israel spoke out. 
We don’t all think Israel is a pariah. We might not agree with all its policies but we do recognise it as the only civilised democracy in the Middle East and one which has the right to defend itself.
I was encouraged on my last visit to Ibrox to see the Israeli flag being flown behind the goal alongside the Union Flag, the Stars and Stripes and the Aussie flag. It was the first time I’d seen the Star of David flown at a football ground outside White Hart Lane.
The Government should give a lead. Let’s start by rounding up the mad mullahs, such as Captain Hook from Finsbury Park, and kicking them out.
And set an example to the Arab world by expelling the Saudi ambassador and his disgusting support for terror.

<b>Dear brothers and sisters,
i feel for you under occupation for 50yrs now. i feel for your children who are slaughtered endlessly by israeli troops, of our mothers who undergo daily humiliation(like giving birth at checkpoints for example), of the youth and the elderly, dispossesed, maimed, or killed. i cant understand how jewry that itself suffered persecution under eurochristendom can do the same to their kith and kin. yet i know these are zionists, what the world condemned as racism in Durban.
i know Sharon is a war criminal with blood on his hands right from Sabra and Chatilla in 1982(read Robert Frisk, Pity the Nation). he is doing the same now and Jenin was his latest act of genocide.
take heart my brothers, and those who desire peace israelis alike. i know voices of peace have been stifled by special murderous interests, and Sharon and Bush only know the 'Final Solution', the same that Hitler had.
in the end justice triumphs over injustice. keep the struggle alive. remember Mandela sacrificed 27 years for a principle, and a cause and he succeeded. did i mention Gandhi as well?

<b>In a first time, I wish to correct a vocabular-mistake in my message from 21st of April : of course,I mean destroy and not disturb...
re : to Avi Ben-Alazer - I think that you did not read with a big attention the other messages of this guest-book... You say that my lines are hateful, but there are others quite worse. And there are a lot of persons who approach the actual situation to what happened to you under Hitler and the Nazis. I can only repeat : I cannot understand how a people who had suffered so much as you, can do these terrible things to another people. There is not any personal interest for me - I have no friends in Palestine, neither in Israel. I am not hysterical, have no fanatic political ideas. If I take position for the Palestian People, I am only guided by my feelings - feelings of a woman and mother. At our last demonstration for peace, I saw terrible pictures - pictures of women with open slitted stomachs, old men missing the half of their faces, corpse without heads, reduced to vulgar meat-pieces a.s.o. An older french couple told me that they have lived in Jerusalem some years ago during 2 years. And the climate of daily life was already very bad : when they went to a restaurant with their Palestinian friends, they were insulted by Jewish inhabitants (this is only one example).  The Jewish soldiers you are speaking from are in their big, powerful tanks passing in small streets and destroy all they find on the way. I hate all kind of violence and terrorism and cannot agree in it. But one cannot treat a whole people as terrorists. They must be very desperated and hopeless if they send their children to death as human bombs. All those girls and boys who will never know what life is. No Avi, you are wrong : I don't hate the Jews and I know that a lot of them don't agree in what happens in this moment and that they organize demonstrations against. And if there are Palestinian mothers who are crying for their children, there are Jewish mothers too. Wars and fights are always a very, very dirty affair and bring desaster and tears over such a lot of innocents. This cruel, but beautiful world is big enough to permit to all the peoples, nations and religions to live together in peace and freedom.

<b>re: Karin Ramon's horrible comments
Firstly Karin, we can agree/disagree with everything happening in Israel/Palestine. It has nothing to do with Nazi-Germany. About 20 million people died in the Holocaust (not just Jews) in cold-blooded murder, not excess force.
Here in the Middle East, there is plenty happening. It is easy to find fault in the one side, if I only go to the meetings and only listen to the speakers that tell me what that side is doing.
Plenty Jews have suffered here too from Palestinian terror. The suicide bombers are just the tip of the iceberg. Thousands of Jews were killed here before the State of Israel was even established. I agree soldiers here have violated rights. What about the soldiers here who are fighting against war machines designed to kill innocent people in clear blood.
When Palestinians die in the Wesbank, here in Tel-Aviv, there thousands of Jews protesting and showing outrage for the Palestinian death. What happens when Jews die from suicide bombers? I don't see any huge Palestinian outrage anywhere. I do see thousands rejoicing and celebrating.
Here I hear sermonds from Mosques calling Jews "pieces of worms" and other curses.
Karin, I am not asking you to feel sorry for Jews because of the Holocaust. That happend 50 years ago and as bad as it was, it was by only a few people, the Nazis, not the Germans. 
I would however like you to show some sympathy to Jewish suffering in the Middle East too. Of the Jews I have met here, I have never met one who has not lost a brother/sister/parent/child as a result of bombs/cross-border attacks to Israel/suicide bombs etc.
If losing a child is not human suffering, I am not sure what is.
Karin, just because I have suffered terribly here, does not mean I should not feel sorry for Palestinian suffering. They suffered too.
I just find your callous hateful approach does not help promote peace for anyone.

<b>Je pensais qu'hitler avait ete au bout de l'horreur. je pensais que l'attentat contre le WTC avait repousse les frontieres de l'horreur. (je ne suis pas encore convaincu que Ben Laden en soit l'auteur). Jamais je n'aurai pu imaginer que les juifs puissent aller encore plus loin dans l'horreur de notre humanite. Car il est clair que depuis 1948, les juifs veulent toute la Palestine et creer un grand camp de concentration. Mais la, ils on repousse les frontieres de l'impensable, de l'inimaginable. Ils veulent, sous le couvert des USA et de leur chien de garde anglais exterminer tout un peuple, toute une culture. Je ne peux m'empecher de pleurer en constatant qu'en l'an 2002, il y ait des monstres pires qu'hitler, capables de detruire la vie froidement, d'enfants, de femmes, d'hommes.

<b>I am French, born in Germany. Born after the last war and so I never felt really guilty for what Hitler did to the jewish people. But I had nevertheless a feeling of sympathy and pity. Now it's finished ! How a people who had suffered so much can act in this terrible way against  another people !?! Until this day, the Jewish are always asking for pity and above all for money to repare what happened to them - and 60 years after, the third generation of Germans is still paying. Now, one knows where the money goes - it serves for arms to kill and disturb... In hoping that the European countries will finally stop following the orders of Bush and Sharon and have a reaction to save the Palestinian people, I send my very sincere feelings to the whole Palestinian population.

<b>Repeatable Scientific Ethics Democracy Productivity Formula Pollution Solution Scientific Laws in Human Development. 
Developing Skills in Productive Fields of Interest. 
Do you give positive attention while one is being good? According to Doctor Fitzhough Dodson some learned the only way to receive attention was through inappropriate behavior. As long as one was good one may have been ignored. Some who ignored others when they were good may have felt compelled to give instant focused attention for inappropriate behavior. Misbehavior was therefore attention. Misbehavior became a social life. The person thought the behavior was who they were. Others believed the behavior was who the person was also. The behavior received attention from some in the environment and allied forces producing further teasing for social recognition. While wasting productive time other needs failed to be met causing the need to feed off productive forces. Changing who one became depends upon the process. In the past some thought dictated undesirableness would stop unwanted actions. Authoritarians did not know punishment, which is a behavior recognizer, fools by temporarily suppressing behavior while at the same time giving social and self-recognition causing the behavior to repeat. Punishment must be given and received. Punished behavior repeats acquiring neither goodness or obedience. Recognizing the difference between the behavior and the individual do give the individual attention. Doctor Dodson suggests distracting and redirecting the individual to fun learning activities that lead to productive behavior while applying Extinction Technique by giving zero attention to behaviors one does not wish to be repeated. Recognized productive behavior becomes repeated productive behavior. Generative productive personalities develop. Children's productive behavior is the right to have their educational needs met and be actively engaged in the educational process. Scientific studies by recorded observation of behavior under precise behavior recognition conditions produced the results: Recognized behavior repeats, or to quote the results, "Recognized behavior is repeated behavior." as stated in How to Parent, the beginning of the book saying it is written to mothers, by Doctor Fitzhough Dodson which I read July 1974 and applied. Dr. Dodson also wrote How to Grandparent and How to Father. These scientific facts may not have been available to others and you before so forgive others and yourself for the unchangeable past punishment can not change and focus upon life's qualities being specific and investigative. Make a future. Quoting a homes and gardens magazine, "The best way to quit a bad habit is to substitute it with a good habit." 
Providing fun safe multiple-choice learning experiences for expression in individuality in an environment, which is safe to function within, develops interest in learning while continual watching and providing for interests extends and expands learning. Extended expanded play learning is Emergent Curriculum in the Early Childhood Education Field. During play children learn to use symbols, written sign verbal pictorial musical constructive language, to communicate. The book One Hundred Languages of Children by Carolyn Edwards is the story of Italy's child development Reggio Emilia Schools. Learning projects at Reggio Emilia are self-discovery projects. The children are free to think through how to construct and measure in their own way. During play the children test their theories. Chapter nine is the true story of a small group of children who draw a life scale dinosaur. The children found a place in the schoolyard large enough to draw a dinosaur. The school provided for the children's access many measuring sticks, "Rods", for laying side by side showing the precise height and length of the dinosaur. The school spared no rods. The children learned measuring skills used in building societies. The King's foot measurement divided into one dozen makes twelve inches. Cubit rods measure cubits. During projects the teachers engage the children in conversation. Children are inspired to inquisitiveness as a result of the teacher's provocative questions. Projects are displayed at community gatherings giving each child a sense of community. Community observers give recognition of correct principles applied to create each project. Rods used in child education to show quantities are Quizenairy Rods. Each uniform section on the rod is displayed by color. Each consecutive rod is one unit longer. Rods make useful levers. Rods reach under and pull out items a person can not reach. A walking stick is a sturdy rod. Children attain higher principles. 
Two principles of early childhood education are each classroom has three times as many positive free choice learning activities as the number of children and children are free to ask for their needs. Parent participation preschool in my neighborhood had free choice parent directed learning centers with one parent center for every five children. One parent participated one day a week for each child. Increasing good human development bonds neighborhood families and peers and efficiently creates a four day labor week and one family and community day. Quoting Doctor Fitzhough Dodson, "What is the ultimate goal we are working toward in the training of our children? If we reflect deeply on this question, most of us would say that our ultimate goal is to produce an adult who has learned self-regulation, who has learned to exercise his freedom in a responsible way." "A baby's wants are a baby's needs." "A mother is a baby's first social life." "The learner must be in condition to learn." "Give your child a positive model of what he should do." Mother and Father set an example as learning discovery information gatherers. Family members share learning experiences providing all education attention. A baby wants a social skill development learning day. Infancy is the optimum time to learn social skills thus developing social infants. Social infants tend to have their needs met according to scientific studies by recorded observation. People respond to social infants. (The Developing Person by Kathleen Stassen Berger) 
Doctor Fitzhough Dodson believes basic honesty is learned through the appropriate meeting of honest needs when one is honestly sleepy and honestly hungry. Messages by the blood stream requesting energy are honest biological messages. Baby's respect for personal property is gained by experiencing having personal property others respect. Children who see material thing meeting people's needs connect material things with meeting needs. My coat meets my needs and your coat meets your needs. Children who have their needs met are not busy doing that which is undesirable. Providing places for children to place their needs assures children their material needs are ready and waiting for them when needed. Baby sees others meeting needs and matures into the desire to meet needs also. Respect includes the owner's personal power over decisions to share including consideration and respect to the givers of gifts. When the choice is theirs to make children enjoy sharing. All children need their needs met at all times. (We do also.) My self-regulating infants slept when their bodies needed sleep. Since my infants had interesting active days they slept well at night. During the day they were free to nap. Toddlers wake up hungry for Break/Fast after early A.M. sleeping. Meals and snacks follow naturally. Studies show when a healthy variety of foods are placed upon the table in serving bowls family style children always choose a balanced diet. There are so many healthy choices in the variety of all good foods no one need ever take what one does not like. By choice I have developed a taste for sauerkraut. By experience sauerkraut was a food I had never heard of until junior high. My daughter in her highchair while I was feeding her Campbell's Vegetable Beef Soup ejected every pea. In two months she was eating peas with pleasure. Is it possible she was eating peas with pleasure because I did not force her to eat them? 
Since I could only clean wherever I was at wherever I was at was clean. Stepping out of bed the covers went up, dressing one item in the bath was cleaned, walking down the hall the beds were made, and rising up from breakfast the dishes were washed and kitchen cleaned. After relaxing in the afternoon the floors were done. The work was always already done. When I spent my time with the children the house stayed clean. We were actively involved in fun discovery and skill building. Education by experience was direct attentive communication by personal attention or wonderful education filled classroom lectures like circle time and college classes, sing along language skill development, learning projects, free choice positive learning experiences, reading good books, and playground social skills development health education. Reggio Emilia's idea of education also includes community and family social dining. Living the Scientific Laws of Human Development meant we could dine with the results of royalty having our typical lunch experience. I reply, "In 'government for the people, by the people, and of the people' everyone is royalty." Art and spatial relationships classes at college taught me principles of construction, space, design, and perception for skills in creativity. All these principles are repeatable science. The classes are fun. I loved my college classes and believe college has great value. While holding my small baby in my arms I thought of his future. I decided to give him opportunities to learn how to think by enriching his young life with daily valuable opportunities for learning. Personal knowledge would qualify him to choose how to care for people and the earth. Intelligence is applying one's profession to meeting the needs of the people. Raising him filled with the intelligence to know how to choose to apply professional services to serve others the best was my goal. Family fusion, productive energy resulting from family unity, bonds families. Extinct family fission, energy released as a result of family division. People experiencing having their needs met because families are united gains support for united families. 
Education is the power to direct one's own life. Self-regulating productive play educated persons develop into productive citizens. The process of meeting needs, which used to be called work, is now Playing Productively. Self-Governing peoples form a democracy. Democracy Occurs. World Democracy is National Defense. Peaceful nations is National Defense. National defense is Peaceful World Democracy. United Democracy organizations win defense contracts. Deduct national defense from your taxes. We have inherited the great gift of freedom and liberty. Preservation of freedom and liberty assures our future and the future of all. We are the light of Democracy before the world. 
Good human development brings freedom and liberty. Wrong human development is loss of liberty. One survival cure used in the past in distant places for rebellious reaction to being told what not to do was living in silence. One may feel rejected when one does not know they are in an environment where silence is being practiced. Whether silence is a cure or just preferred now that I know when others prefer silence because their personal selection of quality living is in the reading material they have chosen to add value to the moment I can join them with adding quality to the moment with my own chosen selection of valuable written material. When the mind is filled others enjoy words of value. People travel great distances to listen to learned people talk. Clean living peoples enhance our earth's vitality restoring and nurturing a clean planet. Homes where good human development develops clean living citizens whose behavior does not need restricting by high energy prices bring progress toward alternative energy. Workers in oil producing nations are learning skills to advance their nation into higher skilled higher paid services. Citizen's playing productively needs will be met. Good behavior raises the market. The market out competes gas and oil for a profit. Here is the way. The work is ahead. Please keep market coolness and profit take. Please prevent jumping the market causing an investor to interfere with work and mail to buy in low for the next ride up. Scientific advancements in Human Development raise the market every day. There are many stock markets in the world. Good human development develops self-controlled functioning upon knowledge. Wrong human development is exterior dictating resulting in the need for exterior support. To make a living on wrong human development there must be a drawing a circle around a person of exterior controlled what not to dos. The wrong human developers expect enforcers to be paid enforcing what not to dos. The person with the circle of what not to dos drawn around them becomes a slave of doing what not to dos for attention. Everyone becomes a slave to support what not to dos. For those trapped in outdated professions while crying for the world to continue earning a living on wrong human development they or others sometimes convince people good human development and wrong human development are reversed. One solution is new careers in helping office, field, and home-based professions adapt to people's true needs. A word of wisdom, "Avoid the appearance of evil." since punish-mental persons seeing opportunities of evil may believe someone needs controlling. A point on top of the ear indicated holding onto the top of the ear behavior management but they grew up to be men with a great deal of power. 
In the story of Brer Bear, and Brer Fox, and Brer Rabbit, Brer Rabbit was stuck in the tar baby. Brer Bear and Brer Fox were thinking of what to do with Brer Rabbit since they had made the tar baby to catch Brer Rabbit. Brer Rabbit said, "Please, don't throw me in the briar patch." Brer Bear and Brer Fox threw Brer Rabbit in the briar patch. Brer Rabbit jumped up and down and said, "I told you not to throw me in the briar patch. The Briar Patch is my home." A caught con wants the protection of thick walls where all his needs are met for the length of time society will be angry. Where does a con not want you to throw him? Society wants to be free from the con not knowing how to meet his needs appropriately. Everyone is happy so the process is not punishment other than being with everyone else society is angry at however a con is in joint company while innocent persons are not but does it develop people into meeting needs appropriately? 
Good behavior develops mentally and physically healthy people. Doctors and nurses earn a living being leaders in mental and physical health and curing those who profit by wrong human development and communism since what they made a living on is outdated prehuman development. Your health, not your unhealth, will be rewarding to the Doctor and nurse. The Doctor and nurse need you as well as you needing them so once you are healthy do remember the entire medical profession and all supporting fields still need to make a living. It is your turn to make them feel loved. Freeing people from past captivities is worthy employment. Hiring a lawyer with success in accomplishing right gives co-security for the right since you have the right to offer the lawyer while the other might have the wrong to offer. Lawyers help the balance in society of rebelliousness counteracting obeying a dictator the amount of rebelliousness in society being equal to the amount of dictating. Being caught in the trap is not necessary for those who do not practice dictating or being dictated unto. Many successful companies have their own insurance department. Intelligence adds value to the environment and the economy. Developed productive persons may be taught through fables defense against obedient enslavement to exterior commands and orders by punished no-self-control requesting the exterior control they were raised upon manipulators and their motives to gain go power by feeding untruth for others to function upon believing others are wrong to be so naive. Wrongdoing does not feed itself. If something needs exterior support is there wrong doing which must be feed by exterior support? Exterior support causes pollution. Productivity is fun. People who tell you what not to do may be rebellious themselves and while you are not picking up your baby and holding your baby their not picking up their baby and holding their baby is imagination. I listened to my baby and let such advice sail off in the wind. With the help of carriers and snuggles holders my baby was always with me. My baby was so positively directed active holding him became treasured moments. Clean safe places for the crawler to explore while being carefully watched develops the brain and body. Goal focusing keeps Toddlers going in a positive direction. Climbing is a toddler stage that can be easily provided for by many happy moments of climbing up and sliding down. Children's physical activity educates the brain in how fast the body is growing helping develop coordination the brain appreciating the goodness physical activity gives to the body. The arms growing longer than the brain knows results in a glass of milk being pushed over before the hand can clasp the glass. Cups with handles are useful during growth spurts. Raising the level of average is how to get ahead without leaving others behind. The best human developers served in many lands accomplishing goal oriented human development around the world. Human development knowledge is catching up with world progress. We know behavior that supports life. 
The Land of Milk and Honey (Bible) which is now desert with intelligent planning again returns to Lands of Milk and Honey. Shawna my American River Biology Teacher said, "Deserts repel rain, and trees and plants attract rain." Deserts, I believe are not natural earth habitats but man made literal ruins from ancient civilizations. Where deserts are today were man's natural places upon the earth were man fit into the ecosystem. Planting one tree in the middle will not turn deserts back into Milk and Honey Lands but Suburban and Urban Forests (Magazine Urban Forests) begin around the rim and grow inward. Soil is a mixture of sand, clay, and humus. Many deserts already have the sand. Lizards make good pets and adapt to nature centers. Ground burrowers aerate and fertilize soil, and build underground rivers allowing rainwater to absorb rather than striking the top of hard unpenetrable ground carrying off topsoil. Quality feeding ground burrowers is a valuable contribution to nature. Before deserts repelled moisture causing it to rain on Noah's mountain and flood down into the valley mists watered the earth at night. Melting snow mist crystals flow into streams. Man has advanced his knowledge of caring for the earth. More permanent roads may not be needed since we will be free to have alternative air transport, most populations live along waterways, and home life will be enjoyable and productive. My high school Biology teacher taught our class about wind factors. When one is driving 55 miles an hour in still air a 55 mile an hour wind is blowing on the front of the car. Capturing the wind in wind tunnels containing many small whirling pinwheels keeps electricity going to the battery of an electric car, boat, or airplane. Extending the length of the vehicle the wind tunnels leave clean air in back. My children being positively directed I was never afraid of their being perpetual motion. Being free to move as a result of their good behavior they enjoyed still activities. 
Science is all known measurable or related truths and newly revealed truths in the search for truth. The eighth edition of Science and Technology McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia defines science as, "The study of nature and natural phenomena." Scientists categorize truth and those categories are called sciences. The first sentence of many books is "This is the science of . . ." The rule of science is, "All science is Repeatable." For newly discovered results to be presented as science to the scientific community a scientist must establish a written formula with written step just like a construction plan producing the same results every time just like a construction plan. Scientists have taken all possible combinations of chemical reactions and discovered life does not come from non-life by chemical reactions therefore we do know it is not possible to begin life by any combination of chemical reactions. Scientists can write a formula with all possible combinations of chemical reaction and the results. The formula will always obtain repeatable results of the combination of all possible chemical reactions. Those results are science. Scientists can write a formula with repeatable results that sustain life. We are the receivers of all accumulated knowledge throughout history of how to sustain life. Knowledge keeps developing. We do know time is infinite. Time always was. Was there time without life? Life always was. Life forms complement each other. If your house is clean you are the life form in the house. If your house needs cleaning nature will add life forms such as ants. If your yard is clean you are the life form in the yard. If your yard needs cleaning nature will add life forms such as flies. If you are clean and flies come to your picnic they are just the neighbor's yard cleaners. An old American Indian proverb is life is growing short if one sees an owl face to face. Owls feed on mice cleaners. If the environment supports survival of long winged owls long winged owls will be surviving parents for the next generation. The earth is our home. Maintaining our home and our life is our responsibility. Man keeps advancing his knowledge of how to sustain life. I am greatful to all my ancestors for developing the science of sustaining life. The whole natural foods of the earth complement the needs of our body. Scientists use tools called theories in their search for truth. A theory is the question, "Could this be true?" Theories are questions used in the search for answers. 
For bad guys going good protection from old associates still expecting bad guy cooperation may be acquired in the future by teamwork in going good annonymous. All a guy needs to say to his old associates is he is a member of going good anonymous and he is free of expectations of being bad and free to be good for a living. 
Families are the soil where people are developed into good students. Addressing the subject of obedience, what are a two year old's communication skills? Doctor Dodson says "A two year old may not be able to obey the same as a six year old.", and if one is taught the only reason one does or does not do something is because someone says they might not know the other reasons and when the someone who says to or not to is not able to control there is no other reason. Inability to reason results. Inability to reason is the cause of low class. Forced obedience causes rebellion. Forced obedience and rebellion are connected not forces obedience and goodness. Rebellious may accuse any goodness as being the result of obedience. Productivity is power. Power used to support meeting needs is desirable. Power used to tell someone what to do or not do causes lack of ability to reason resulting in inability to survive without exterior support. Inability to reason is given less power in society by giving one whole class the same assignment and grading each child on how well they completed the assignment causing a division between the classes to determine professions. With less power to tell people what to do or not to do what crossing over their circle of what not to dos deceptive ways are used to gain power to tell people what to do or not to do? How many people do they want power over? The records switching project where the records of the good students were switched with the records of the poor students to see how the teachers grade the following years will be used to learn from to apply objective grading rather than fission families. I was one of those students my report card for the three quarters of the school year after Marysville flooded being filled in with undesirable marks while I was unable to attend school the Yuba City school and schools in the area taking in all the children they could but my birthday being at the end of the year I was low priority. I received an A in Behavior Observations and know how to write objective reports. To tell others what to do or not to do may not be effective. Engaging children in quality activities is effective. If we are effective with some but not all people will start wondering about a division in the classes and may do the equivalent of a record switch. Providing education to meet the needs of each student makes education fulfilling rather than giving one whole class the same assignment and grading each child on how well they completed the assignment in order to create a division between the classes to determine professions but also creating a division that keeps growing wider. A positive self-concept is everyone's need. Doctors and nurses no longer need to nurse the long line of failure causing a division between the classes used to lower into a life of mindless work. Solutions for the future do not include upside downing history in order to reverse the continually wider division between the classes. Black hats are switched with white hats their qualifications being what they know about while sometimes testing how much authority can get away with and mental health workers thinking they already know everything anyway using their power to cheat their way through college. Some who want to elevate themselves out of menial labor obtain money to pay menial labor with profits on physical repair. Who did it for money and power? Warning of danger becomes controlling by danger. In the information era the average productive intelligence will be greater than the greatest in history. Educated people are personally qualified to determine how to earn a living meeting people's needs having their own needs and the needs of their family met in return. Our Stewards are our greatest asset in a world changing from being prepared for failure to being prepared for success in human development. Looking at the labor force as a whole with all workers contributing to the needed labor helps show wages increase in all fields for everyone who accomplishes professional adaptation, thus contributing to the economy. The future is a new place. Faith has developed into knowledge and keeps advancing into knowledge of the laws of physics, society development, logic, and reasoning so one can appear to break the laws of physics while actually functioning upon them. Erik Erickson famous child psychologist said at the age of eighty, "Play your whole life." Children playing made America Great. 
The Bible defines the adversary as "the great accuser" or as my mother said, "What they say is what they are." which is the only thing they can make a living on. Accusers slander to capture productive energy. Some family members of profiteers who get their needs met by wrong doing gain wealth by sturring up trouble. Those who cry about being abused are accused of reacting which may cause someone to harm back who makes a living on what they are which is fine to them but undesirable to others because their profit system is different which they prefer. If one tells them what you are paying them so much money for will they make sure of it? The goal is developing what they are and say into earning a living. May you be productive and free. Productive Self-Governing Citizens is the goal. But the fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Gentleness, Self-Control, against such there is no law. From verse 22 of 5th Galatians. We need to develop a science of how to develop into productivity influences such as ones who plan to make a secure continual living on wrong human development and gain business by giving bad advice. I work with providers who elevate by educating and providing quality living. Hoping this information brings freedom. While researching I asked a man, "If someone hit you would you work?" He said, "Of course No." Someone who was trying to run people's lives on the basis of his thinking which was invalid reasoning said he has been doing so with everyone else's life before mine which could explain the long recession. Choosing your own course and sticking with your own course lets people know you choose your path in behalf of others and the earth. 
Biological feedback equipment can detect body functions and transmit discomfort causing one to buy relief eliminating brains putting dictators in power. All energy is convertible to useful energy. Redirect to honest earnings. Discourage stock in over the counter repair and profits from other repair also which may be used to cause further need of repair. Biofeedback equipment can also detect the professor's movements, steal the consciousness off the brains of the students, and lip read as it did during the draft. Not having studied a dictator's thinking has no educational foundation but is propaganda which violates the laws of logic, if-then-therefore, and the laws of reasoning, deductive and inductive, or is not supported by evidence. We need our national defense to support citizens earning an honest living. Combat does not prevent communism but is the cause as in China after the Boxer Rebellion and in Russia after loss of manpower after combat. America has been in a thirty year recession from which America is just coming out. The military need not feel it needs to develop people into needing to be controlled for military job security. Raphael said, "It is easy to get two people sitting next to each other fighting. Someone hits one over the back of the head. He thinks it is the other and hits the other over the head." The more one hits the other over the head the more one is hit over the back of the head because the one hit over the back of the head always thinks it is the other. Is fighting good for wrong human development profiteering businesses the business of war driving the whole world crazy for love of money and power? Others may win at their own game drawing big powers into the conflict on their side by making the other look in the wrong. Appearing as they really are is covered to a communist who can exterior support phony appearances of innocence and peace. Yes, Communists are wrong human development profiteers, profiting from people living on their own and others' wrong human development by living on support from others. However, reverse logic is not valid logic therefore not proving all wrong human development profiteers to be communist but still living on wrong human development profiteering. What portion of our taxes support wrong human development profiteering? If the China military earned a living on world unity the China military could support world unity. If the world militaries earned a living supporting world unity the world militaries could support the China military supporting world unity. Would a military government leader maintain power by sturring up trouble with other military forces in the world? Some military personnel have been using military power to cross over their circle of past exterior controlled what not to dos for the purpose of being supported to dictate. World wrong human development is world military dictatorship. Education is the foundation for governing, an educated citizenry being qualified to self-govern. Equipment used to bypass studying deletes qualifications to govern. One does not want one who did not study telling anyone what to do. Would military personnel gain job security, fame, and dictatorship by attacking the people while making another peoples look responsible? Does world trade decrease the business of war? Is an act of war good for the business of war? For military power and profits how easy is it to get people from the same country on airplanes? A new department of the reserves adapting military to civilian earnings needs military support by being rewarding. How was the radar over the Pentagon and on top of the world trade buildings functioning? The Doctors both physical and mental will have lots of work curing the elderly and military who profit by communism and profit by supporting the dictatorship side of a conflict as a result of people being attacked by one side of a conflict who makes the other side look like the attacker. Please contract the military to recognize and establish their own good behavior toward citizens of Democracy and developing Democracies though advancing world Democracy closes military bases. World good human development will put the military out of work. The military since their existence is the result of wrong human development may need positive directing by the government of self-governing peoples. We need to be managing the military and helping military personnel adapt. Emergency response has already been tried. Emergencies can be created. Peaceful border control needs to continue being in the hand of people who benefit from peace. Protection is developing others into meeting needs productively. Many meet their needs by pity and believe they are doing others a favor by meeting other's needs by pity also causing bawling for a living while coming between one and one's right to earn a living. What does, "Give'em the business." mean? National conflict changing heads of households from men to elderly will not be necessary. Communism thrives by giving bad advice. Elderly who experience their needs are met because families are divided may divide families to meet their needs. Thank you for protecting people from wrong human development advice for supporting militaries, for supporting wrong human development profiteers, for eliminating the competition for quality elderly care, and to fission families into service to them all. Does polluting eliminate the competition? Thank you for educating people out of being exterior controlled to prevent too overeducated to become slaves. Elderly care by the community means elderly receive care by the good human community development they have developed and are developing. In the past elderly may have learned to have their needs met in conditions of snowballing wrong human development while these conditions were not good for the rest of society. Is all abuse and terror good for wrong human development profiteering? Please redirect to Democracy Elderly Care. For continued quality elderly care society needs to be strong. Powers for exterior support will no longer count elderly as big power for dictatorship that is supported by the people's labors. Since the constitution places the people over the military not the military over the people as citizens we need to manage a military containing some air force personnel using military power and time to work in behalf of their God who they plan to come and tell everyone what to do with the help of the military the military attacking people's brains making limitations that people will loose their freedom to wrong human development profiteers helping tell people what to do also, some people being told to attack other people's brains that others can receive the same financial reward system by living on the people. Is it safe in the air? Biofeedback equipment used to steal the consciousness off people's brains leaves the population defenseless to a dictator's inability to reason. Having brains is the legal definition of life. No one wants to be a robot. For the inability to logic and reason to attempt to seduce others into joining them brains may have been attacked first. The night of the hits I dreamed one form with many faces said, "We proved we have the power to hit. Now you have to do whatever we say." If one lets them control the plane, where will it go? Since power is their goal doing what they say gives them power. Dictators have not studied. If they had they would know better. Do those who develop thieves expect to be exterior supported? Is the leader of thieves a thief? Was national defense stolen by thieves for their defense and applied to the power of thieves? When around the corner within walking distance the sermon after the attack was about how the terror attack was driving people to God and they hoped we did not need too many more of these things before people turned to God I knew the predator ate the shepherd and his wife the medical attendant was feeding on the flock abused bodies medical profiteers masterminding terror and war for a profit. The attack was holy terror dictatorship that needs to be exterior supported. Are they afraid to come out and work the only thing they can make a living on being to drive society crazy? Where was the sermon we went to hear? We need a law against dictatorship based upon violations of the laws of intelligent thought processes. Punish-mental persons setting others up to be accused my give dictators power over workers acquiring labor to support telling peoples what to and not to do. Telling people what to and not to do does not support itself. Men who are warriors may be supported instead of supporting leaving the work to the woman and others. Raphael said, "When white man came to America they found woman doing all the work and thought they could improve on a system like that." Intelligence is slandered when F grades are switched to A grades resulting in wrong thinking it is right and people saying intelligence is dangerous. The amount of punish-mental ness is equal to the amount of need for war profits. How is punish-mental ness used to fuel war? Have punish-mental people made punishment look like suicide in the past? Can punishment be made to look like suicide bombing? The F grade thinking it is right is a dictator needing to be controlled out of bossing people. Does people being harmed while going after a suspect embarrass some out of going after the real guilty party? At school one child punched another child in the tummy and then threw himself down kicking and screaming as if he was the one punched. Was I supposed to accuse the wrong person? A false prophet is one prophesying the results of their own punishing. A genius whose contribution is valuable to the world is exempt from the draft.

Prosperity spread through many lands during a time of great depression as a result of the people being taught the teachings of their three great prophets Abraham teaching one God, Moses teaching the ten commandments, and Jesus teaching the first and second great commandments "Thou salt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it. Thou salt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the laws of the prophets." by Mohammad who joined a camel caravan at the age of fourteen. How easy is it for the anti-Christ to get two peoples who believe in the teachings of Jesus fighting? 
Man are meadow makers when "The more edge the better around a meadow for the wildlife to go in and out of the forest safely to graze on grass the sunlight can reach." Rule changes rectangle clear cuts from ugly useless patches to useful functions within the forests providing meadows. Grazing causes Native American grasses to thrive. 
Professional Adaptation Education from being prepared for failure to being prepared for success in human development needed. One wrong human development major minored in adaptation to good human development. Hopefully in the future there will be a law requiring alternative sources of income for wrong human development profiteers. Professional adaptation causes less competition for people living on wrong human development. 
Wrong human development profiteers accusing and gaining prey by the legal process, sometimes holding court, and eating the results is cannibalism. Cannibals hate "self-righteous" people and accuse the other before being accused especially when having done something wrong. What does a cannibal call winning? What does friends and popularity mean to a cannibal? Would they choose a thief for their leader? Whose profit system is harming people? One person's complaint of being abused while the abuser was pointing a finger at her and calling her crazy received the response the abuser's family was in the mental health business and they could only make a living on what they were winning at what they were better than anyone else their considering her sanity a hard nut to crack. While they are inflicting people with their inability to reason, they are willing to be paid to give the cure to see things their way. The opening Pandora's box look of "Let them do anything they want?" excuse for punishing indicates lack of leadership, lack of supervision, lack of providing positive choices of things to be doing, lack of providing, lack of providing and being good companionship, and lack of education in enjoying the good things in life. Does an extended related family member of mental health profiteers joining a religion and making a phony marriage unwanted by the bride who was engaged when she did not want to be as a result of hearing herself say yes against her wishes to his, "This is your last chance. Will you marry me?" with a two night honeymoon of falling asleep watching him sit in an easy chair in a dark room with the light of the T.V. facing him reflect his shape preceding fainting regularly after having the flue for over a month to come to, to see him come through the room door bare-chested holding a plunger, that was alibied with darling artificially inseminated children acquired by standing on one's head while assuming for four years he came home at night not being able to wait up till midnight for another year his not being there when she awoke during the four years and deceiving the people into opening Pandora's box to control a person out of real marriage where she learned microscopic does not always mean not seen upon sight back into a phony marriage but really into twenty-four hour three hundred and sixty-five day a year live-in elderly care eliminate the competition for elderly care, Sunday the day of rest, in behalf of dictatorship? Communism and religion do not mix. Democracy elderly care is good for the people. Let's lead and provide. Discipline discipl(in)e , meaning disciple of, is being positively engaged in enriching activities. Mary the mother of Baby Jesus was artificially inseminated other babies of artificial insemination not being alone. 
The King's job was to protect his kingdom. Not being naive was a requirement for his job. A king had to know his sociology. The king had to see to all the needs of his people. Being king was not a job for complacency or dictating. If being king began to look like exterior support or dictating to people in his kingdom who he allowed hunger for exterior support and dictating, exterior supported dictatorship, he lost his job and his kingdom. Some Military personnel may be trapped by unconsciousness into the only way they can have their needs met. Rasputin may have been already needing exterior physical electrical processes support. If the Czar's relatives and Czararina Alexandria had scientific knowledge we have today they may have been able to give Rasputin life and protected by adjusting exterior enforcements thus permitting plus teaching others to meet their needs productively. We may all have our own Rasputins controlling by unconsciousness who can live without personal physical energy processes better than anyone else while living for attention and be working on solutions. The more exterior what not to dos they are given the more exterior support they need. Exterior what not to dos and exterior support are attention and can be mistaken for love. 
This script is sent to you without request for purse. Anyone asking for purse may be fueling wrong behavior. Raising the market may attract calls for pity rewards from wrong human development profiteers placing themselves in your hands the hands of professional adaptation rather than you in theirs for a living. Anyone calling saying they represent me, it is not true but representatives of the records switchers seeking financing for highly expensive constant moral physical financial and spiritual abuse to drive workers to live in elderly service. Warnings have turned to promises of physical abuse to support the medical profession living on taxes to support communism and to support people needing money to pay the medical profession by working for communists, slander and slave, being slandered and abused out of other work, and turned to spiritual dictating by suspected threat of abuse (supersition) to back-seat drive people's lives .

What can be done for the policeman who is mad at innocence because what will he do for money? Professional Adaptation Please. Protect your child from being turned into a wrong human development profiteer by wrong human development profiteers because your child is good.
Where there abused bodies medical profiteers in the Donner Party resulting in the Donner Party being trapped at Donner Summit? Please check the descendents of the Donner Party that settled below the snow line in California. How are they profitting?
The related extended family members of military psychiatrist Dr. Hamm and his former wife of Woodside Way Auburn California have given and plan to give me the business following me and evil spiriting harm. The related family members of their friend Mr. Cook are here too. Are they giving others the business also? Did they bring with them the person who was angry at people in eastern USA. Did the military follow me too? Did descendents of the Donner Party follow me by military transport? The military is over twenty percent of the nation's pollution. Early in the 1980's Susan Sweet said, "In 1984 the pigs will take over the world." I did not know what she meant. Did Susan cause the pigs to take over the world? The imposter may be a pig. No one will believe a military pilot formerly of closed Mather Air Force Base who is angry Democracy closed his base down and has abused me for the last ten years by military power because my profession is good human development which results in Democracy is the real Terrorist and succeeded in terror bringing in war profits to support him and his life style and others who live his life style but please prevent him from further acts of terror. I have been abused and if I am abused by him for his profits and others who join him for profits who else are they abusing military war games not needing to play both sides having real Democracy to play spiritual and physical war upon? Please disconnect power of the military over the labor force to reveal exterior supported phony appearances supporting exterior supported phony appearances. I have been followed by wrong human development profiteers. Please protect me and others from abuse and terror by war profiteers. Their acts of terror really did result in war. How much more terror to bring in war profits does he need? The military living on communism instead of being successful fighting communism, they will live on terror instead of being successful fighting terror giving the appearance of fighting terror to cause terror. Please protect the nations in the future from terror to stur up war thus causing loss of man power which causes communism which supports militaries. While walking past Dr. Hamm's house on my way to college when his second son walked up to me and said he had touched everyone and everything in a marital way and everyone else was to it also so would I do it with him I was naive to think people could stop him since they would not want him to touch them. I said I heard touching a frog gives warts. Please protect the earth. How many are sacrificed to the God of telling people what to do and what not to do, the God of inability to logic and reason? A wrong human development profiteer knowing the only reason he is nice is using invalid thought processes to accuse people who are nice to have the same motives. The inability to logic and reason may do unto others before others do unto them what is deserved playing life like a chess game making the first moves. The adversary accuses the Lord and ones who believe in doing right claiming all they have because of past destructions of ancient wrongdoers. Goodness in necessary to support people. Noah lived to be our gr-gr-gr-+ grandparent assuring the best parenting. 
I need a tee shirt that says, "If you are going to slander me, please slander me out of twenty-four hour three hundred and sixty-five day a year live-in elderly care where one becomes conscious to answer the door back into the rest of life where I will freely serve elderly gladly as before as my Scottish mother did." The send from Auto Complete Function on the public computer had my name in all lower case letters which I never do to names proving I have been slandered. I can not do all the elderly care in the world causing me to wonder how the rest of the needed elderly care is being acquired. Has the record switching project switched people into working of telling people what to or not to do? Who has been switched into teaching human development? If I do not do it, it does not get done, people who work having their own work to do, though others are switched into money for my work. Please pay no one. Education puts value in the dollar while telling people what to and not to do takes value out of the dollar. Feel free to write a rebuttal on communism the introduction to their book defining history as the rising and falling of powers that capture the forces of productivity. The forces of productivity are milked. Not playing productively, communists are boring. Demands may be cover by and for war profiteers who can say anything about who they are and what their motives are. Honest people know how to meet their needs appropriately. No matter what happens I will continue working for peace. Who is working for foreign relations? </b><br>

<b>i saw that alot of people feel sorry for palestinians. the world thinks Israel is the "bad guy" in this story. how come they don't see the terror we israelies live in. we are killed in our homes and our cities by cold blood murderers. how come the world forgotten Kemp David and Oslow. we were ready to make true peace. Ehud Barak took a great risk and was willing to go further from rational. but the palestinians leaders didn't want peace. they want war and death. this is their way of receiving popularity among their people. Arafat and his fellow murderers came from oslo, instead of putting money into to economic future investings, education, things that have future betterness for his people, he bought weapons and educated the youth to hatered and "Shaheedness". i say "HE DOESN'T WANT PEACE!!!! - HE WANTS ISRAEL DESTROYED". but the palestinians will never make their dreams happen. the world doesn't like jews and never did. the world either killed or didn't help 6 million jews. the jews can not trust the world. we are alone. the world doesn't see the truth, and never did. they want us destroyed same as the palestinians. i am very sad about this antisemitism that is now coming back to life so largely, but i just want the world and the palestinians to know that we are one of the strongest people in the history. nobody can destroy us. so many times before they tried but never suceeded. you especially can not, because you are weak and easy to manipulate. you have no morals, no mercy, you have a big legecy of lies and manipulation. and mostly: in battle the man who is willing to die but wants to live is alot stronger than the man who wants to die and doesn't care for life. we will win. you will get your independant state but instead of living in peace and prosperety beside us, you will live in poverty, suffering and unemployment in you own country with your corrupt leaders. you could have had great future but you messed it up and now i hate palestinians. a year and a half ago i didn't. you butchered us, i saw children dead. you did with the intention of killing with blood thurst. you're leaders and Hamas and Jihad, and all the rest are nothing but primitive, stupid animals. i pity them and i pity you, but i don't give a shit any more. and you antisemic Europeans, we don't need you. you are evil, full of hate as well. i will never visit you're countries. you should be ashamed of your self for not even trying to know the truth and choosing the easy way. believing what you are told. the same happened in World War 2 and the Hollacost.</b><br>

<b>I have no wise words to contribute, only comments from an American who has friends of Israeli ancestry and friends of Palestinian ancestry, and find myself caught in the middle.  Two beautiful cultures with good people and good intentions...so unfortunate that the extremists who look at the world through the eye of a needle seem to glean all of the power.
My husband is from Ireland, and I have seen first-hand what many of my American compatriots have never experienced; hatred rationalized by persons, families, communities, and finally NATIONS of people. I think it is very hard for many Americans to understand what the region in which you live is going through.  Only by personalizing your plight will you succeed in winning over more public outcry for what you are going through.  I think the email I recieved from a cousin in Ireland was the best insight I have seen yet that has not been tainted by what the American Press thinks we want or need to recieve.  You made an impression on me - and I will do what I can to further the cause of peace for your peoples.
I mourn for your losses in your families - both sides of the issues.  I truly believe that there is a way for you to live in peace together - but as I have no solution, I pray that the windows to The Great One that are opened by those who truly love Allah, The God of Isreal, and Christ will open the way to Peace for all of us.

<b>Peres must put alternatives to Sharon's policies 
Joseph Cooper 
In Liverpool yesterday, I joined a large number of people who marched from Mulgrave Street to the Pier Head to voice their anger at the present Israeli incursion in the West Bank and Gaza. 
My position, I wanted to protest at the treatment of journalists within the present conflict which has set a terrifying precedent and I am sure will have grave consequences for those who report on conflict around the world. 
These actions against journalists also take away hope for those suffering oppression for fair reporting of their plight and can only be regarded as a tactic of terror by those who impose “closed security areas” and dole out sanitised images to CNN and the BBC, with official army spokespersons addressing the camera in a more than media savvy manner in their battle fatigues. 
In recent days Operation Protective Wall has been protected itself by the shooting of journalists, the use of stun grenades and live rounds to force those who would report to the world, the conduct of engagement in this conflict, to stay out. It is apparent that there is a game being played and time has taken on a strange dimension. 
The US has called for IDF forces to pullout from Palestinian-ruled territory in the West Bank "now ... not tomorrow" this statement by President George Bush's national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, and echoed by Colin Powell totally ignored by Ariel Sharon and the Likud led right wing coalition in the Knesset. 
In fact one would be forgiven for thinking Israel had been given a week to mop up by the US, given that speaking of his trip to try and broker a cease fire, Colin Powell went on national television last night and stated that he doubted if he would return to the US with a deal. He will visit Morocco, Egypt and Spain before arriving in the region on Friday of this week. A certain lack of urgency and will to resolve the situation. 
Analysis of the Israeli-Palestinian position and recent statements from President Bush and Tony Blair brings into question the current position of Shimon Peres and the Israeli Labor Party. The time is surely right for MK Peres to leave the government and take up the leadership of the Israeli peace camp. 
Events in recent days have led to National Religious Party ministers, led by Effi Eitam a former Brigadier General, described in the Israeli press as an extreme hawk, being invited to join the government. Eitam is on record as stating that “Arab Israeli’s are a cancer” evidence enough of an even wilder swing to the extreme right in the Knesset. The NRP representatives will be joining the security cabinet and influencing governmental decisions. Yisrael Beitenu, with its hard-line positions, and Gesher, are also conducting talks about joining the government. 
This will mean that hard-line right wing figures such as Avigdor Lieberman, Benny Elon and David Levy will also possibly join the coalition.This will surely lead to a split in Israel. Between those who would favour possible peace and security within a framework that would mean no further settlements and a return to 1967 borders in compliance with UN resolutions and those who see the end game being played out with the integration of the Palestinian occupied territories into the state of Israel. Fulfilling the religious and ideological hard line Zionist project that calls for the occupation of the whole of Palestine. 
The time is right for the Israeli Labor Party to summon up the will and determination to seize the opportunity at hand. There is worldwide pressure on Israel to moderate and negotiate and the Labor party are the only faction capable of engaging in this process. After the extreme right joins the coalition, Labor's influence in the government will be virtually nil, especially whenever there is a vote in the Knesset.
The demarcation is clear, for Jews worldwide not only in Israel, must make their moral decision upon which camp they join. This the real dividing line between the peace camp and the right wing. This is how the state of Israel and Jewish individuals must align themselves and be counted. Opinion polls in Israel suggest that 60% of the population support current Israeli government policy 
A clear alternative to Sharon's policies should be outlined by the Labor Party, this can only happen if Labor leave the present government and present the foresight of an Israeli state that wants to live in security inside the 1967 borders. The future of Israel’s standing in the world community depends on the personal decision of every Jew on this key issue.

<b>Je ne sais de combien de cris avons nous besoin pour decider enfin d'itervenir?Existera t'elle une espèce sur terre qui peut supporter une soufrance comme celle supportée par notre peuple palestinien.
  Fréres de religion,fréres de sang ,croyez moi notre silence sur ce que vous étes entrain de subir est un suplice pour nous.A chaque jour notre degré de complicité s'accroit et nous fait aussi soufrir.
En tant que complice je vous felicite pour votre resistance,pour nous avoir tous rappeler qu'elle existe toujours sur terre une chôse qui s'appelait: courage honneur et dignté.
Continuez nous prions pour vous;vivants résistants ,martyrs priez pour nous avant de partir à votre paradis éternel

J'ai commencé à m'investir dans votre cause il y a plus d'une année en dénonçant les atrocités israëliennes dans divers sites internet. Mon opinion est très largement répandue dans la population suisse qui est écoeurée par les interventions israëliennes dans vos territoires.

<b>The Palestinian struggle for survival, peace, statehood and return of land is not forgotten in Australia. On Saturday a large rally took place in Sydney ending at the Isreali consulate. This was followed by a candlelight vigil outside the consulate on Tuesday this week. The Australian Greens (the only major political party that has clearly rejected Bush's global war of rerrorism) will hopefully shortly call publicly for Israel to get  out of the occupied territories.

<b>MON CHER AMI SHARRONE, 
Je ne sais pas s’il me faut t’appeler « Ami », moi qui n’ai ni père ni mère ! Et, tu serais le seul sur Terre à jouir de cette subtile et sublime affection ! Un mérite pour toi et un privilège pour moi ! Ton nom, mon digne fils, est la traduction du mien et va dans le même axe que celui de ce cher Bush Junior ! Noble famille s’il en est, sur votre planète damnée, les Bush ! Grâce à eux, les ventes d’armes se multiplient, les crédits d’armement augmentent et les perfections surpassent mes projets ! Exterminer devient une prophylaxie, une hygiène l’épuration est proche, la race pure vaincra ! 
Grâce à toi, sadique profanateur, mon semblable, mon frère, j’ai pu prospérer et faire malgré les émules  austères de vos ennemis,  des prosélytes enthousiastes ! Bien plus radicaux que ces obsolètes fanatiques et ces extrémistes, aux cagoules endeuillées ! Tu es le meilleur de mes compagnons de destinée, l’accro le plus fidèle, le mal sanctifié ! 
Je sais que tu liras ma lettre avant d’effacer du  globe ce peuple, ingrat ( qui ne t’a rien fait, en fait, ) et qui porte la guigne, avec prédestination et masochisme prémédité ! Honnis soient leurs ancêtres ! Le feu que tu rallumes, est une aurore pour mon règne ! Cet horizon m’emplit d’extase et me baigne dans le bonheur, au point que je regrette tous ceux qui sont passés à la tête des états et qui n’ont pu suivre le modèle de mon fils Hitler ! 
Je sais qu’on te traitera de malade, de fasciste, de sioniste, de raciste, de monstre, d’assassin, voire de criminel; or, c’est à ce prix que tu as pu glaner tes lauriers et mérité d’entrer dans ma famille ! Et, je suis si fier de toi ! Je sais qu’on te maudira, sûr que ça me va ! C’est ça le rite de passage, qui te sangtifira*, pour entrer dans mon clan ! Malgré les tabous de la démocratie qui t’a élu ministre, tu as devoir de nettoyer de la carte ce peuple archaïque ! Les mécréants n’ont nul droit aux libertés que tu respires,  ni aux terres que tu leur aspires, pas plus qu’ils n’ont compris que ce sont les paris de l’histoire qu’ils ont perdus et qui les ont  déshérités de leurs terres ! 
J’aime voir tes bataillons jaillir des rues et se ruer sur les foules d’enfants et de femmes. J’aime te voir faucher leurs voitures comme des fétus de paille, renverser les murs sur les réfugiés et les harceler même dans les églises ! J’aime te voir pulvériser leurs toits et leur affaisser dessus les murs. Je me réjouis de te voir ravager les champs, arracher les oliviers et me plait de regarder ta force s’exhiber dans la poudre ! Martial esthète, qu’il est merveilleux de sentir ta compilation de chairs et qu’ils sont magnifiques tes  tableaux de chasse, gavés d’asphalte et de sang ! Superbes, ces rangs de canaques refroidis, marchant nus en civil, pour servir de pare-chocs humains à la progressions des chars ! J’aime, par-dessus toutes les sombres litanies, les larmes et la poussière des clameurs confuses ! Echos vengeurs, je suis fasciné de te voir répliquer, par ces tirs musicaux, aux hurlements des indigènes ! Verse sur ces masses ahuries, l’encens de tes gaz, inonde-en leurs macabres processions et répand l’effarement et la panique sur le passages de leurs enterrements ! Riposte aux cris des « rats » et à leurs jets de pierres, par de beaux tirs, civilisés et de pieuses mitrailles ! Qu’ils sont beaux les tumulus de sables frais et de boues au sommet des fosses communes ! 
La musique savante, les éclats adroitement orchestrés entre les rafales qui pétillent et les obus qui explosent, déchaînent mes instincts et j’exulte, mon frère Sharrone ! Les chars qui rugissent au milieu des partitions des avions qui  sillonnent les nuages, écrivent de fantasques symboles où tinte la mitraille ! La musique est l’aliment des dieux, et je suis de ceux-là ! Les mélodies qui fusent dans le ciel et font briller de mille feux la nuit, sont les chefs d’œuvre de tes virtuoses et de la création ! Comme des jeux de lumière et d’amours fauves, les complaintes qu’ils jouent m’enchantent quand elles déchirent les anges et le Ciel ! J’adore le feu et les gaz qui flambent : ce sont les plus beaux des nuages ! Le parfum des chairs qui crépitent, l’odeur de poudre qui exhale ! 
Ah, Sharrone si tu pouvais m’offrir le plus grand méchoui de ce siècle : un met dont l’odeur nucléaire, ferait fondre les couches d’ozone et les arabes dans une étreinte de führer ! Et leurs âmes perdues, remonteraient jusqu’à moi, portées jusqu’aux étoiles, pour frétiller dans le frémissement de mes naseaux ! Ahhkhhh !
Mon cher fils, Ariel, 
Je t’ordonne en Fatwa ceci : Casse leurs symboles ! Humilie leurs rois, leurs chefs avec les recours de paix qu’ils colportent de l’Europe, devenue séditieuse, pour nous narguer, éradique leurs religieux ! Bafoue leurs idoles, culbute leurs mosquées et leurs tours, renverse leurs dômes et va jusqu’à Bethléem et Nazareth ! Expulse leurs évêques, leurs curés et leurs moines ! Le vieux Pape recourbé sur ses ans, ne dira rien qui puisse te froisser avec ses exordes latins ! Ses esthètes adorateurs d’Europe, occupés à s’élire, ne feront rien pour se nuire ni pour endiguer ta rancœur victorieuse ! Car ils sont affairés, affalés sur leurs affaires, inondés dans leur mea culpa, depuis l’Holocauste des Juifs, en Allemagne !
Exile leur chef, Arafat qui te défie par sa  tremblante volonté, de vouloir mourir en martyr ! Abou Amar, aura été touché par la grâce chrétienne et contaminé par son épouse ! Tu ne vas pas faire l’erreur de le laisser suivre, en Jésus dans sa candeur, ni être apitoyé par ton ennemi récalcitrant ? Ils osent se dire résistants ces canailles colonisées ! C’est lui le grand manitou, le sorcier retors des terroristes, des rebelles, des bombimen* et de filles kamikazes ! Empêche les chefs européens de lui téléphoner et de le rencontrer dans l’isolement où tu l’as mis avant l’égorgement total  ! Casse leurs chefs, torpille leurs maisons et fait renaître des cendres le Peuple Elu, des cendres des fripouilles! Exile-les chez leurs odieux frères sémites ? Ils ont pleins d’états pour les recueillir ! Empêche-les de remettre leurs pieds calleux et suants sur ces terres prophétiques ! ‘’ One way ticket ‘’ for Arafat ! Tu l’as dit, sans rigoler et j’ai pouffé de rire en pensant à la chanson ! Sacrée Sharogne, tu es le meilleur du Peuple Elu ! 
Silence, on tourne ! Sus aux journalistes ! Détruis les « chiens », les radios et les télés ! Démoli leurs écoles, démantèle leurs camps, rase leurs hôpitaux, sans pitié ! Ravage les rues et fait les vomir leur asphalte et leurs cailloux ! Détruit leurs prisons, sans reculer, efface-les, avant de faire face aux interventions et aux suppliques étrangères ! Froidement empêche-les d’enterrer leur pourriture ! Qu’ils les jettent dans des fosses communes ! Affame les récalcitrants, coupe les vivres et surtout les médicament ! Mieux vaut prévenir que soigner, tire sur les médecins et les ambulances, il y a des terroristes réfugiés dedans ! Fait piller les magasins, fait éclater les conduites d’eau, coupe leur le phone et l’électricité ! S’il fait froid et s’ils en meurent, c’est tant mieux ! Empêche-les de se voir et de se parler, interdit-leur d’alerter les nations et les médias,  surtout ! Anéantis les aéroports, pour empêcher les missions de venir t’importuner et la Croix Rouge de leur apporter remèdes, jusqu’à les éradiquer ! Réduit à néant leurs garnisons et tire sur les prisonniers ! A la guerre comme, à Sabra et Chatila, tu as la recette finale, sabre-les et châtie-les !
Neutralise, pour anéantir ! Vise bien les tempes, et entoure tes chars de civils pour éviter les ripostes ! Installe tes snipers dans chaque angle et recoin. Ils sont crédules et naïfs, leur chasse en sera aisée et fertile ! Offre aux réfugiés dans les maisons, aux assoiffés, à ceux que tu affames, comme à ceux qui ne peuvent enterrer leurs parents morts, de sortir sans crainte ! Mais, cueille-les, par surprise, la guerre est faite de trahisons et de leurres ! Tu es un maître en la matière ! N’hésite pas à laisser tirer dans le dos ceux qui se sauvent, les lâches ! Les enfants qui balbutient la peur, les fillettes qui rampent, les vieilles édentées et les vieillards malveillants, sus aux handicapés, ce sont des fanatiques qui te trompent ! Dis à tes milliers de soldats, aux vingt milles appelés, aux milices extrémiste aux colons, de viser les tempes ! 
Tirez bien les balles, près de l’oreille : le son en sera amplifié et la terreur tuera avant la mort ! Je le sais d’expérience ! Que les crânes sont beaux quand ils éclatent et essorent les cervelles vides au travers de leurs orifices ! Quel plaisir de leur faire craquer les côtes et de les réduire en cendres ! Régale-toi Sharonne et partage mes joies ! Chaque tête que vous cueillez vous démontre l’absence d’intelligence chez votre ennemi héréditaire et l’absence d’âme dans leurs crânes ! 
Ils veulent leur indépendance, tien, et leur terre et la liberté, en sus ! La paix, disent-ils, contre la reconnaissance et les terres ! Quand on est puissant et riche, Sharonne mon frère,  on n’a pas besoin de la reconnaissance des faibles ! Ils sont naïfs et ne méritent pas de se multiplier comme du bétail sur Vos terres ! Inutile, Sharrone de les laisser végéter, ils sont impropres à vivre, sauf pour être immolés ! Allez-vous demain, libérer, par humanité, votre cheptel et rendre leur indépendance à  vos vaches idiotes et vos moutons boiteux ? Eloigne-toi des sensibleries indignes, des Chefs Européens et de leurs représentants Parlementaires ! Ce sont des gêneurs, des curieux, qui s’ingèrent dans tes affaires ! Tu n’es pas l’Afrique ! Tu risques des faiblesses morales, qui fragiliseront ta force et ton caractère ! Enseigne aux tiens la rigueur, face aux ennemis et réprime tous ceux qui s’en approchent ! Ils risquent de les contaminer avec des notions désuètes de commisération et de les moraliser selon leurs préceptes dérisoires de respect des droits de l’homme ! Encore faut-il être homme pour cela ! 
Tuez même les gosses de la vermine prolifique, offrande pure, jouant avec des cailloux ! Tue-les avant qu’ils n’éclatent sur la face de nos chérubins ! N’est-ce pas Mon Général ! Qu’ils se noient dans la haine que tu multiplies chez eux, qu’ils crèvent dans la faim qui les enserre et qu’ils se morfondent dans la honte et la misère ! Qu’ils goûtent à la rancune et fassent leur exode, en attendant que tu prépares pour eux l’holocauste purificateur et la crémation après la nouvelle guerre des religions, que tu as allumé hier ! Il est dépassé le temps de tuer à la pièce et de décimer : il faut industrialiser leur anéantissement final et l’optimiser ! Rassure les tiens et ceux de ta Nation qui habitent hors d’Israël ! Après nettoyage de leurs villes des ethnies brunes et les purifications religieuses, militaires, nationalistes et salvatrices de la région, toutes ses richesses vous appartiendront ! Et vous pourrez allumer tout le pétrole que vous voulez et fêter la victoire attendue  de votre Nation !
Je reviendrais alors, je reviendrais combattre les Légions des Cavaliers de l’Apocalypses et préparer avec toi et tes frères, votre règne dans l’Eden  sur Terre ! Le Paradis promis vous reviendra par la grâce de votre Maître Saigneur* ! Votre rétribution seront les richesses accumulées d’Orient, votre supériorité sur les peuples qui vous ont exploité, les états qui vous ont humiliés et haïs, l’Egypte où vous étiez esclaves, vous sera rendue !  Fais la purge, Sharonne, avant le Purgatoire ! J’arrive !
Ton frère qui t’aime, t’approuve et t’admire : 
             SATAN   BELZEBUTH     !

<b>Israel's terrorism on the nation of Palestine is most horrible &amp; inhuman. Such acts of terror on civilians and on a nation should not only be CONDEMMED by the world, but the world needs to take action to root out such violence on Palestine. How long are we to be puppets of the U.S.? If today, the U.S. did not back up Israel, Israel would simply crumble to dust, and lose it's power,as they are so evidently backed by the U.S.  
We pray for you and your country, pray for peace, pray for justice to be restored to this immoral world, pray to God to open the eyes of the world to realise &amp; root our such violence against humanity.
Sharon says they are "rooting out the terrorist infra-structure of palestine". If Palestinians giving their life for their country (they are only freedom fighters without weapons) is called terrorism, Sharon must be the right hand of Satan. 
It is time the whole Arab world united, and took action against Israel.

Many people are calling the embassy daily, and also our own government to speak out about these inhumanities.
You are not alone.  You are in the hearts of many across the world.  We will keep up the pressure from this end.  Be strong and courageous.

LIEGE, BELGIUM - Tuesday, April 09, 2002 at 10:54:17 (IDT)<hr>
<b>Bonjour,
J'ai reçu votre message ce matin, transféré par mon frère, et l'ai aussitôt transféré à tous ceux que je connais...
Il y a 60 ans, la télé n'existait pas et le monde ne savait pas ce qui se passait à leurs frontières... Ce qui s'est passé alors a été une abomination contre l'humanité toute entière...
A cette époque-là aussi, en France, nos grands-parents, nos oncles, nos pères étaient les terroristes des allemands et de suite après la guerre, ils ont été encencés par ceux qui les ont libérés...
Aujourd'hui, nous disposons de tout un dispositif d'information pour savoir, à la minute près, ce qui se passe dans le monde et surtout en ce moment, en Palestine...
Aujourd'hui, les palestiniens sont les terroristes des israeliens et tout le monde les laisse tomber...
Pourquoi tant de haine ? Les israeliens auraient-ils la mémoire courte ?...
M. Sharon a-t-il eu de la famille déportée, torturée, assassinée dans les camps de concentration pendant la 2è guerre mondiale ? A croire que non... A croire que tous les israeliens qu'on nous montre tous les soirs à la télé ont oublié ce qui s'est passé il y a 60 ans en Allemagne et dans les pays européens occupés...
Oui, cela me révolte de voir ces images tous les jours, des hommes, des femmes, des gamins qu'on tue au vu et au su du monde entier et de voir que G. Bush (et les autres) se contente de demander poliment à Sharon de bien vouloir se retirer des territoires occupés...
Je ne supporte pas l'injustice, quelle quelle soit, où qu'elle se trouve...
Alors, envoyer un mail à G. Bush, oui pourquoi pas, mais personnellement, je ne pense pas que cela serve à quelque chose, les présidents américains ayant toujours été du côté du plus fort (quelle que soient les régions du monde...)...
Pourquoi ne pas envoyer plutôt un email à l'Union européenne, au Parlement européen... ?
Je vous envoie à tous mes amitiés et vous souhaite beaucoup de courage.
Je suis persuadée que beaucoup d'éuropéens sont à vos côtés dans votre combat de tous les jours pour regagner votre liberté...
Bien à vous
Sylvie
PS : je vais rajouter une page sur mon site avec votre message et faire un lien avec votre site... Petite goutte d'eau dans cette mer d'injustice...</b><br>

<b>Que Dieu aide les Palestiniens à gagner leurs droits et ménage enfants et  adultes de la haine impérialiste qui veut les exterminer et anihiler leurs droits . Que la paix et la justice réveille les vélléités béllicites des chefs  israéliens et des juifs, citoyens du monde ,afin qu'ils comprennent que les Arabes et les Musulmans ne leur ont rien fait qui mérite tant de haine, d'esclavage , de racisme , de crimes , et d'expropriations !
