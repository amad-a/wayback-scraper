Writings
</b><br>
Shammas’ first novel, Arabesques, was written in Hebrew and published in 1986 in Israel to wide acclaim. The book’s themes and rich and multilayered Hebrew raised questions about Israelis’ exclusive ownership of the language, and was hailed as "a turning point in Israel’s cultural life". Among his awards and honors: the 1991-92 Whiting Award, and the 1993 Lila Wallace-Reader’s Digest Writer’s Award.
