</b></p><p><b>A museum fit for martyrs<br>
The mundane possessions of Palestinians who have died in the uprising have been collected and turned into a memorial-cum-exhibition, writes Suzanne Goldenberg</b>

Samer Eweissi's catapult shot its last rock at an Israeli soldier on October   20, when the 15-year-old from the West Bank town of Qalqiliya was killed by a bullet to the lung.   It was back in action this week as art: wrapped like a present in a raffia   bow, and encased in a plexiglass cube with Samer's photograph in a stately old stone mansion in Ramallah.   
</p><p>
The transformation of Samer's carefully whittled block of wood, and the other homely artifacts on display - a child's bicycle, a Gameboy, work tools and jeans, schoolbags and copy books, and a single sock - is part of   an exhibit on the five-month Palestinian uprising called '100 Shaheed (martyrs) - 100 Lives'.   
</p><p>
"The objects in themselves have no value except that they belonged to a  martyr," said Samir Salameh, the Paris-based artist who is curator of the   exhibition at Ramallah's Khalil Sakakini cultural centre. "But now they have become precious objects; that is why I wanted to honour them."   
  </p><p>
The contrast between the care with which Mr Salameh arranged the mundane artifacts and the bloody chaos in which their owners died, is hugely dislocating. Each totem is bound up in pale cord, and then placed in a cube with the name and spare mono-coloured photograph of the owner, before being arranged in a gallery space dimly lit by tiny candles placed on the floor.  
  </p><p>
Israeli critics would argue that the exhibit glorifies violent death, and promotes a cult of martyrdom.   The Palestinian curators say that while the dead of this intifada have been   laid to rest as heros, with thousands trailing their flag-draped shrouds to   their graveyards, their families are often left to grieve alone.   
 </p><p> 
The toll in the uprising climbed above 400 this week. The Sakakini Centre's  Adila Laïdi argues that the loss of each   family is subsumed by the collective suffering of the Palestinians. Despite the tributes delivered over the graves of the dead, the deceased are soon   reduced to numbers and statistics.   But although Ms Laïdi said she wanted to immortalise the owners of the 100   objects on display here, she and the others involved in mounting the exhibit   were soon overwhelmed by the stories of their truncated lives. 
  </p><p>
They have   also been besieged by the relatives of the other dead in the uprising, who   want their loved ones included.   "We got to know them so, so well," says Ms Laïdi. "I wanted to do  something for everybody, but people kept dying every day and now I am always feeling guilty: 'what about the others?''
 </p><p> 
Field workers visited the families of the deceased in person to collect  the objects, circumventing an Israeli siege that has severed the West Bank  from Gaza, and made travel between Palestinian-ruled cities a nightmare.   At times, the results are pitiable. Some of the dead are represented by their work tools - a measuring tape or a drill. Sami Balawneh is  represented by the identity card that allowed him to work inside Israel. The magnetic ID card expires on May 19 2001; Sami was killed in the West Bank  city of Tulkarem on October 11.   The family of Yazan Halayqa, aged 14 and from Hebron, donated his blue  bicyle with a heart-shaped pillow on the handlebars that reads: "I love you this much".    
</p><p>
Many of the men and boys remembered here had so few belongings, their  families simply donated a piece of clothing. Bilal Affaneh, who was one of  the first to die in the uprising   last September, is represented by a single sock. Alaa Bani Nimrah, from the   West Bank town of Salfit, was so poor that he had never had his photograph   taken during his 15 years' in existence.  
</p><p>
"The picture is of what it is to be a Palestinian. It is a condition that is more important than your name," Ms Laïdi said. "The time of death and the circumstances of their death were dictated by the fact that they were Palestinians living under the occupation."
