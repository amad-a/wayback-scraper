  RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- An unfinished piece of embroidery.
  Paint-stained work trousers. A set of prayer beads. A school book.
  A Nike sports cap.
</p><p>
  All are personal effects of Palestinians and a foreigner killed
  during nearly five months of violence, preserved in an exhibition
  symbolizing their lives and their deaths.
</p><p>
  The exhibition that opened Tuesday, called ''100 Shaheed -- 100
  lives,'' features belongings from the dead, ranging from12-year-old
  Mohammed Aldura, whose family donated his sports shoes, to
  58-year-old taxi driver Nabil Khater, whose key chain is displayed.
</p><p>
  Since the current round of violence began on Sept. 28, 405 people
  have been killed, including 333 Palestinians, 14 Israeli Arabs, 57
  other Israelis and a German doctor.
</p><p>
  Clear plastic cases holding the different belongings reflect the
  soft light of the dimly lit halls. One man's family donated a
  birdcage. Another family offered a water pipe.
</p><p>
  ``It's as if they are bearing testimony to this thing, this
  condition of being a Palestinian. These people's lives and their
  deaths bear witness to that,'' said Adila Laidi, director of the
  Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center, a non-governmental organization
  holding the exhibition.
</p><p>
  Among those in the exhibition is German doctor Harald Fischer, who
  was struck by Israeli gunfire last November as he tried to help
  neighbors wounded in a rocket attack in Beit Jalla in the West
  Bank.
</p><p>
  His family donated a card with a black and white drawing of a
  German village.
</p><p>
  In two cases, there are personal effects but no
  photographs.
</p><p>
  ``These people are so poor they never had their photograph taken,''
  Laidi explained. ``What a horrible life that you are so poor that
  you don't even have a memento of what they looked like.''
</p><p>
  The exhibition also features a catalogue with more 200 pages of
  pictures and short biographies of the dead, alongside pictures of
  the donated items, bound together in a book printed in somber
  shades of brown.
</p><p>
  ``This catalogue unfortunately will end up presenting a snapshot of
  what it means to be a Palestinian. It's not a happy picture,''
  Laidi said.
</p><p>
  Organizers sidestepped a potential problem over the name of the
  exhibition. ``Shaheed'' is Arabic for martyr, but they refrained
  from translating the word into English, to avoid any religious
  connotation.
</p><p>
  Laidi said the center began the project by writing to the families
  and asking them to donate something for the exhibition.
</p><p>
  The U.S.-based Ford Foundation donated money to hold the
  exhibition. Laidi said the center hoped to take the display to
  other cities in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and later,
  overseas.
</p><p>
  ``In the end we were all loving them, we knew them, we knew their
  lives, we knew who they were,'' she said.
