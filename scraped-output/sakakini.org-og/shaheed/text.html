This project was conceptualized as a way to pay tribute to the fallen of
the Aqsa Intifada, the uprising that began in Jerusalem on September
29th, 2000. The idea was to shine a beacon of light onto the death
surrounding us, to break the mind-numbing anonymity of daily death
counts, and to honor the families who must live with the absence of
their loved ones and the injustice of their parting.
<p>
It seemed that the most humane way to honor the Shuhada is to celebrate
their lives, with love and dignity. To try to see them as human beings -
a boy, a teenager, a young man, a father, a grandfather,  a grandmother.
To try to feel what their lives encompassed, understanding their reality
and dreams through an anecdote, a toy, or a photograph. The banality and
fragility of each object helps us retrace a life, intact.
</p><p>
Etymologically, a Shaheed is also a “faithful witness”. Thus, the
reading of each life compellingly bears witness to a whole greater than
the sum of  the 100 biographies: An eloquent testimony to what  it means
to be a Palestinian. A condition transcending and determining the course
of each life
</p><p>
The Shuhada, regardless of age, background or geographic origin, shared
the reality of lives shackled by occupation. This starts with a family’s
loss and uprooting in the Nakba. It continues with the subsequent denied
opportunities, and miseries of a refugee’s condition. It progresses with
a litany of deprivation,  servitude, interrupted childhoods, Odyssean
like exiles, house demolitions, killings, injuries, and imprisonements.
Even those whose lives appear removed from the yoke of occupation,
succumbed to its reach with the premature timing and brutal
circumstances of their deaths.
</p><p>
Yet, these lives also incarnate the irrepressible human longing for
freedom, and the indomitable spirit of struggle. We hope that one day we
can go beyond honoring our dead, to live, as they should have been able
to: Free.
