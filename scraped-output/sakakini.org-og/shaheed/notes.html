This project was conceptualized in mid October 2000. With the project's
initial idea, the memorial exhibit and accompanying catalogue were
envisioned to be life-affirming, minimalist in nature, and to primarily
address the visual and emotional senses. Further, since one of the
project's goals was to give back each Shaheed his/her individuality, a
few governing principles for the realization of the exhibit and
catalogue were set from the start.
<p>
First, each Shaheed would have his/her own personal space, featuring
his/her name, photograph and personal object. The Shuhada would also be
presented by order of age. The objects and photographs would speak for
themselves, on their own terms, going beyond death to recreate a life;
without the clutter of text or obtrusive display devices. Artist Samir
Salameh was remarkably successful in fusing all these concepts into a
unified design for the exhibit, in a matter of only two weeks. He used
unobtrusive and individualized translucent plastic display cases for
each Shaheed. Above each one floats a transparent sheet of paper bearing
the name, and a small black and white photograph of the Shaheed. To
emphasize the sanctity of the objects displayed, he carefully wrapped
the objects, tying them with a ribbon of twine.
</p><p>
At the same time, artist Sharif Waked conceptualized the catalogue's
design, whereby each Shaheed was allocated two pages, between them a
transparent page covering the Shaheed’s face, echoing the exhibit's
display cases. To deal with the multiplicity of colors of the personal
objects and photographs, photographer Isabel de la Cruz decided to
photograph the objects in sepia, which subsequently became the unifying
color scheme of the entire catalogue. She also pre-selected the objects
displayed from the many objects each family provided. Curator Samir
Salameh made the final selection.
</p><p>
Initially, it was planned to include all the Shuhada of the Intifada in
this memorial. Sadly, it quickly became clear that the Palestinian death
toll would only continue to rise. It was, therefore, decided to limit
the scope of this tribute to the first 100 Shaheed. The fallen represent
all geographic areas of the country, including Jerusalem, the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, as well as Palestinian populated areas within Israel.
</p><p>
Then, each of the Shuhada’s families received a personal letter,
outlining the project's aims and a varied list of personal objects
needed. We are grateful to the Ministry of Social Affairs’ General
Directorate of Shuhada affairs, and to its field offices, for providing
us with a list of the Shuhada, and for diligently contacting the
majority of the families to obtain the information and objects.  In
addition, the Sakakini Centre hired a number of field workers to collect
complementary information in a few hard to reach areas.
</p><p>
The preparation stage of the project was to have taken a month, but in
fact lasted more than three months and a half, due to the encirclement
of Palestinian towns and villages, which made reaching the families of
each Shaheed almost impossible. In addition to the siege, the grief
suffered by the families further made the personal information
collection more arduous. This part of the preparation work was the most
time consuming of the whole process, as new information, stories,  and
anecdotes were constantly sought out, gathered, added, verified for
consistency and accuracy, edited, translated, etc.. Yet, there still
remains Shuhada whose biographical information remains brief. We hope to
complete it at a later stage, as this is a work in progress.
</p><p>
This memorial will be on display in seven Palestinian cities. It opened
to the public at Ramallah’s Sakakini Centre on February 20th, 2001. A
special visiting day was set aside for the families of the Shuhada. We
are still waiting to see whether the siege will allow the exhibit to be
seen in Bethlehem, Gaza City, Hebron, Jerusalem, Nablus, and Nazareth.
</p><p>
Lastly, we hope that when the Aqsa Intifada ends, this memorial exhibit
will be enlarged to include the remaining Shuhada and installed in a
permanent locale, serving as an enduring tribute to the fallen. Beyond
current limitations, this memorial is a symbolic tribute to all
Palestinians who have lost their lives in the quest for freedom.
