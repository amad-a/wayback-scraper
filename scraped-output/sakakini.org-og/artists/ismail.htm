<p></p><div align="justify"><a href="ismailp.htm">Ismaïl Shammout</a>&nbsp; is considered to
be a founder of modern Palestinian visual arts, holding the first stand-alone
painting exhibit in Gaza City in 1953. He is a prolific and consistent
painter of realist scenes of the Palestinian tragedy and struggle: The
Nakba, the exodus of refugees, civilians’ massacres, the rise of resistance
and the <i>Fedayeen</i>, as well as idyllic depictions of Palestinian rural
life. Many of his works are widely reproduced in Palestinian publications,
and became domestic icons of sorts.&nbsp; Born in 1930 in Lydda, his family
sought refuge in Khan Yunis after the Nakba. He studied at Cairo’s fine
arts college and at Rome’s fine arts academy.&nbsp; He was appointed in
1965 as head of the PLO’s fine arts department, and&nbsp; obtained a special
Palestine Award for visual arts in 1997. He has exhibited widely throughout
the world, and now lives and works in Jordan, where he has been experimenting
with computer art. He has written extensively on Palestinian art.
