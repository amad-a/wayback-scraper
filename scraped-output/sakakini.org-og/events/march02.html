          and community shelter for disinherited women. She, however, soon falls 
          in love with a young man and breaks the rules of the Zaouia by bringing 
          him home with her, forcing a confrontation with the other women.<br>

          This documentary features portraits of 8 Palestinian women. These are 
          not exceptional women or women leaders in <br>
          the news media sense. They are civilian women who reject the degrading, 
          terrorizing drama of war. They are from <br>
          different backgrounds and professions attempting to live morally in 
          inhuman times, holding on to their ability to <br>
          reflect on themselves and their condition.<br>

          Alia is born to serve men. Her mother is a servant in the palace of 
          the Bey - dispensing food and her body, to the <br>
          royal princes of Tunisia. As Alia, now a singer in post colonial Tunisia, 
          looks at her own childhood in the palace in the <br>
          1960's, she must come to terms with the meaning of her mother's life 
          and the tradition of bondage she's attempting <br>
          to escape. Moufida Tlatli's quietly observant eye records the beauty, 
          decadence, and the horror of this stifling, now <br>
          vanished world.<br>
          Director: Moufida Tlatli. 127 mins., 1994, Tunisia. (Arabic language

          A young Shiite teenage girl roams the streets of Beirut during the Lebanese 
          civil war. Her sole knowledge of life <br>
          comes from Egyptian films and the civil war around her - both highly 
          deformed pictures of reality. Twice made <br>
          homeless, once from her village in Southern Lebanon, and then in Beirut, 
          she forms a small band of children 'militia' <br>
          who collect stones from the shelled buildings for the rebuilding of 
          Beirut. She comes of age, both emotionally and <br>
          sexually, as she befriends her local 'neighborhood' sniper and a French 
          artist, and lives on the edge.<br>
          Director: Jocelyn Saab, 100 mins., 1985. (Arabic language, Lebanese
