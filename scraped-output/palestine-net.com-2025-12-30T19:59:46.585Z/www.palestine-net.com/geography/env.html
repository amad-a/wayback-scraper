<h1>Palestine: Geography - Environment</h1>
 <h2>Environmental Priorities in Palestine</h2>  
Follows is a summary of the major environmental issues in Palestine as 
stated in many Environmental workshops and seminars held recently in 
Palestine to discuss this issue. This summary has been collected by the 
environmental group at An-Najah University in Nablus, Palestine. 
<ul>
 <li><b> WASTEWATER:</b> 
<br> This is a major issue in almost all cities and villages 
in Palestine.  Treatment and reuse of wastewater is a first priority.
  <li> <b>SOLID WASTE:</b><br>  This issue gets as much attention as the 
first
one. It is predominantly clear in Gaza strip and in the main cities in the
West Bank. Treatment and recycling of solid waste is the subject for many
studies done on this subject in the region.
  <li> <b>ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS AND EDUCATION:</b><br>  
The participation of the public in finding solutions for
the major environmental issues and also the public awareness of the
importance for dealing with these issues gets much attention from
officials and environmental groups in Palestine.
  <li> <b>ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS:</b><br> 
Officials in the Palestine Authority have been working hard on drafts for
the laws, regulations and law enforcement. The Palestine council is
expected to discuss and approve such regulations this year 1996. 
<li> OTHER MAJOR ISSUES ARE:<ul> 
 <li> AIR POLLUTION.
 <li> CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY. 
 <li> NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION.
