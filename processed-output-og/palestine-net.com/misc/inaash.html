    <h1>ADPCL: Association for the Development of Palestinian Camps in Lebanon</h1>
     In'aash, the Arabic name of the above association, means revival but the actualwork of the association is more of a survival than anything else. The embroideryworks done there are both a step towards cultural preservation and self - suffiency.After Oslo I, II, ...infinity, the cause of the Palestinian refugees has been marginalized if not eliminated even from political discussions.

              <h2>About In'aash: Our Goals</h2>
               To improve the living environment in the Palestinian refugee camps. Tostimulate the development of women, children, and youth and motivate theirprogress. To raise the cultural, educational and economic standing of therefugees in the Palestinian Camps in Lebanon. 
              <p>
                Since its founding in 1969, the Association has started several projects,the expenses of which have been covered partly by generous donations butmainly by the income generated from the marketing and selling of thebeautiful Palestinian hand embroidered products symbolized mainly by: TheCushion. 
                <p>
                  Our cushions are exquisitely embroidered with beautiful designs derivedfrom the specific patterns and motifs found on the different villagersdresses, associated with specific Palestinian villages. Just as thesedresses, still worn today have acquired a new significance as expressionsof a Palestinian National Identity, the cushion, in its turn, has becomeanother symbol of a nation's National Heritage. 
                  <p>
                    In the context of a dispersed and fragmented society, in an era wheretradition and culture have become extremely precious, one means of savingsome of the values of a nation has become the preserving, reproducing andpromoting of the heritage of the Traditional Palestinian Embroidery. 
                    <p>
                      The Association for the Development of Palestinian Camps is a Lebanesesocial and cultural association founded in 1969 by a group of Lebanese &amp;Palestinian ladies. These ladies foresaw the necessity of preserving theheritage of traditional Palestinian embroidery which would also bringmeans of financial support to many needy families in the camps. Ourcurrent projects are administered by several dedicated employees under theguidance and advice of a group of volunteers who are usually members ofthe General Assembly of the elected Board of Directors.
