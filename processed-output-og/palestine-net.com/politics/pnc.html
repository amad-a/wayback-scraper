    <em>Part of the papers signed by Arafat and Rabin states that Arafat should remove, from the PNC, clauses that Rabin and Co don't like within 2 months from the January, 20, 1996 'council elections'. The history of the PNC is quitecomplicated (drafted under the Arab league supervision earlier, then called:"al-miithaaq al-Qawmi al-Arabi ... etc - it is not difficult to spot the pan-Arab and soscialist spices scattered around). A good source is the book by FaisalHuuraani: The History of the PNC [Arabic]. The translation below is copiedfrom the source at the end. You may want to ask if the other side had toedit/modify their own documents ... you probably know the answer.</em>

    "This covenant will be called The Palestinian National Covenant ( 
    <em>al-mithaq al-watani al-filastini</em>
     ). 
    <strong>Article 1:</strong>
     Palestine is the homeland of the Palestinian Arab people and an integral part of the great Arab homeland, and the people of Palestine isa part of the Arab nation. 
    <strong>Article 2:</strong>
     Palestine with its boundaries that existed at thetime of the British mandate is an integral regional unit. 
    <strong>Article 3:</strong>
     The Palestinaian Arab people possesses the lega right to itshomeland, and when the liberation of its homeland is completed it will exercise self-determination solely according to its own will and choice. 
    <strong>Article 4:</strong>
     The Palestinian personality is an innate, persistentcharacteristic that does not disappear, and it is transferred from fathers tosons. The Zionist occupation, and the dispersal of the Palestinian Arab people as a result of the disasters which came over it, do not deprive it from its Palestinian personality and affiliation and do not nullify them. 
    <strong>Article 5:</strong>
     The Palestinians are the Arab citizens who wereliving permanently in Palestine until 1947, whether they were expelled from there or remained. Whoever is born to a Palestinian Arab father after thisdate, within Palestine or outside it, is a Palestinian. 
    <strong>Article 6:</strong>
     Jews who were living permanently in Palestineuntil the beginning of the Zionist invasion will be considered Palestinians. [For the dating of the Zionist invasion, considered to have begun in 1917]. 
    <strong>Article 7:</strong>
     The Palestinian affiliation and the material, Spiritualand historical tie with Palestine are permanent realities. The upbringing ofthe Palestinian individual in an Arab and revolutionary fashion, the undertakingof all means of forging consciousness and training the Palestinian, in orderto acquiant him profoundly with his homeland spiritually and materially, andpreparing him for the conflict and the armed struggle, as well as for thesacrifice of his property and his life to restore his homeland, until theliberation of all this is a national duty. 
    <strong>Article 8:</strong>
     The phase in which the people of Palestine isliving is that of natioan ( 
    <em>watani</em>
     ) struggle for the liberation of Palestine. Therefore the contradictions among the Palestinain national forcesare of secondary order which must be suspended in the interest of the fundamental contradiction between Zionism and colonialism on the one side andthe Palestinian Arab people on the other. On this basis, the Palestinian masses, whether in the homeland or in places of exile ( 
    <em>mahajir</em>
     ), organizationsand individuals, comprise one national front which acts to restore Palestineand liberate it through armed struggle. 
    <strong>Article 9:</strong>
     Armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestineand is therefore a strategy and not tactics. The Palestinian Arab people affirmsits absolute resolution and abiding determination to pursue the armed struggleand to march forward towards the armed popular revolution, to liberate itshomeland and return to it [to maintain] its right to a natural life in it, andto exercise its right of self-determination in it and sovereignty over it. 
    <strong>Article 10:</strong>
     Fedayeen action forms the nucleous of the popularPalestinian war of liberation. This demands its promotion, extension and protection, and the mobilization of all the masses and scientific capacities of the palestinians, their organization and involvement in the armed Palestinianrevolution and cohesion in the national ( 
    <em>watani</em>
     ) struggle among the various groups of the people of palestine, and between them and the Arabmasses, to guarantee the continuation of the revolution, its advancement andvictory. 
    <strong>Article 11:</strong>
     The Palestinians will have three mottoes: national( 
    <em>wataniyya</em>
     ) unity, national ( 
    <em>qawmiyya</em>
     ) mobilization and liberation. 
    <strong>Article 12:</strong>
     The Palestinian Arab people believes in Arab unity. In order to fulfill its role in realizing this, it must preserve, in this phase of its national ( 
    <em>watani</em>
     ) struggle, its Palestinian personality andthe constituents thereof, increase consciousness of its existence and resistsany plan that tends to disintegrate or weaken it. 
    <strong>Article 13:</strong>
     Arab unity and the liberation of palestine are twocomplementary aims. Each one paves the way for the realization of the other.Arab unity leads to the liberation of Palestine and the liberation of Plaestine leads to Arab unity. Working for both goes hand in hand. 
    <strong>Article 14:</strong>
     The destiny of the Arab nation, indeed the very Arabexistence, depends on the destiny of the Palestine issue. The endeavour andeffort of the Arab nation to liberate Palestine follows from this connection.The people of Palestine assumes its vanguard role in realizing this sacrednational ( 
    <em>qawmi</em>
     ) aim. 
    <strong>Article 15:</strong>
     The liberation of Palestine, from the Arab viewpoint, is a national ( 
    <em>qawmi</em>
     ) duty to repulse the Zionist, Imperialist invasion from the great Arab homeland and to purge the Zionist presence from Palestine. Its full responsibility falls upon the Arab nation, peoples andgovernments, wth the Palestinian Arab people at their head. For this purpose,the Arab nation must mobilize all its military, human, material and spiritualcapacities to participate actively with the Palestinian people in the liberationof Palestine. They must, especially in the present stage of armed Palestinianrevolution, grant and offer the people of Palestine all possible help and everymaterial and human support, and afford it every sure means and opportunityenabling it to continue to assume its vanguads role in pursuing its armedrevolution until the liberation of its homeland. 
    <strong>Article 16:</strong>
     The liberation of Palestine, from a spiritual viewpoint,will prepare an atmosphere of tranquillity and peace for the Holy Land in the shade of which all the Holy Places will be safeguarded, and freedom of worshipand visitation to all will be guaranteed, without distinction or discriminationof race, color, language or religion. For this reason, the people of Palestine looks to the support of all the spiritual forces in the world. 
    <strong>Article 17:</strong>
     The liberation of Palestine, from a human viewpoint willrestore to the Palestinian man* his dignity, glory and freedom. For this, thePalestinian Arab people looks to the support of those in the world who believein the dignity and freedom of man*. 
    <strong>Article 18:</strong>
     The liberation of Palestine, from an international viewpoint,is a defensive act necessiated by the requirements of self-defence. For thisreason the Arab people of Palestine, desiring to befriend all peoples, looks to the support of the states which love freedom, justice and peace in restoringthe legal situation to Palestine, establishing security and peace in its territory,and enabling its people to exercise national ( 
    <em>wataniyya</em>
     ) sovereignty andnational ( 
    <em>qawmiyya</em>
     ) freedom. 
    <strong>Article 19:</strong>
     The partition of Palestine in 1947 and the establishmentof Israel is fundamentally null and void, whatever time has elapsed, because itwas contrary to the wish of the people of Palestine and its natural right toits homeland, and contradicts the principles embodied in the Charter of the UN,the first of which is the right of self determination. 
    <strong>Article 20:</strong>
     The Balfour Declaration, the Mandate document, and whathas been based upon them are considered null and void. The claim of a historicalor spiritual tie between Jews and Palestine does not tally with historicalrealities nor with the constituents of statehood in their true sense. Judaism,in its character as a religion of revelation, is not a nationality with an independent existence. Likewise, the Jews are not one people with an independentpersonality. They are rather citizens of the states to which they belong. 
    <strong>Article 21:</strong>
     The Palestinian Arab people, in expressing itself through thearmed Palestinian revolution, rejects every solution that is a substitute fora complete liberation of Palestine, and rejects all plans that aim at thesettlement of the Palestine issue or its internationalization. 
    <strong>Article 22:</strong>
     Zionism is a political movement organically related toworld Imperialism and hostile to all movements of liberation and progress inthe world. It is a racist and fanatical movement in its formation: agressive,expansionist and colonialist in its aims; and fascist and Nazi in its means.Israel is the tool of the Zionist movement and a human and geographical basefor world Imperialism. It is a concentration and jumping-off point for Imperialismin the heart of the Arab homeland, to strike at the hopes of the Arab nationfor liberation, unity and prograss. 
    <strong>Article 23:</strong>
     The demands of security and peace and the requirementsof truth and justice oblige all states that preserve friendly relations amongpeoples and maintan the loyalty of citizens to their homelands to considerZionism an illegetimate movement and to prohibit its existence and activity. 
    <strong>Article 24:</strong>
     The alestinian Arab people believes in the principle of justice,freedom, sovereignty, self-determination, human dignity and the right of peoplesto exercise them.
