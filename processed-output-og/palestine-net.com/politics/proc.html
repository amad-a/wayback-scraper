    " The Land of Israel was the birthplace of the Jewish people. Here theirspiritual, religious and national identity was formed. Here they achievedindependence and created a culture of national and universal significance. Herethey wrote and gave the Bible to the world. Exiled from the Land of Israel, the Jewish people remained faithful to itin all the countries of their dispersion, never ceasing to pray and hope fortheir return and the restoration of their national freedom. Impelled by this hiostoric association Jews strove throughout the centuriesto go back to the land of their fathers and regain their statehood. In recentdecades they returned in their masses. They reclaimed the wilderness, rvived their language, built cities and villages, and established a vigorous andever-growing community, with its own economic and cultural life. They sought peace yet were prepared to defend themselves. They brought the blessings of progress to all inhabitants of the country and looked forward to sovereign independence. In the year 1897 the First Zionist Congress, inspired by Theodor Herzl'svision of the Jewish State, proclaimed the right of the Jewish people to national revival in their own country. This right was acknowledged by the Balfour Declaration of November 2, 1917,and re-affirmed by the mandate of the League of Nations, which gave explicitinternational recognition to the historic connection of the Jewish people withPalestine and their right to reconstitute their National Home. The recent holocaust, which engulfed millions of Jews in Europe, proved anew the need to solve the problem of the homelessness and lack of independenceof the Jewish people by means of the re-establishment of the Jewish State,which would open the gates to all Jews and endow the Jewish people with equalityof status among tyhe family of nations. The survivors of the disastrius slaughter in Europe, and also Jews from other lands, have not desisted from efforts to reach 
    <em>Eretz Israel</em>,
    in face of difficulties, obstacles and perils; and have not ceased to urge theirright to a life of dignity, freedom and honest toil in their ancestral land. In the Second World War the Jewish people in Palestine made their fullcontribution to the struggle of the freedom-loving nations against the Nazievil. The sacrifices of their soldiers and their war effort gained them the right to rank with the nations which founded the United Nations. On November 29, 1947, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a Resolution requiring the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine. TheGeneral Assembly caloled upon the inhabitants of the country to take all thenecessary steps on their part to put the plan into effect. This recognitionby the United Nations of the right of the Jewish people to establish theirindependent State is unassailable. It is the natural right of the Jewish peole to lead, as do all other nations, an independent existence in its sovereign State.ACCORDINGLY WE, the members of the National Council, representing theJewish people in Palestine, and the World Zionist Movement, are met togetherin solemn assembly today, the day of termination of the British mandate for Palestine; and by virtue of the natural and historic right of the Jewish peopleand of the Resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations.WE HEREBY PROCLAIM the establishment of the Jewish State in Palestineto be called '
    <em>Medinal Israel</em>
     ' (The State of Israel). WE HEREBY DECLARE that, as from the termination of the British Mandate atmidnight, the 14th-15th May, 1948, and pending the setting up of the duly elected bodies of the State in accordance with a Constitution, to be drwan upby the Constituent Assembly not later than the 1st October, 1948, the NationalCouncil shall act as the Provisional State Council, and that the NationalAdministration shall constitute the Provisional Government of the Jewish State,which shall be known as Israel.THE STATE OF ISRAEL will be open for immigration of Jews from allcountries of their dispersion; will promote the development of the country forthe benefit of all its inhabitants; will be based on the principles of liberty,justice and peace as conceived by the Prophets of Israel, will uphold the fullsocial and political equality of all its citizens, without distinction of religion, race or sex;will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, educationand culture; will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions; and will loyallyuphold the principles of the United Nations Charter.THE STATE OF ISRAEL will be ready to cooperate with the organs and representatives of the United Nations in the implementation of the Resolution of the Assembly of November, 29, 1947, and will take steps tobring about Economic Union over the whole of Palestine. We appeal to the United Nations to assist the Jewish people in the buildingof its State and to admit Israel into the family of Nations. In the midst of wanton aggression, we yet call upon the Arab inhabitants ofthe State of Israel to preserve the ways of peace and play their part in thedevelopment of the State, on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its bodies and institutions - provisional and permanent. We extend our hand in peace and neighbourliness to all the neighbouring states and their peoples, and invite them to co-operate with the independentJewish nation for the common good of all. The State of Israel is prepared tomake its contribution to the progress of the Middle East as a whole. Our call goes out to the Jewish people all over the world to rally to our side in the task of immigration and development and to stand by us in the great struggle for the fulfilment of the dream of generations for the redemption of Israel. With trust in Almighty God, we set our hand to this Declaration, at thisSession of the Provisional State Council, on this Sabbath eve, the fifth of Iyar, 5708, the fourteenth day of May, 1948."---------
