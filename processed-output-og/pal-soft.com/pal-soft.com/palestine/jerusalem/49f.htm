Israeli  army soldiers shot dead at least eight Palestinians, including two
children below the age of fifteen.
Among  the victims was Ahmed Samir Basal (14 year old) from Gaza, who along
with an unidentified 18 year old boy were killed when an Israeli tank fired
a volley of machinegun rounds on a group of boys and children who were just
looking from a very close distant.
Two  other youths were also shot dead by Israeli soldiers in Tulkarm, Fathi
Juma'a Salim (20 years old) and Salem Khayri (22 years old).
Two  more  boys from the village of Sammou, 20 km south west of Hebron were
shot  dead  near the southern entrance of the village. The boys are Jaddoun
abu Kbash (13 years old) and Karim abu Awwad (14 years old).
Twenty more boys were seriously injured, and one of them reportedly died on
his way to hospital in Hebron.
Israeli  tanks  shelled with heavy artillery many buildings in the heart of
Ramallah,   including   the  headquarters  of  the  PA  ministry  of  Local
Governance, headed by PA negotiator Sa'eb Ureikat.
Here are some photos of today :
