      The policeman opens fire. Other policeman ran to offer covering fire. This response was to unleash an assault by a helicopter gunship on the apartment building.

      In the car park at the back of the apartment building, Palestinian police open fire on the hillside above. In the next entry, the effects of the resulting helicopter attack are clearly seen.

      During the attack, this Palestinian policeman, injured on the roof when fire converged on him from three sides (an indication of the fire control Israel had on the situation), was evacuated by civillian residents of the building. After they got him down, into a waiting ambulance, Israeli snipers opened fire on these civillians. The bullet holes can still be seen in the red awning. Fortunately, none were injured.
