      <i>Abdelrahim Mahmud - 1937</i>

      <font size="+1">
        I will carry my soul in my hand 
        <br>
        And throw it in the valleys of death 
        <br>
        It is either a life that makes a friend happy 
        <br>
        Or a death that makes an enemy angry 
        <br>
        The noble man's soul has two goals 
        <br>
        To die or to achieve its dreams 
        <br>
        What is life if I don't live 
        <br>
        Feared and what I have is forbidden to others 
        <br>
        When I speak, all the world listens 
        <br>
        And my voice echoes among people 
        <br>
        I see my death, but I rush to it 
        <br>
        This is the death of men 
        <br>
        And whoever desires an honorable death 
        <br>
        Then this is it 
        <br>
        How am I patient with the spiteful 
        <br>
        And patient with all this pain? 
        <br>
        Is it because of fear? 
        <br>
        While life has no value to me! 
        <br>
        Or humiliation? While I am contemptuous! 
        <br>
        I will throw my heart at my enemies' faces 
        <br>
        And my heart is iron and fire! 
        <br>
        I will protect my land with the edge of the sword 
        <br>
        So my people will know that I am the man 
        <br>
