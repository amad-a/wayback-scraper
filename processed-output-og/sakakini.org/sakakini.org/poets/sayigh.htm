        <b>
          DEPARTURE 
          <br></b>
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>In this moment of departure,</p>
    <p>point your red arrows,</p>
    <p>disarm the lightning, and open wide</p>
    <p>the gate to my exile.</p>
    <p>Close the sky's open face, and ride away.</p>
    <p>I long so deeply that the shores unfold their seas</p>
    <p>and horses bolt!</p>
    <p>Now I'll carry the roads and palm trees in my suitcase,</p>
    <p>I'll lock my tears in the evening's copybooks</p>
    <p>
      and seal the seasons. 
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's begin our song: here is Beirut 
      <i>wearing</i>
       you
    </p>
    <p>like her own clothes.</p>
    <p>You must sit well on the surface of her glory</p>
    <p>abandoning tears</p>
    <p>In her blue froth</p>
    <p>She contains you like eternity</p>
    <p>
      like the sense of beginning that comes with certainty 
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      -How can you be dead, yet so absolutely present ? 
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>Let the rivers abandon their skies,</p>
    <p>and the seas dry out !</p>
    <p>Everything in the universe has an end</p>
    <p>
      except my split blood... 
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>Each time I think of it</p>
    <p>You remain as large as your death.</p>
    <p>The war planes choose you, discover you, plant</p>
    <p>their blackness in you.</p>
    <p>From all those clouded last visions,</p>
    <p>how will you begin the story of harvest?</p>
    <p>We planes select you,</p>
    <p>at the start of your sleep,</p>
    <p>at the end of your sleep.</p>
    <p>How often did the sky explode over you</p>
    <p>with hatred?</p>
    <p>How often were you taken aside?</p>
    <p>How many massacres did you survive ?</p>
    <p>Now you collect all the wounds, taking refuge with</p>
    <p>death,</p>
    <p>wearing dreams as wings.</p>
