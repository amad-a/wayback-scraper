          the grasses under them had turned to hearts.

        <dt>It is said:</dt>
        <dt>wheatstalks bloomed beneath his sleeves.</dt>
        <dt>It is said:</dt>
        <dt>the birds carried his blood</dt>
        <dt>to his beloved cousins.</dt>
        <dt>He shall return</dt>
        <dt>Blossoming with volcanoes,</dt>
        <dt>and fill again his mother's breasts.</dt>
        <dt>When they found him green as light</dt>
        <dt>they shrouded him with rose buds,</dt>
        <dt>they spread out the sky to lay him on</dt>
        <dt>and made the sun his pillow.</dt>
