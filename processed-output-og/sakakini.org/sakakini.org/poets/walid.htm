          The cloud of migration is in his eyes,
        </dt>
        <dt>and in the leather briefcase the book, the pencil, the family photograph</dt>
        <dt>the rust of benches on his hands, the rust of bannisters and doorknobs,</dt>
        <dt>the rust of handshakes on his hands.</dt>
        <dt>The briefcase propped against the wall-</dt>
        <dt>will he take out his souvenirs first, or will he</dt>
        <dt>like a magician take out a country:</dt>
        <dt>a house,</dt>
        <dt>a street,</dt>
        <dt>a capital.</dt>
        <dt>He closed his eye, lay back against the shoulder of familiar habits.</dt>
        <dt>He will not make friends with another vase,</dt>
        <dt>he will not confess to a bed that will blow up in the next war,</dt>
        <dt>he will not make tea or sing.</dt>
        <dt>He will pace back and forth for a long time betwthe porch and</dt>
        <dt>the kitchen</dt>
        <dt>and he will listen hard for a sound coming from the garden gate.</dt>
        <dt>But there is only the crunching of leaves under feet</dt>
        <dt>passing</dt>
        <dt>then</dt>
        <dt>going on;</dt>
        <dt>there is nothing but the hum of talk in the houses next door.</dt>
