In 1948,a few days before the city was divided and its western part seized by theIsraelis, the Sakakinis fled Jerusalem, the last Palestinian family remainingin the Qatamon quarter ravaged by Israeli mortar attacks. They left withonly their personal effects, and sought refuge in Cairo where Sakakiniwas nominated by the Egyptian writer Taha Hussein to join the Arabic LanguageAcademy. The sudden death of his son Sari in 1953 left him in poor health,and he died three months later on August 13, 1953.</font>
